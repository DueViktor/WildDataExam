imizm9v,t3_x2f66q,"ETH on Polygon was deposited via. a bridge. You don't have custody of that mainnet ETH, so therefore no.",t3_x2f66q
imj7hbx,t3_x2f66q,"There is no ETH stored on the polygon network - not yours nor anyone else's, the eth you had is in the bridge contract on the ethereum side, it's not yours anymore. All you have is an IOU.

tldr: you get nothing",t3_x2f66q
imj1get,t3_x2f66q,No because you don’t own it,t3_x2f66q
imjaopl,t1_imizm9v,"So if I bridge this ""eth"" to the mainnet will that do it?",t3_x2f66q
imnaqe8,t1_imj7hbx,Just because something is in a smart contract doesn’t mean it’s not yours,t3_x2f66q
imjl48x,t1_imjaopl,"If you bridge it back, yes. But note we don't know if this hard fork will occur, nor will we know how many miners will secure it. It's price will be dictated by a variety of forces.",t3_x2f66q
imne841,t1_imnaqe8,that is correct in general... it this particular case the eth in the bridge really is not his,t3_x2f66q
imk0733,t1_imjl48x,I think any fork will be basically worthless if it happens at all.,t3_x2f66q
imkvpzr,t1_imk0733,"Well, the market thinks you're wrong. Futures/IOUs show it's actually bigger than ETC at the moment. Where is 900 TH/s going to go?",t3_x2f66q
imkwxva,t1_imkvpzr,I will believe it is worth something once I see it happen. There will be so much sell pressure and defi will all be broken. It looks destined to be a post apocalypse wasteland of a chain down there with other forks like bsv to me.,t3_x2f66q
imln2fo,t1_imkvpzr,For it to be worth anything someone has to buy it and I don't see anyone talking about doing that. Everyone is just fantasizing about an airdrop they can sell.,t3_x2f66q
imkyg9h,t1_imkwxva,They are security networks after all. Ethos-wise I agree with you.,t3_x2f66q
