imf5v86,t3_x1pqip,"Not a developer, but love the idea and 100% support it. Sounds like you know the farming business, and I can see this as an asset similar to a farmland REIT.",t3_x1pqip
imfsjcr,t3_x1pqip,"This sounds like a really good idea. Might be difficult to bootstrap a farmland stablecoin, but it would be a smart real world asset to underpin the value of a stablecoin.",t3_x1pqip
img0g5a,t3_x1pqip,"For #1, this doesn't really accomplish it because most developed countries have no legal framework to delegate ownership to a block chain. So selling land will still require title/deed transfers and if financed probably require title insurance.",t3_x1pqip
imgq9a9,t3_x1pqip,"Putting the deed on a blockchain doesn't really do anything to make it cheaper, only puts it on a distributed ledger. They already have ledgers with this information on them outside of blockchain. There are still governments that require deeds, taxes, and fees, as well as the quality, and environmental inspections. The planning and zoning still needs to be paid. This would.all still have centralization since someone would have to make the decisions about when to raise, or lower lease prices, and just the management of the leases. The wrong person doing that, charging to much, to little, or violating lease terms, could destroy all of the dividends that should be going to the stakers. If this was a significant amount of farmland, it would take a company of dozens of employees to run. Not trying to shoot ya down, but that would be a tall order. We couldn't even increase the bitcoin blocksize without forking into a few dozen chains. Even though literally everyone wanted to, and the only argument was about how big to make them, and the specific client to impliment. Something like that should be simple, but it totally split the community, and the problem was never solved. The blocksize is still the exact same size. A DAO in charge of maintaining and leasing huge amounts of farmland sounds like a nightmare honestly. I do like the idea of gettimg the farmland out of the hands of Bill Gates, and other oligarchs.",t3_x1pqip
img2sdj,t1_img0g5a,"I understand that, but I see that as a change coming. I read a few months ago about Propy putting their first residential home on chain, but unclear on details of the process.",t3_x1pqip
img4y2x,t1_img2sdj,"Similar ideas on Algorand build a LLC per property and then fractionalize ownership by selling shares in the LLC. As far as I know, it is simple faith that the legal owner of the shares will respect the on-chain ownership.",t3_x1pqip
