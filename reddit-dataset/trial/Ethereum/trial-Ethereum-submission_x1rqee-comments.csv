imfesck,t3_x1rqee,They hate him cause they ain't him,t3_x1rqee
imfbf99,t3_x1rqee,He isnâ€™t hated so much except by faceless internet trolls who make fun of his appearance. There are haters galore in almost every Twitter comment section,t3_x1rqee

imfdark,t3_x1rqee,Is he?,t3_x1rqee
imfehts,t3_x1rqee,"I don't think he is hated. He is trolling and being trolled. Internet culture jokes. 
One of the brightest minds of the last decade I would say.",t3_x1rqee

imfpw7l,t3_x1rqee,"Twitter is not a good measure of what people in the real world think.  Vitalik is one of the least controversial and most widely-liked people who have anything to do with crypto.  He is generally kind to everyone and doesn't get involved in bickering and wars.  (This is one of the reasons that if he ever does say anything even remotely negative about a topic it gets such much attention).   He takes a surprisingly long-term and optimistic view for someone his age and it has resulted in a healthy Ethereum community that keeps moving forward and building things, despite the noise, ponzis, and charlatans.",t3_x1rqee
img6pdn,t3_x1rqee,Its a joke. The memes are all love.   Twitter is a different world.,t3_x1rqee
imhyj2z,t3_x1rqee,"I greatly admire him.

Not only for his work on crypto and his thoughtful articles, but he's also the epitome of personal freedom. He goes everywhere he wants, has virtually unlimited funds - yet lives out of his backpack and doesn't have to care about anything. Probably the only person in the world who could turn up at the Oscar Night wearing a pink unicorn shirt and still get applause.",t3_x1rqee
imi3th4,t3_x1rqee,"Well, personally I hate him because he said women should carry children in synthetic wombs instead their own body.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5286449/


As a person with ""high functioning"" (read: mostly maskable) autism, I can speak on the (personal anecdotal) accuracy of this study, and am presenting it in the context of your question to add so e scientific validity to this personal experience. Vitalik is very obviously on the spectrum, and in his neurodivergence clearly does not feel the need to ascribe to social norms of personal presentation or ""tact"" (this is how revolutionary/visionary minds work- see Issac Newton's personal story for another clear historical anecdote in a similar vein).",t3_x1rqee

imfmzg7,t1_imfd695,"Indeed, it's considering a chain guilty due to jealousy. And it's considering anyone associated to that chain guilty by association, notably the most prominent figures, regardless of what they did. 

It's pretty common bias, even.",t3_x1rqee

imfdj5v,t1_imfbr2w,"Vitalik's presenting himself quite well, this has nothing to do with autism. He's simply hated (by a minority of internet trolls) because he's successful.",t3_x1rqee
imfnvqv,t1_imfdkqx,"We're making fun of other blockchains? Aren't you confused with BTC? They're the ones calling anything that isn't BTC a scam, or even worse.

In here, all we say is warning about decentralization issues. But even with decentralization issues, chains can still be useful and are proving to be useful everyday. It's just not the same use and, as such, can't provide the same service or be direct competitors or, somehow, ""killers"", as some chains have claimed to be. 

It's not our fault if some chains are officially willing to be cutthroat competitors when they've also designed themselves not to be competitors in the first place. But not being direct competitors isn't bad in any way. It means the useful possibility to be partners.

It's good they aren't competitors, as it makes the ecosystem richer, though we'd still need at least one or two competitors so that innovation thrives.",t3_x1rqee

imfwx5m,t1_imfdj5v,"While I agree he has a type of charisma, is there also a potential in your mind for a grand and complex world where these are both factors as opposed to ""simply"" envy? I would point out that outright dismissal of the impact and reception of autism is an act of erasure in a place where the basic acknowledgment of Vitalik's clear (and diagnosed) ASD presents an opportunity to build some popular awareness of the value of neurodiverse minds as opposed to minimizing this to scarcity mentality/capitalist envy. I am comfortable saying both of these are likely factors in the online hate he receives.",t3_x1rqee
imfpukl,t1_imfnvqv,"Articles, maxis (every blockchain) and VCs, bots. Crypto currency reddit sub page. Everything about Crypto is other Jerry Springer show episode. 

It's very toxic that's why i try to stay out of it. But op just ask why do people make fun of Vatalik and like I said it's maxis that cause the problem or little kids just start non debatable agreement. Aka FUD.",t3_x1rqee
img3w6v,t1_imfwx5m,"Not on the spectrum myself, and know regrettably little about it, but I'm inclined to agree with you. Brought home to me by his recent lengthy blog post on the most economical way to pack a rucksack. Classic Vitalik and I absolutely loved it. But it came around the bottom (so far!) of the bear market and naturally there were 100s of Twitter comments from slack-jawed morons along the lines of ""ur crypto has just gon down x, why r u riting about rucksacks?"" 

You either ""get"" Vitalik or you don't.",t3_x1rqee

Don't worry, we're ok and I never take any grudge for mere mistakes. 

Also know, if it's not already the case, that you're better than many others for being quick at acknowledging your mistakes and building upon it.",t3_x1rqee
