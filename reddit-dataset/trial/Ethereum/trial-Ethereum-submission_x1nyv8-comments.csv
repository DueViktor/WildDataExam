imewqa1,t3_x1nyv8,"What a shit thread. 
IF there’s a hard fork and EthPoW is created, you’d get airdropped those tokens. You wouldn’t pay taxes until you sold them. As someone else stated, since there isn’t a historical price, it would be expected to start at $0. I wouldn’t worry at all unless you sell these tokens. And the likely-hood of a split is low imo",t3_x1nyv8
imeug2e,t3_x1nyv8,"What I've seen from other tax professionals is that the upgrade to PoS is not a taxable event. But unlike the thread suggested, because there is no historical price data for any potential new fork of Ethereum, the event is not taxable as income. The initial value is $0 and would become the tax cost basis that you should record and keep track of (with the date you obtained it). You wouldn't pay tax on this until you sold, and you would pay capital gains on the price you sold at.",t3_x1nyv8
imfjd8s,t3_x1nyv8,"What you are describing is completely in par with you having a physical key to your physical house. Then, someone knocks at your door to tell you that your key appears to also open the door of 5 other houses at the other side of the planet on an island and that, a few minutes after these houses were constructed, ten houses around them were traded for a lot of money.

The person at your door then claims you're owing taxes for these houses you've just received based on the trades that happened after they were built without your consent. 

Except that it's been all happening 2 years ago and you failed to pay taxes on these houses. The person at your door is thus informing you that you've been frauding. 

That's the physical world equivalent of what you're describing. Because anyone can fork anything without your knowledge and then make a trade of what's been forked, also without your knowledge.

If so, expect people to inform the IRS that IRS people owe lots of taxes and are frauding, because that's what they're subjecting themselves to the instant they enforce their supposed interpretation of the law.",t3_x1nyv8

imf2pfp,t1_imewqa1,"I replied to the other person, but be very careful taking this approach. The IRS will come in and say income from a fork is taxable, and the income amount would be when the fork has value.  


You're right, this is an if scenario, but it's also to warn people in advance that they likely have a tax bill in this circumstance, so be prepared.",t3_x1nyv8
imf2ht0,t1_imeug2e,"This is not true for US investors.   
IRS guidance says income is to be picked up from forked coins when they have value. If this value is $0, the first moment it does have value is the income you would pick up.",t3_x1nyv8

imffqs4,t1_imf2pfp,"Then anyone can proceed to fork a chain per hour, send by email a wallet to each of them where they're the only ones having tokens, except two other wallets which will sell 2 gwei at $1k and define an astronomical price of the token. 

They're then forced to pay taxes on astronomical incomes and can't even sell to anyone afterwards because no one will want their useless copies.

After all, that's the exact rules you're describing. If the IRS enforces such rule at any point in time, let us know. They'll be instantly driven to bankruptcy for the rest of their life.",t3_x1nyv8
imf57sh,t1_imf2pfp,"The taxable event is when you sell.   


Otherwise, we can all play games with each other just airdropping locked coins and using liquidity pools to raise the trading price of the coins to millions of dollars each just to cause you to owe the IRS more money than you own.

Check it out for yourself, Q23: One of my cryptocurrencies went through a hard fork followed by an airdrop and I received new cryptocurrency. Do I have income?  
A23.  If a hard fork is followed by an airdrop and you receive new cryptocurrency, you will have taxable income in the taxable year you receive that cryptocurrency.  


I'm a CPA and in the US, there is no difference between a spam airdrop that you did not consent to receiving vs an airdrop you decided to receive. It is taxed as income at the value it's worth.  


For other countries, like the UK, they have specifically identified that spam airdrops are not taxed when received, only when sold.   


Feel free to disagree, but the IRS guidance is clear.",t3_x1nyv8
imf68jt,t1_imf4moh,"Hear ye, hear ye! All ETHW receivers, everyone try to purchase .001 ETHW as soon as it hits the exchanges for $500. If we can get that first transaction in, we can all declare losses on tax instead of capital gains up to $500,000 per coin.",t3_x1nyv8
imfih8f,t1_imf6c2i,">One of my cryptocurrencies went through a hard fork followed by an airdrop and I received new cryptocurrency. Do I have income?

Not the same scenario at all. Any future airdrop is very different from any token you're having at fork time. PoW ETH isn't an airdrop. An airdrop is a very specific technical event that exactly matches a transaction transferring tokens to lots of wallets. There's no such transaction in a fork. At all.",t3_x1nyv8
imfj5kp,t1_imf6c2i,"So what's your plan when I send you a airdrop, trade the coin up to a hundred million dollars and then pull the liquidity making it impossible to realize your gains? How about I lock the airdrop and then then make it unlockable only after the following tax year and after I pull all liquidity?

Airdrops are misunderstood and you could not possibly enforce guidelines that are near complete theft. I could easily bankrupt you off your interpretation of these guidelines. This would never fly.

Also:

""When you receive cryptocurrency from an airdrop following a hard fork, you will have ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the new cryptocurrency when it is received""

I can easily interpret this as $0.00 at the time of the deposit. I would then pay capital gains from $0.00 to the price point of the execution of my sell order. This is what would make the most sense. If your a CPA... be better.",t3_x1nyv8
imiri1y,t1_imfih8f,"airdrop following a fork is the terminology the IRS uses in regards to a fork. I understand an airdrop is completely different, but this is how the IRS describes the new addition of forked tokens available in your wallet.",t3_x1nyv8
