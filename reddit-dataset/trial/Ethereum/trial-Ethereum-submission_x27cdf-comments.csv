This is also good for decision making, since those large hubs have more interest to participate in the choice of roadmap for the whole project. Similar to a senate/house committee with thousands of members

balance transfers are no more complicated than many x86 instructions. there is zero reason why balance transfers aren't trivially parallelizable. the halting problem isn't a problem because balance transfers can be done in constant time. just run it twice if you have to

contracts are more complicated, but there's no fundamental reason it can't be done. even there, you don't have specific data showing that denial-of-service attacks are un-mitigateable when doing speculative multithreading on contracts. or any data at all, actually. and we already know with the gas limit that contracts can't run forever. which means technically they're not even turing complete. Ethereum even has a huge advantage over most systems in that it has contract code available ahead of time and can preprocess the shit out of it in a background thread. Or three or ten. Just constantly. thx for the block btw.

and that doesn't even get into actual sharding where users are explicitly made aware of what shard they're on and accept that cross-shard access comes with different guarantees. as for deadlock specifically, I imagine you can simply revert both transactions and take the gas they've consumed wasting your time.
