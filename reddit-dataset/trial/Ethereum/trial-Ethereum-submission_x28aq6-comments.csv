imi1j8r,t3_x28aq6,"Only Circle can ""burn"" USDC

Users can only transfer them to unrecoverable addresses",t3_x28aq6
imjgd1c,t3_x28aq6,"If you “burn” your own token, Circle will be happy now that they basically have your free dollar to keep forever because now you can’t redeem it with them. So I don’t see why they would issue another USDC to cover it.",t3_x28aq6
imi32vf,t3_x28aq6,I think if it's sent to a contract that has no capability to recover it then that's fine. Tether has done this in the past. Zeroing a user address though legal is probably not fair.,t3_x28aq6
imj5m5w,t3_x28aq6,"No, at least not in the US; they’re required by law to send the underlying collateral to OFAC / the treasury.",t3_x28aq6
imhz2ik,t3_x28aq6,Yes its legal,t3_x28aq6
imi2w76,t3_x28aq6,"It's interesting, because this ability of USDC also destroys a function of traditional tokens: when you send tokens to unrecoverable addresses, it's similar to burning them and to distribute marketcap value between remaining tokens.

That's how creating a new ability, by removing a constraint, also destroys some properties of the token.",t3_x28aq6
imidnpv,t3_x28aq6,"Well yeah, Circle can do what they want with USDC. 

But I think they'd be inclined to just let the USDC be unless it was an accident. Circle invests the USDC backing into various US Treasury securities so they're earning yield on the cash they hold, and that yield is *not* passed on to USDC holders.",t3_x28aq6
imiipwo,t3_x28aq6,"If it's possible to recover the coin, then have you really burned it?..",t3_x28aq6
imse5ol,t3_x28aq6,"If the USDC is so unstable, then what's the point of holding this coin",t3_x28aq6
imhyegd,t3_x28aq6,Why would someone burn usdc?,t3_x28aq6
imj8pr2,t3_x28aq6,"the company's policy sucks, and the fact that it does not conduct audit confirms that usdc is no longer reliable",t3_x28aq6
imj97zc,t1_imi1j8r,So not the technical burn function but sending it to the burn address.,t3_x28aq6
imkbjst,t1_imjgd1c,"I back this . It seems more likely that losing access to usdc works in circles favor since the usdc is still technically there , but now you can’t get your USD back",t3_x28aq6
imrkcbh,t1_imi32vf,"https://futurism.com/the-byte/crypto-dev-command-company

>...accidentally used a command that shutting the whole thing down in one fell swoop. That means over half a million dollars worth of USDC are now ""not recoverable at the moment of writing,"" according to the blog post. ""We immediately searched the relevant topic on Solana discord, and also asked a core dev from Solana,"" the post reads, ""but the answers we got are overwhelmingly indicating that we are unable to re-deploy our program to the previous program ID... anymore.""",t3_x28aq6
imi4w13,t1_imi2w76,"Ok, what exactly do you expect when burning a stablecoin? I mean in terms of value... should USDC be >$1 because people have burnt some? That totally doesn't make any sense, because Circle mints/burns these tokens all the time.",t3_x28aq6
imj8ys8,t1_imiipwo,"But then burning US currency is a crime too, so it wouldn't make sense to do the same to the currency that which has been done to the token.",t3_x28aq6
imj9mtt,t1_imj8pr2,I only used USDC as an example. I could have used USDP.,t3_x28aq6
iml5z7d,t1_imj97zc,"Any address is a ""burn"" address if you throw away access to the wallet after the transfer. Just lost in the ether never to be used by anyone else again.",t3_x28aq6
ims6re7,t1_imrkcbh,"What a coincidence. In this instance I don't see a problem with circle issuing fresh usdc, in fact I hope they do work to reimburse lost funds.",t3_x28aq6
imi5cnc,t1_imi4w13,"I didn't mean Circle shouldn't do that or anything. 

It was only interesting to see you could remove a fundamental property by adding an ability to the contract. It was more about tokenomics modeling analysis than anything. And certainly not a criticism of the token.",t3_x28aq6
imjjo8e,t1_imj8ys8,"Legality of burning cash is irrelevant here. If I burn a $20 bill, it is gone, legal or not.",t3_x28aq6
imlkfr8,t1_imj8ys8,"USDC is not US currency 

It is an IOU distributed by Circle. Based on how many US dollar (and bonds etc.) Circle has in their bank account.

If Circle burn their USDC, and making it less than how many USD in their account, it's their loss.. but they dont break any law doing it. 

If Circle mint their USDC, and making it more on than how many USD they own, they broke the law and US government will shut them down.

If users send USDC to unrecoverable address.. nothing happened. It will still count as USDC in circulation.
