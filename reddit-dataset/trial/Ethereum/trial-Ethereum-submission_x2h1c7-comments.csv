imjlr4j,t3_x2h1c7,"tldr; Myria has announced the release of Myria L2, a blockchain gaming-focused Ethereum (ETH) layer 2 (L2) scaling solution for enabling quick and safe trades as well as zero gas fees for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and blockchain gaming. The Myria Developer Solution adopts an API-first strategy, simplifying intricate blockchain interactions using Myria’s collection of REST APIs and software development kits.

imk2jfe,t3_x2h1c7,I feel web3 gaming space is so saturated with noise now. Every new project gathers so much hype because it incorporates NFTs. I have yet to see anything truly catching,t3_x2h1c7
imk217h,t3_x2h1c7,"What an amazing value offering. Crazy high TPS, little to no gas fees, and the carbon neutrality. Will be following this project moving forward. Great scalability for developers, as well as doing it's part towards by being neutral with its carbon omissions. Will be curious to see how developers will hop on this wagon.",t3_x2h1c7
iml4xmo,t3_x2h1c7,I have yet to see an actual game with an actual userbase incorporate blockchain tech. They're either glorified scavenger hunts like Decentraland and Sandbox or they're just NFT projects with a gamified UI system surrounding it. I sleep on this.,t3_x2h1c7
imn6h97,t3_x2h1c7,"Interesting, High TPS, little to no gas fees, SDK for developers and scalability. Polygon already offers developers all of these things and much more. If this keeps its promises then I think the competition will be healthy for Ethereum. With that being said I think Polygon already does what this promises and more, I'm wondering how this is going to set itself apart from other L2s.",t3_x2h1c7
imjvm3f,t3_x2h1c7,"I agree that partnerships are huge to bring more light to the space, especially with web3 gaming and sports. But partnering with 1 cricket player in South Africa doesn’t mean that this project has strong potential. But it’s a decent start",t3_x2h1c7
immogi4,t3_x2h1c7,"> 1.2 million verified registered users, has over 100 projects that are powered by Myria already before the introduction of its L2.

imnbcck,t3_x2h1c7,Enjin does this best 💪,t3_x2h1c7
imkfrim,t1_imk2jfe,"Woohoo, “in our game your character is also an NFT!” “Play our game!” I’ll stay waiting for an actual good game that gets developed in this space, and not a game that just uses web3 buzz words",t3_x2h1c7
iml0llc,t1_imk2jfe,"Very true, and its been gainig traction from VC lately, 2021 4B went into Gamefi, unfortunately the products arent worthy.",t3_x2h1c7
immgrio,t1_imk217h,Claimed carbon neutrality is almost always a scam.,t3_x2h1c7
imked4d,t1_imk217h,Smoke and mirrors. This could just look like a good project bc it’s so young. Let’s see how “high” their TPS is and how “low” their gas fees are when people actually start to develop on their layer. Its just fake hype imo,t3_x2h1c7
immbvwv,t1_iml4xmo,What are examples of the latter?,t3_x2h1c7
imm2lsu,t1_imjvm3f,"Rather than looking at sponsorships I'd say look more at their statistics and userbase. Million+ users shows good development even before the release of the solution, what do you think?",t3_x2h1c7
immlih7,t1_imked4d,"Yeah, classic startup bs of spending investor money to get clients and then failing when it’s discovered that their business plan is crap or nonexistent",t3_x2h1c7
imlsnlp,t1_imked4d,"Wouldn't say it's all smoke and mirrors. There's a ton of shit L2's out there but one with a niche stands out much more than others. I.e Myria targeting P2E, something other platforms have yet to do.",t3_x2h1c7
imqn8l4,t1_immbvwv,Cryptokitties and AxieInfinity.,t3_x2h1c7
imngpk5,t1_imlsnlp,">Myria targeting P2E, something other platforms have yet to do.

Targeting P2E or NFT gaming in general? Cause there are different technology involved in NFT gaming like _play-to-own_ tech that the Aloki games will be using, which is kinda different to the most popular _play-to-earn_ that most people know.

So will the Myria L2 solution be available for all NFT games or just the P2E games alone?",t3_x2h1c7
