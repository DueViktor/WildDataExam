imggke3,t3_x1tmeb,"To those who don't know yet and for perspective, Hayek is a well known Austrian economist who's long warned about the problems of currency being controlled by the state through monetary policies. 

He's notably criticized some Keynesian economy principles and the unfortunate, unintended consequences of the tragedy of the commons.

There are so many more on the list. Do not venerate this man, he and his disciples are terrible people. Friedman talks specifically about how suffering is required to make disciplined workers.

Hayek, 1984

And on that note, Frédéric Bastiat predated him

""When plunder becomes a way of life for a group of men living together in society, they create for themselves in the course of time a legal system that authorizes it and a moral code that glorifies it."" Frederic Bastiat, 1847

And since we are quoting left and right, 1988 Cryptoanarchist manifesto about NFTs.

""Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government  interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures.”

And 1992, Cypherpunk manifesto:

- ""Privacy is the power to selectively reveal 
oneself to the world.""
- ""We must defend our own privacy if we 
expect to have any.""
- ""We cannot expect governments, 
corporations or other large, faceless 
organizations to grant us privacy out of 
their benificence.""
- ""We are defending our privacy with 
cryptography, with anonymous 
mail-forwarding systems, with digital 
signatures, and with electronic money.""
- ""Our code is free for all to use, worldwide.
We don’t much care if you don’t approve of the software we write. We know that software can’t be destroyed and that a widely dispersed system can’t be 
shutdown.""",t3_x1tmeb

imfuxeu,t1_imft80x,"The Ethereum documentation itself describes how the UASF works as a defense against a consensus attack. 

As for Bitcoin, it's pretty simple: PoW has economies of scale ensuring big mining farms are incentivized. That's because consensus voting power comes from production of hashes. And production of hashes is sensible to economies of scale, be it in electricity prices or in mining equipment prices. 

Yet, any big enough electricity consumption is easy to spot on an electrical grid. That's how big mining farms are easy to spot and coerce by any coercive enough group, notably a state. That's notably how China could enforce its ban of PoW mining, for instance. That's also how England could spot and stop miners who illegally used big quantities of electricity in an abandoned warehouse to mine tokens (in or near London, if I remember well enough). States have shown they've learnt about it, already. 

This ensures states can control a majority of the consensus power in any PoW network, if they want to, which allows states to perform a consensus attack. Yet, there is no known way to solve a consensus attack*. At equal funds, it's always easier for the attacker to attack the chain than for anyone else to defend it, specifically due to economies of scale, aka cheap big consensus actors, and cheap coercion of big consensus actors.

Even any fork can't prevent the attacker from following the fork, since there's no reason to believe the attacker has any mining profile different from anyone else in terms of ASICs usage and they already have lots of funds from their attack due to earning 100% of the reward by spending only 51% of the mining and electricity cost, while everyone else earns exactly 0% of the reward for 49% of the cost.

[Ethereum already has identical distribution to BTC.](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). There is literally nothing to lose by moving to a better consensus algorithm. I'm not reading your bitcoin bible for obvious reasons, but I imagine the key argument is that if a money is printed out of thin air, it cannot be credibly neutral - the thing is though, we are **years** past this point, distribution is over, and now Ether inflates less too, meaning it is draining much less value than Bitcoin is, while also having a myriad of other metrics driving value to it. This is in sharp contrast to Bitcoin which is practically speaking an unused/low demand money backed only by flimsy/vague narratives (that apply just as much to Ethereum really, not that I think Ethereum needs them).

POW is literally just a mechanism to coerce people to agree on which block is correct - this can be done without ridiculous amount of waste by having something at stake. **There's nothing magically bad about it, no matter how much you repeat it to yourselves.**

>PoW to PoS is a dangerous move.

Not even a little bit, but since you are \*forced\* to stick to POW, you have to justify it - it's actually really tragic to watch, because it doesn't take very much effort to realize how superior POS is.

>When you deregulate the financial sector you create worse inequality.

Wrong. When you regulate a business activity, you create worse inequalities. That's because you increase the barrier of entry cost of new competitors, securing a competitive advantage to big, already existing competitors, called corporations. The very corporations you dislike and Hayek dislikes. But sure, go ahead.

>And when you do have workers in unions, with co-determination, and more power inequality decreases which is parts of keynesianism that he explicitly ignored.

Quote where Keynesianism talks about having unions. It has nothing to do together. People form unions however they want. The problem starts when unions are forced interactions rather than free associations. As long as workers aren't forced to be part of a union, there's no problem with it.

>So yes there are ways to limit inequality and one of those ways is to limit the market.

Completely false. This is just a way to redistribute inequality to benefit the people in power. You've been majorly scammed. 

>. Is it consented if Pinochet privatized everything and now you need to work for a monopoly who has more power than you do?

If privatization has been made by stealing to everyone, where was it consented to begin with, exactly? Technically, a king seizing land is privatization too. Try again.

Deregulation can't create monopolies. It's the other way around. It's outstanding you can't believe literally the very opposite of reality. Gravity does down, not up.

That is a claim, not an argument. Prove your claim. 

In practice, it can't hurt the trust of the network and its participants, since it's participants themselves who conduct such fork to protect the chain against an attack. 

To conduct such attack, the attacker would need to buy so many tokens it would drive the price of the tokens extremely high. And it would need many months of waiting queue of its validators. Don't think it's a small operation they can trivially do anytime they wish. 

>you'd be left with an even smaller PoS network that gets easier and easier to 51% attack through money printing with every UASF

Completely false. There are just as many honest validators after the fork than before the fork, so the chain is just as secured in terms of number of validators. And in terms of quantity of funds required, you'd have just as many tokens left to buy. That's because, every time you fork away tokens, it's even more tokens that can't be bought and used to attack the chain. 

The attack itself would require to increase token price so much it would become even more difficult afterwards to attack the chain, even if not taking into account the lesser quantity of tokens. 

Besides, even the first attack would he an astronomical cost. The second would be even bigger.

And there's a point beyond which 50% of the tokens are used in validation by honest validators, point beyond which it becomes literally impossible to attack the chain anymore.

Though, you can't deny the fact that, at some point in these attacks, the chain becomes completely invulnerable to any such threat, due to 51% of the tokens being managed by honest validators the state wouldn't even be able to coerce. At this point, there's just no more way to buy enough tokens to attack the chain at all.

Not to double spend, to control the network, just the same as in PoS consensus attack attempts. It's the cheapest way of controlling the chain, and that cheapest way is easily doable with PoW. 

Besides, it's not hard to spot big mining farms at all. You just have to look at your electrical grid and that's it. Big electricity consumption are easy to spot. It's way harder to find validators once they know you're looking for them. The ones beforehand will have doxxed themselves, sure. But son't expect them not to be anonymous afterwards. They'll just use whatever they need to keep being anonymous. Chain analysis only works on people who don't know how to protect their data. 

And you really don't need the military to enforce laws onto people. Just some police officers are enough, just like in England. Unless we're taking about miners turning into mafia or such, but I wouldn't be expecting that. 

>Realistically, any drastic attack on any network can be hard forked for repair, but it's never ideal.

No, a consensus attack on a PoW chain can't be hard forked for repair. Attackers can follow you, because you can't destroy their mining equipment. That's the very problem of PoW, besides economies of scale. 

>But thinking that Ethereum is money is pretty ridiculous. It's pretty clear in the white paper that it is an application platform and never claims to be a monetary system.

It is an asset that can be used as money, just like any other asset. Just like gold. It just happens to be much easier to store, verify and transfer than gold, aka having much better properties. So, yeah, it has been designed as an asset. It can still be used as money.

Work in itself never brings value. That's the dirt pie fallacy. 

Rather, value comes from features. A secured payment processing is a feature. 

Producing lots of hashes in PoW only serves to distribute consensus voting power, while the consensus itself brings the payment processing. If you can replace that with anything that isn't as expensive, it's called an improvement. Just as much as a coal power plant suddenly consuming 100 times less coal to produce the same quantity of energy.

Because people who have millions didn't have it from thin air. They know how to make money and they rarely start a business which won't be flourishing. That is why they have millions in the first place. **If bitcoin mining wouldn't be profitable there would be no bitcoin for a decade now.**

Halvings **AND PoW issuance** affecting the price. I cannot go into more detail and cannot describe it more better than this, this is my last example which I'm willing to provide:  


# If you put a million dollar into a bitcoin mining farm you don't want to get out from that business with less than a million. Right? 

# You don't want to make a loss, you want to make profit. Thus you will hold your mined bitcoins until it is worth to sell. This is about making money, right?

# Thus means your mined bitcoins have a theoretical price limit of a million dollars in your head, because that was your initial investing money, thus you won't sell until those bitcoins worth at least a million dollars not just theoretically but in the real market. 

# Because you want to cover your investment and you would also like to make profit on top of that, right? Remember, you started mining to have a profit!

# Thus the work (your hard earned money invested into the farm, your time, energy, effort, brain work) goes into the value of bitcoin, raising its price!

&#x200B;

And in the top of that we have the halvings and finite amount which put the cherry to the top of the cake. If you disagree with this example I cannot continue the debate, I cannot describe it better and I think this right.  


This is PoW. People putting inside time, energy, effort, money and brain work into a business.

That's Bitcoin. Except that there are users who want to buy Bitcoin, at the price they want as a whole. That's what matters: users, who compete between each others to buy products. Miners don't dictate the price at all. It's only availability of the products and of the demand, nothing else.

As a proof, it's Bitcoin's price that dictates how many miners will mine the tokens, not the other way around. You don't see miners increasing the mining difficulty inconsequently and price following them. No. You see price increasing and miners following until price doesn't increase anymore and, suddenly, miners stop increasing mining difficulty. Did they decide price was enough? No. They didn't decide anything. Users decided.

And when Bitcoin's price decreases, is it that miners finally consider the price is too high and that they want to stop mining? No. They didn't decide anything. Users decided. And miners followed by mining less as a result.

>And it is getting harder and harder with every 4 years. In my opinion this is THE main and important thing.

What you're seeing is a temporarily somewhat constant demand that is suddenly met with a halvening of newly available tokens. This is what drives prices higher, because demand is suddenly met with a halved offer. It has nothing to do with the effort miners put in it, as has already been shown above.

Completely false statement, just a claim, not an argument. Prove your claims.

Let's show one example to completely stop that false reasoning. I have a natural well, it's full of a liquid no one wants. It smells and it's dirty. But I'm lazy, so I keep it that way. One day, people discover a liquid that can be burnt and that is very useful for lots of applications, as it can release energy. It's oil. And I realize that the liquid I have in my well is that same liquid, oil. I've got nothing to do to get it, it's already there. In large quantities. But other people have a hard time finding even small quantities of it. They've just discovered it and are trying to see how they could extract it from under the earth through lots of machinery. In the meantime, I can just sell mine at a high price, because it has a lot of value for lots of application.

Value comes from use cases, from applications, from people desiring something. Not from work. Work only and solely defines if a trade can be made: if the cost of work is lower than value, then a trade can be made, a business can exist. Otherwise, it doesn't exist, because it wouldn't be profitable in the first place.

>Read the Bitcoin standard book. The first chapter is not even about Bitcoin or Cryptocurrencies. It is about how humanity created money. It is clearly stated in that chapter that every empire collapsed who changed their money minting method from a work based one into a printing based one. 

Stated claims is not something I'm interested in. I'm interested in supporting evidence. Mere correlation of a few occurrences isn't any case of causation. You're just lacking the skepticism to realize you've been scammed by a book. Many books are scams. Anyone can write a book. Beware.

This is becoming ridiculous, so I'll let go of the unnecessary parts: saying things need work to have value is a thing. Good. Ok. But it's irrelevant anyway, because being a consensus actor still is a work in itself and because you're still not proving that work decides about value, in any way. 

>There is no free value. Value equals work.

There is. Breathing air is free value. Remembering your memories is free value. Smiling is free value. So many things you've been accustomed to consider both free and worthless, but that would deeply lack you if you didn't have them. They're not requiring any work, but they're full of value. How much would you give to breath if you couldn't? How much would you give to remember your memories if you couldn't? 

You're just confusing value with market price and thinking of its relation to cost completely backwards. It's why you're having so many misconceptions about money and how it works. 

>Creating money (value) out of thin air is a fairy tale created by the cryptocurrency scene.

It's not out of thin air at all. Value comes from people. In fact, value can't exist outside of people, because value is inherent to people themselves: it is subjective. Value is whatever people desire. Literally. Because value is what you'd be ready to give up in exchange of something.

You're talking about them trying to take control of a chain, they'd just have to say the chain has to be controlled by them and anyone who's in control of mining equipment should hand it over to the state. Anyone who doesn't comply has its equipment seized and considered criminal, because it's the law. Plain and simple. It's the state we're talking about. They are the ones defining the law. The state is the legal implication itself. 

It wouldn't even be the first time states would do such a thing, by the way. We had it with gold, already, after all.

>You're talking killing people and blatant government crimes here.

Quote me saying the state would kill anyone that complies with the law. 

>And it assumes that every single instance somehow works and everyone being coerced agrees to help.

No, it doesn't need to assume that in any way.

>Does it seem like you're kinda just spinning up a scenario that can't plausibly happen?

It seems not, but I'm ready to let you tell me what prevents it. A Constitution? A judge? A god? A weapon? What makes it implausible, exactly?",t3_x1tmeb
imuwmfs,t1_imu6nzx,">This is a HUGE CONTRADICTION.

>How are they not driving the price if they are literally the ONLY ONES who can decide the fate of the newly born Bitcoins? Are you familiar with how markets work? Supply and demand?

No it's not a contradiction. You can't force a sell. And buyers aren't forced to buy. But sellers are forced to sell if they want to have profit, which means they're actually forced not to mine if they can't make a profit when selling. That's why miners have no choice. That's why they drive nothing. They only follow the demand, nothing else. 

In supply and demand, there is supply, but there also is demand. Did you notice that? You can't sell to people at your price if they don't accept your price. Besides, supply isn't miners themselves. Supply is the issuance. Miners only are the sellers.

So, users indeed want to buy. At a given price, not at any price sellers want.

>It is not about tokenomics, it is about the resources and effort pumped into creating Bitcoins.

No, scarcity is about tokenomics and only tokenomics, nothing else. The cost of mining only ensures miners are self-regulated so that there aren't more miners than it's profitable. Not the other way around.

>If you have a ""tokenomics"" fruit tree in your garden which yields you 100 fruits in the first year then 50 then 25 then 12 then 6 etc and you have the same tree in a distant island which you can only acquire by travelling there, bringing there water, take care of it, etc, so PUTTING WORK IN IT, which tree's fruit will be more valuable?

It's the same tree, so it gives the same resource, so it's sold at the same price. How can't you see that? It means the closest tree will be more profitable to use than the other one, which means everyone will want to own and use the closer tree.

So, if there's not enough demand for fruits, only the fruits from the closest tree will be sold. And if there's enough demand for fruits and the desire for fruits is enough to have a high enough price to cover for the cost of the other tree, then fruit price will be higher, for the two trees, being just slightly lower for the closest tree in order to sell all fruits from the closest tree. 

This means the closest tree either is the only one selling any fruit and being any profitable or is the one constantly selling all fruits and selling them at a way higher price than cost, aka with an incredible profitability compared to the other tree. 

>You think scarcity is enough to make something valuable and for some degree it is. But Bitcoin's magic is the scarcity AND work put into it.

Work only adds a higher cost, which necessarily means it can only be sold at a higher price even if it's not desired at such price, which means it's not sold at all if it's not desired at such price. You're thinking about it completely backwards.",t3_x1tmeb
imuwvcm,t1_imu6nzx,">No. You can sell yours on a high price because it has lots of applications (useful, just as I said) AND hard to obtain. People digging the earth JUST AS YOU SAID IN YOUR example.

Yes? Then tell me the procedure how will you climb down to the well, how will you put the oil into some containers, what tools will you use, how will you climb up from the well? What clothes will you wear? From where you get the clothes the tools and machinery? How do you know the proper tools, clothes, equipment and machinery? Will use your bare hands to gather oil? How much hours and days and weeks you have to put into this job until you can acquire a sum which you can sell? Where will you store it? Do you know anything about oil storage? Do you have to read in the given topic? How much books have you read before you start such profession? What if people will get know about your natural oil reservoir, how will you protect it? What fences would you build? Can you build such fence? Will you ask somebody else to do it for you? How much that will cost? How do you know that your well has plenty of oil? How can you determine if is your new business is lucrative in the long run? Will you pay for a professional to have that measure for you? Will you do all this work alone or will you pay for other workers? How much will that cost? What if somebody gets hurt? Do you know the proper law in such scenarios? Will you be the one who blame? You literally know nothing about oil mining and have zero experience in it, is it really ""isn't hard to obtain at all"" as you phrased?  


Your example is to put it mildly, naive.  


>Already answered. Breathing, remembering your memories and all.

Cool. Now get back to the material world which we are speaking of.

Yes, but PoS's input work is so tiny **like breathing**. That is why it wouldn't add value into such coin, not like PoW which is a heavy work which gets harder in every four years.

You're doing a terrible job at defending your position, really. At this point, I could let you write all alone: you're providing all the counter arguments.

>That is why it wouldn't add value into such coin, not like PoW which is a heavy work which gets harder in every four years.

The fact you take way less cost to provide the service isn't at all a reason to pretend the service is less valuable. It's just as valuable, just like a coal power plant that consumes 100 times less coal for the same energy output. It is 100 times more efficient, literally.

Not an argument, just a claim. Do you have anything to support that claim?

inkcxud,t1_ink7aji,"Value isn't at all the definition of the product of work. Value is what sentient beings attribute to products or services for the use cases they provide for.

At this point, still asking if there's anything of value that comes out of work could just be turned into that question: given your definition of work, is there anything at all, with or without value, that can come without work?

The complete opposite of what? Work costs you, sure, but you've contrived everything to be a cost anyway. Even remembering has become a cost to you. At some point, what isn't a cost to you, exactly? What isn't work? What is it that you do that you've not designated, by definition, as something that costs you?
