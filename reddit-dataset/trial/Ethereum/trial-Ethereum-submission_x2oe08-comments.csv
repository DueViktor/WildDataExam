imktdy1,t3_x2oe08,"The current Ethereum chain is going to turn into the new proof of stake chain. There might also be the proof of work chain running separately, but most exchanges and stablecoins won't recognize it as Ethereum anymore.

As a user, your experience should be seamless and your eth and coins will remain safe.",t3_x2oe08
imknozq,t3_x2oe08,You will get copies of all your tokens for each separate chain but stables will only be redeemable on the PoS chain and be worthless on pow chains.,t3_x2oe08
immoux8,t3_x2oe08,"If you are interested, you can also use this article. It's about how exactly Ethereum and Ethereum 2.0 work. https://www.cryptologi.st/news/ethereum-20-all-you-need-to-know?utm\_source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cryptologi.st%2F&utm\_campaign=reddit&utm\_id=reddit",t3_x2oe08
imkts9g,t1_imktdy1,"So we will get a new set of stables ,if we hold stables, immediately?",t3_x2oe08
imkose8,t1_imknozq,But i will still get pos copies of stables the same day the merge happens?,t3_x2oe08
imkuthi,t1_imkts9g,"The old set will be worth nothing, though. But you will seamlessly access the new one instead of the old one, so it's inconsequential to the user anyway.",t3_x2oe08
imkunw6,t1_imkts9g,Yes. You shouldn't notice any interruption.,t3_x2oe08
imlmlwc,t1_imkose8,"Only one of the stables will be worth anything. Just because the tokens double doesn't mean that the currency backing them doubles. So one set of stables will be worth zero, the ones on any PoW fork, and the one on the PoS fork will be worth what they are pegged to.",t3_x2oe08
imlngcq,t1_imkose8,"Yes nothing is going to change. Merge will come and go and the user experience doesn't change at all, just there will be at least one pow chain where most assets beside eth are worthless",t3_x2oe08
imktsgl,t1_imkose8,"It's the whole network state that is copied. So, you will have everything you already have, once, in each different network. And you will have access to all these networks.

This is supposing you're actually the one owning these tokens in your own self-hosted wallet, not in a centralized platform. 

If it's on a centralized platform, it's the platform who receives all these tokens. And it's up to the platform to decide whether to keep the tokens or to support all branches to provide these tokens to you.",t3_x2oe08
immd6kd,t1_imktsgl,"if its a different network, then the new tokens will not go into my eth adress then ? Doesnt the new network have its own eth adresses or do we keep the same ?  


Also for example if i have 1000 usdc(old) in my wallet, will i automatically get 1000 usdc(new) without doing anything right ?",t3_x2oe08
immeakt,t1_immd6kd,"You have the same wallet address, with the same private key, in each of these networks. Automatically. 

Think of it as a city. You have a private key to a house in that city, that you can locate with your wallet address. In that house, you have objects you call tokens. 

Then, the city is forked, duplicating everything, including your house, into two cities instead of one.

Now, there are two cities. And your private key can open two different houses. Each of them has the same wallet address, but in a different city. And each of them has the same objects you had beforehand.

Except that there are these stablecoin tokens in both houses: only the tokens in one of these houses will be recognized by the centralized entity backing them, the ones of City X. Those of City Xbis won't have any value because that centralized entity doesn't back them and won't pay back anyone who'd want to redeem its value for USD.

Well, at least, that's for USDC and USDT. For more decentralized stablecoins, it will be less clear, as it can also be backed by others tokens. But don't expect much of it all anyway.",t3_x2oe08
immhztr,t1_immeakt,thx a lot,t3_x2oe08
immi4p5,t1_immeakt,They are not paying you enough Perleflamme! How do you find the time?,t3_x2oe08
immi9jk,t1_immhztr,You welcome. ^ ^,t3_x2oe08
immsrry,t1_immi4p5,"It's the benefit of being efficient. I have my spare time and I have my work time. And I sleep in several phases, too. That helps.",t3_x2oe08
