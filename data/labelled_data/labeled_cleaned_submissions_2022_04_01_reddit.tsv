### 4. Dealing with 51% Attacks

* **How does PoW vs PoS recover from 51% attacks?**

#### PoW

With PoW, once someone amasses 51% of the hashpower, there’s no mechanism to prevent them from continuously and endlessly attacking the chain. This is what has been dubbed a[ Spawn-Camp Attack](https://dyor-crypto.fandom.com/wiki/Spawn_Camping_Attack); an attacker can 51% attack the chain over and over again with the explicit goal of rendering it useless. 

Under a 51% attack scenario, if honest miners cannot source additional hashpower then the attacker has full control over the transaction inclusion.  

The hashpower that secures Bitcoin is **produced externally from the network.** ASIC’s aren’t ‘registered’ to Bitcoin in the same way that ETH is to Ethereum. 

#### PoS

ETH is a virtual ASIC. Digital ASICs have some important advantages: 

* **ETH doesn’t decay; it** ***strengthens.***   

   * *PoW-ers claim that this creates structural centralization, due to how validators on Day 1 are basically guaranteed to still be validators on Day 10,000, whereas miners are constantly churning due to the required investment in hardware, facilities, and operational costs.* 
   * *PoS-ers claim that this empowers the individual better, as the challenges of maintaining hashpower market share are only accessible to those with privileged knowledge, political connections, and large amounts of capital. PoS takes all these challenges, and contains them inside of the value of ETH, democratizing the upside of those benefits to those who are capable of simply holding and staking ETH.* 
* **ETH is infinity transportable, maximally discrete, and has no physical footprint**  

   * *Staked ETH doesn’t actually exist anywhere in the real world. This makes the PoS network far more resilient to attack. PoW mining facilities are subject to physical forces (armies, governments, tanks) and cannot easily uproot themselves. The physical cumbersome nature of PoW facilities makes it susceptible to capture, just like how gold was ultimately captured by nation-states.*
* **Most importantly, ETH is known to Ethereum**  

   * *Unlike ASICs, ETH is registered to the Ethereum network. The Ethereum network can identify between malicious vs honest stakers.*

In a PoS attack, the attack is coming from a **specific address** that holds **specific ETH** that is being used to attack the network. The supply of staked ETH that would attack Ethereum is objectively viewable to everyone.

*“The 15M staked-ETH at address 0xabc123attackeraddress789xyz proposed an invalid block, attempting to fork the network”*

There are two possible scenarios here:

1. A staker produces an invalid block. The protocol can objectively view this invalid block, and slashes the staker who proposed it. No human intervention is required. 
2. An attacker has &gt;66% of the stake, and is able to prevent #1 from occurring. This allows the staker to censor all transactions.

In the dire circumstance of #2, PoS gives the system the capacity to fork into a new chain while deleting the stake of the attacker. The community identifies validators controlled by the attacker, and comes to a consensus about if and how to remove these validators from the active set, either by forcibly exiting them from staking, or even by removing these validators completely from the system, effectively burning the stake

Once this fork occurs, a significant amount of ETH is deleted from the network, making the proportion of ETH stake that is owned by honest, chain-aligned actors grow significantly. The ETH supply also goes down significantly, and everyone who *didn’t* attack the chain owns a larger share of the supply of ETH. It organically rewards those who were aligned with the network, while also increasing the costs for follow-up attacks, as the threshold for an attack is now a larger percentage of total supply. It’s really quite elegant. 

This process isn’t a formal part of the Ethereum network (*and may never even happen in practice, given the deterrence effects of the threat of a soft-fork*). This requires human intervention and off-chain coordination to pull off; something that is generally against the ethos of cryptocurrency. **The goal is to not have to fork.** But, in contrast, **Bitcoin doesn’t even have this option.** In a PoW 51% attack, human intervention is also required to get the network to resume normal operation, but unlike in PoS, there’s no clear and obvious path towards getting honest hashpower back above 51%. 

Both PoW and PoS result in external network actions in order to restore network consensus. 

#### PoS: 

1. Identify the address(es) of the attacker (*trivial; just look on-chain*). 
2. Coordinate a block height to fork off the attackers stake (*Non-trivial, but fork coordination has happened plenty of times in Ethereum’s history, and is a known quantity. We’ve done it before).* 

#### PoW

1. Coordinate with ASIC manufacturers and supply chains to ramp up ASIC production ASAP. 
2. Once the ASICs are produced, ship the ASICs to mining facilities that have the resource capacity for them
3. Ensure that these new ASICs aren’t actually shipped to the miner doing the attacking (*but you don’t know who it is!)*

The timeline for fixing a PoW 51% spawn-camp attack is *long.* It’s impossible to say how long without knowing the nature of the attack and the resources of the attacker, but I think it’s fair to claim that it's easier to coordinate on a blockheight to fork a PoS network than it is to coordinate global supply chains to ship ASICs to specifically the hands of honest actors. 

Not only is the PoW solution to a 51% attack a long process, but it also doesn’t produce any assurances that the solution will actually work. “Just produce more ASICs” is NOT a solution to a PoW 51% attack.

However, even more critically, #1 isn’t actually meaningfully incentivized by the network. Will miners actually take the risk of deploying capital to purchase ASICs while the chain is suffering a 51% attack? **What if the BTC price is plummeting as a result of the loss of confidence in the chain?** Will the miners actually receive the maximum ROI from the ASICs they need to purchase? Why take the risk? There are no guarantees that the network will ever come back online, seriously threatening the legitimacy of BTC the asset. If this causes BTC to fall in price, this removes even more incentive for honest miners to take the risk of investing more capital in producing honest hashpower. 

**Most importantly,** this shows how control over a PoW chain comes down to **who controls ASIC production and supply chains.** Because of its relationship with electricity consumption, PoW chains have a commitment to how the atoms of the physical world are organized. Whoever controls the physical world controls the PoW chain. 

**This is the bargain that PoW makes; by being instantiated in the physical world, it cedes control to those who control the physical world.** 

Yes, Bitcoin mining facilities are spread out over the world, but this is in contrast to Proof of Stake validators **which have no physical footprint.** The ETH that is staked to the Ethereum network doesn’t actually exist on any one specific computer. The validating computer that is staking ETH can be destroyed, and the staked ETH can be recovered and redeployed from private keys anywhere in the world.

This is one of the many reasons why Proof of Stake is more decentralized than Proof of Work; no supply chain centralization, no economies of scale centralization, and no large mining facility centralization.

I just noticed that BTC has finished 8 green candles in a row. You don't see that too often, so I was curious when it happened last, and how rare it really is. So I looked into it.

In the past 10 years, BTC had (at least) 8 consecutive green days in a row only 16 times, most of them in the very early days. 7 of those were in 2012, 2 in 2013, 2 in 2015, and once each each year from 2016 to 2021, except 2018. The longest streak ever was in 2012 (15 days), after 2012 the longest streak was 10 days (happened twice, once in 2013 and once only last year, in July 2021).

That means that BTC only needs two more green candles to tie the record for after 2012- and one more to break it. As I am writing this, the daily candle is slightly green again, but it's very close. Let's hope for green days all week, let's make this the longest streak in 10 years!"	True	False	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	4043479	public	self	Bitcoin has finished 8 green candles in a row.

This is purely speculation!

So I have listened to Multiple crypto influencers over the past few years. Some I've kept my subscription with and others I have got rid of due to them over time showing that they just go for hype or shill too much. This has left me with a group of channels that I trust enough to keep watching. 

Now most of the time they tend to cover the same news and events and TA. However occasionally they will pick up on a bit of something that the others don't. There have been a few rare occasions when those tid bits of info seem to point to something bigger. 

Ok..... so...... here goes. These are my findings 😄 

1.) On one podcast I saw about a month ago Jack Mallers was talking about how he got Facebook to change their thinking about crypto and using the lightning network. During this chat he mentioned that he was in talks with someone else and it was big but he couldn't say anything more about it. What is bigger than Facebook? This obviously perked my ears but at the time I couldn't find anything else related to shed some light on what he meant. 

2.) The BTC conference. There has been murmurs of a massive announcement that is bigger than the El Salvador news.what could be bigger than that? Now alot of people have guessed that it's another country or something along those lines. If it is that's awesome but it might be something else. 

3.) There have been a few recent leaks apparently from apple of bitcoin symbols they are going to use for something. 

4.) There have been a couple of tweets from Jack Mallers that have been a bit cryptic. One where he is in front of a chase bank atm but if you look he's wearing an Apple hat. Then another where he posted an Apple video about thinking differently. 

So..........

I deduct 🤣 that the announcement at the BTC conference might be that Apple start to use the lightning network in some form. Even better that they might announce they have brought some btc for their reserves.

When talking about paper wallets, most people say that they aren't safe because if you want to look up how many coins are stored in the wallet, you would have to rely on a third party service and trust them with that.
But isn't this also true for hot wallets or other cold wallets like Tresor? As long as I'm not running my own node I'd always have to trust third parties right?

And if some form of software indeed is safer in that regard, couldn't I just import my paper wallet and solve the issue that way?

Apologies for the non Americans, but I'm going to use FreeDumb units here until the end. 

First, we need to know how many ounces of gold are under human control. 

There is an estimated 200,000 metric tons of above ground (mined) gold in the world. https://www.visualcapitalist.com/chart-how-much-gold-is-in-the-world/ It's quite hard to know exactly, but lets assume that's correct. That's 7,054,800,000 ounces of gold. 

Now, since both gold and bitcoin are increasing in available supply through mining, we'll use the current number of mined bitcoins for the comparison, just about 19,000,000 bitcoin. 

7,054,800,000 ounce of gold / 19,000,000 bitcoin = 371 ounces of gold per bitcoin. 

371 ounces of gold at the current market rate of $1,950 per ounce is $723,450 of gold, vs the current market rate of bitcoin of $46,000. 

371 ounces of gold is approximately 23 pounds (10 kg). That's 371 gold coins that are a bit bigger and a lot heavier than an American dollar coin. One bitcoin weighs nothing. You can carry it with you in your brain with a memorized private key. 

And in reality, it's more dramatic than this, because of how much bitcoin is permanently lost. 

And of course, it's going to get increasingly worse in the future as bitcoin's inflation rate keeps halving towards zero while gold maintains a solid 2% per year, doubling the total supply every 35 years. That means that in order to keep your equivalent share of gold, you would need to increase your stack from 371 ounces today to 742 ounces in 35 years. The total supply of bitcoin is capped at 21,000,000. 

Why did I get go through all this? To illustrate just how incredibly precious even a single bitcoin is in the grand scheme of things. A single bitcoin is a massive share in the asset. If you can manage to acquire ownership of a whole coin, realize that you're holding the equivalent of 23lbs/10kg of gold, and value it accordingly."	False	False	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	4045443	public	self	Mental exercise; how much gold would you need to own to be equivalent to one bitcoin?	0	[]	1.0	https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/tt6mvf/mental_exercise_how_much_gold_would_you_need_to/	all_ads	6																						"Mental exercise; how much gold would you need to own to be equivalent to one bitcoin?
In this exercise, we're going to figure out how many lbs/kg of gold you would need to own to have the equivalent share of the total supply of gold as you would have with one bitcoin of the total supply of bitcoin. Apologies for the non Americans, but I'm going to use FreeDumb units here until the end. 

First, we need to know how many ounces of gold are under human control. 

There is an estimated 200,000 metric tons of above ground (mined) gold in the world. https://www.visualcapitalist.com/chart-how-much-gold-is-in-the-world/ It's quite hard to know exactly, but lets assume that's correct. That's 7,054,800,000 ounces of gold. 

Now, since both gold and bitcoin are increasing in available supply through mining, we'll use the current number of mined bitcoins for the comparison, just about 19,000,000 bitcoin. 

7,054,800,000 ounce of gold / 19,000,000 bitcoin = 371 ounces of gold per bitcoin. 

371 ounces of gold at the current market rate of $1,950 per ounce is $723,450 of gold, vs the current market rate of bitcoin of $46,000. 

371 ounces of gold is approximately 23 pounds (10 kg). That's 371 gold coins that are a bit bigger and a lot heavier than an American dollar coin. One bitcoin weighs nothing. You can carry it with you in your brain with a memorized private key. 

And in reality, it's more dramatic than this, because of how much bitcoin is permanently lost. 

And of course, it's going to get increasingly worse in the future as bitcoin's inflation rate keeps halving towards zero while gold maintains a solid 2% per year, doubling the total supply every 35 years. That means that in order to keep your equivalent share of gold, you would need to increase your stack from 371 ounces today to 742 ounces in 35 years. The total supply of bitcoin is capped at 21,000,000. 

Why did I get go through all this? To illustrate just how incredibly precious even a single bitcoin is in the grand scheme of things. A single bitcoin is a massive share in the asset. If you can manage to acquire ownership of a whole coin, realize that you're holding the equivalent of 23lbs/10kg of gold, and value it accordingly."

The University of Nottingham, UK have just announced their ground breaking new technology called ""CBI"" the Crypto Brain Interface, which enables the human mind to mine popular crypto blockchains using only the power of thought.

“As we all know the human brain is vastly superior in computational output to any computer we have today… We do this by scanning someone’s brain using Magnetoencephalography, or MEG and interfacing that with our Blockchain code. 

The team hope to refine the process in the coming years, by linking several human brains together in what would become the first human neutral-network, called “The Hub”. They hope to achieve this neural binding technology by 2023, linking 1000 people together by which time their collective hash rate will exceed 36500 Th/s

“Our graduate team are proud to announce today our findings.

Users post their feedback on Discord communities and Twitter but any meaningful input gets lost in the noise. This leads to frustration among users like us and loss of trust in crypto and web3 in general !!

So, I have been working on a feedback-to-earn platform where users like us can voice their product opinions, share feedback &amp; pain-points to help shape the product roadmaps, and earn in the process! There will be a mechanism for company representative (product teams) to listen to the feedback, respond, and share product roadmap. Will you use a platform like that?

If you like the idea please, please show your support by 1/ upvoting the post, and 2/ commenting below with your feedback/ feature requests/ improvement suggestions for your favorite web3 projects (any project - dev tools, defi, exchanges, marketplaces, etc.). 

If this post receives more than 50 responses, I will build an analysis and take it to the top reviewed products. This is help me make a case that the public has spoken and they need to be heard! :) **Also, staying true to the idea, I will give up to $50 to the top 5 most upvoted responses.**

Bonus points for following the below template, making the pain-point heartfelt, and avoiding duplication :)

**Product name:** *e.g. Metamask*

**Pain-point:** *e.g. Currently there is no way to interact with dApps on mobile using hardware wallets. I dont want to save my privatekeys in a hot wallet connected to the internet. Now I need to buy a new MacBook Air just to put my ledger in contract mode in the browser.*

**Potential solution/ feature request \[optional\]:** *e.g. Add support for Ledger Nano X.*

OBFC provides a standard protocol to perform a SWIFT/Fed based wire transfer using stablecoins on Ethereum, by simply interacting with a smart-contract, rather than a traditional custodian or escrow service.

No more passwords, phone verifications or emails, OBFC requires only one authorized on-chain transaction to initiate real-time wire transfers to bank accounts almost anywhere in the world.

The protocol allows individuals to send digital dollars directly from individually owned and controlled Ethereum accounts to bank accounts seamlessly. OBFC takes bank details, such as ABA routing numbers, IBANs, and other bank codes in the form of a standardized unique OBFC code, which is used as input for a blockchain transaction to facilitate a token transfer, which corresponds to an outgoing electronic bank transfer.

The protocol enables programmable electronic bank transfers on Ethereum. Performing an international wire transfer is as easy as transacting with the OBFC smart-contracts. Simply embed the OBFC wire transfer service right into your smart-contract and decentralized finance application and start moving fiat currency without touching a bank. The protocol makes doing “real world” currency transfers possible without leaving the digital world of Ethereum and other blockchains. The total process of initiating an electronic funds transfer and receiving receipt takes place entirely on-chain in one single transaction.

**Give us feedback!!**

[https://obfc.finance/transmit](https://obfc.finance/transmit)

We are at a really early stage in developing this system, so if you are interested in helping us or giving us initial feedback please do reach out.

We think this is a pretty interesting example of how you can use Ethereum to interact with old traditional banking infrastructure.

Please be advised, this is highly experimental right now and you not risk substantial funds at this time.

I learn of another brand that will take cryptocurrency payments: Michele Franzese Moda, which claims to be the ""first big Italian luxury multi-brand shop"" to accept cryptocurrencies. They want to accept major digital currencies such as Ethereum and others.  


For those who are unfamiliar with the name, Michele Franzese Moda is a South Italian fashion shop that was created in 1992.  
Customers may purchase from the fashion merchant's luxury inventory, which includes over 8000 products, according to the retailer. In terms of product offers, there will be new entrants.  


According to the company's fashion announcement headlined ""It's Time for Crypto,"" Michele Franzese Moda declared that they are the ""first big Italian luxury multi-brand shop"" to accept cryptocurrency payments. Items in their premium catalog have been configured to take ETH and BTC.  


We already pay in ETH NFTs, for example, and with ETH we buy all these coins that we use for payment in other projects, such as SK8coin or the celebrity marketplace nOFTEN, which I use.

I started thinking about what we might pay with ETH; there are so many initiatives and brands that now accept this sort of payment. I learn of another brand that will take cryptocurrency payments: Michele Franzese Moda, which claims to be the ""first big Italian luxury multi-brand shop"" to accept cryptocurrencies. They want to accept major digital currencies such as Ethereum and others.  


For those who are unfamiliar with the name, Michele Franzese Moda is a South Italian fashion shop that was created in 1992.  
Customers may purchase from the fashion merchant's luxury inventory, which includes over 8000 products, according to the retailer. In terms of product offers, there will be new entrants.  


According to the company's fashion announcement headlined ""It's Time for Crypto,"" Michele Franzese Moda declared that they are the ""first big Italian luxury multi-brand shop"" to accept cryptocurrency payments. Items in their premium catalog have been configured to take ETH and BTC.  


We already pay in ETH NFTs, for example, and with ETH we buy all these coins that we use for payment in other projects, such as SK8coin or the celebrity marketplace nOFTEN, which I use. However, I must confess that I did not use ETH to directly pay for stuff. When we consider that, we're already paying for a lot of things with ETH, even if we don't count the coins we purchase for future payments. What do you pay in ETH?"

&amp;#x200B;

1.  Unburnt fees (aka tips) on the execution layer (EL) begin going each block's proposer - completely liquid on the EL. Over a typical week, this is \~14k ETH / $42mm
2. Due to the amount of work required to properly test and verify the Merge across all clients, Beacon Chain validator withdrawals of staked ETH are only expected to be included in the upgrade after (Shanghai). Work from [@ralexstokes](https://twitter.com/ralexstokes) has started [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4895)
3. Post-merge, blocks will arrive exactly every 12s. Today, they arrive in a poisson distribution around \~13s. For devs: do not assume \~13s blocktimes (eg. to calculate an interest rate) - please make sure to use timestamps.  More [here](http://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer/) from [@TimBeiko](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko)
4. The Merge/ Proof of Stake will not reduce fees on mainnet. Smaller block/ slot times do increase available blockspace, but not significantly. Av. blockspace is only one input which influences fees, the other being demand. Near-term scaling &amp; lower fees will be on Layer 2s! 
5. To any stakers: you should start running a local execution layer (EL) client ahead of the Merge. In the future, outsourcing this to third-party providers will open up stakers to slashing risk under the [Proof of Custody game](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2021/09/30/proofs-of-custody.html)
6. The Merge will use accumulated difficulty (Total Terminal Difficulty) to trigger the PoW→PoS upgrade, instead of block height ""An attacker cld use a minority of hash power to build a malicious chain fork that wld satisfy the block height req"". more [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675#terminal-total-difficulty-vs-block-number) 
7. At the Merge, the 2 ETH PoW block reward goes away. new issuance will only come from PoS validators proposing blocks (\~.025 ETH) or ""attesting"" aka voting on network state (\~.00002 ETH)  4.3% PoW issuance → .43% in PoS h/t [@litocoen](https://twitter.com/litocoen). Higher security w/ lower spend!
8. Running a node post-Merge does not require any ETH (and never has). This is an important part of Ethereum culture that should be accessible to all.
