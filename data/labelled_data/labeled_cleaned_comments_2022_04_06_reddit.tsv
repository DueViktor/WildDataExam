'it will be worth more than what you paid'. This is because of the staking rewards. The amount of rEth you have doesn't change, but how much it's worth in Eth goes up due to staking.

Let's say you would have staked 1 eth in rocketpool when it launched, you would exchange 1 eth for 1 rEth. One year later you would still have 1 rEth, but this would now be worth 1,05 eth when swapping back. In this example staking rewards are 5%. In reality it fluctuates and now is around 4%, expected to be significantly higher post merge.

Since rocket pool launched a while ago 1 eth now is less than 1 rEth, but in time you will always get more eth for your rEth with this mechanism."	2e0982fd603a6f59640c8f70c96d4303f839fec3	True	False					0	1649143596		0	{}	i3go1gm	False	t3_tw6cto	False	True	t1_i3gl2pv	/r/ethereum/comments/tw6cto/lido_staking/i3go1gm/	1649143609	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_ewrat	False	False

In a round of coin mixing, the concept is pretty simple: many different people provide inputs. They all get a number of outputs, but no output is different from any other.

As such, instead of trying to track one wallet, you have to track many. And you don't know anymore who owns what among them.

The extreme point of that is if you're suddenly having to follow literally every active wallets. 

So, yeah, you could try and see where the tokens go, but, unless if the user is stupid and merge his tokens afterwards, it's not public anymore. 

For instance, you could have most of it just sitting there, a bit of it going to an exchange and getting sold for fiat, another part being staked, yet another part being lended. And you have no way to know which part is which. Some are from the person you're tracking, most aren't. The more people are in the round, the harder it gets to track anything. It's not even a problem of tracking capacity: you could track everyone, but you can't know if it's them or not, just as if you didn't track them using that data, because that data is becoming less and less relevant."	49036f3a43456b6fbc7d523663af989f4906f0d4	True	False					0	1649133775		0	{}	i3ga5ki	False	t3_twemys	False	True	t1_i3g6y7c	/r/ethereum/comments/twemys/stolen_eth_from_600m_ronin_bridge_hack_are_on_the/i3ga5ki/	1649133789	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_13pqgo	False	False

The consensus is only here to ensure no one has the power to censor any transaction they'd want. Nothing more. 

&gt;I don't think you can separate the ""consensus energy"" in BTC from the ""transaction energy.""

It's very easy, actually. You simply consider any attempted hash beyond the first one of each block to be part of the consensus. All the rest is the transaction system itself, devoided of any security measure. Just like what would happen with absolute minimum mining difficulty with zero hashing constraint beyond just data matching hash (which is required to ensure there's no fake transaction, but it's extremely easy to do). 

&gt;You can't make a BTC transaction without going through the consensus process

Sure, but this process is entirely parameterized. As I said, it's the network that wants this level of security, independently from the number of transactions they're processing. 

In a sense, it's like considering the amount of space a given light is lighting within a room. It depends on the room, not on the light. You could have an extremely bright light and a tiny room. Just as much as you could have a huge room with a very small light. 

Currently, Bitcoin is an extremely small room with an extremely bright light.

&amp;#x200B;

 The problem with BTC is that it awards miners a reward of BTC for securing and validating the network when they mine, however this reward halves in 'halvening events' every four years. This means that eventually the reward paid out to miners yearly will become very small compared to what it is today, so much so that when you factor in the cost to mine BTC: hardware, and the cost of electricity, it will eventually be unprofitable (and worse will be a cost burden) to mine BTC in basically all scenarios. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is unless of course the value of BTC increases to compensate for the decrease in rewards. However, this is dangerous to assume because it is estimated at some point (like 12-15 years) BTC will have to be worth more than the entire global GDP for it's security model to make sense for miners so that it is profitable to mine. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is not a fatal flaw yet because a lot can be done to fix it. But considering the very 'anti-change' narrative the BTC crowd has adopted, these are all fraught with real questionability. 

&amp;#x200B;

You could: 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Mint more BTC so that the supply would end up becoming more than 21 million.

\-Radically increase the fees of transacting the BTC so that miners can be paid in transaction fees.

\-You could do a combination of both while making BTC deflationary instead of inflationary. This is essentially what ETH has opted to do but it's also important to note that ETH actually does stuff, so higher transaction fees (while they should be radically lower) make some sense because you are paying for complex computations to be run and not for simple transactions. Imagine paying $100 just to send money to someone.

\-Or if you are of the persuasion that nothing should be changed, what could end up happening is that BTC mining will be subsidized by nation states who hold it in their treasuries, of course at this point the narrative of BTC and what it represents philosophically and economically, really changes. 

&amp;#x200B;

In all cases, miners are absolutely essential to the existence of BTC and in 10 or so years its unclear if any of them will be able realistically make any money. Contrary to popular belief, BTC is not some perfect rock solid evolutionary object handed down by the gods, it's a highly experimental piece of shared software developed 10 years ago. I think the biggest error was in believing the former. 

&amp;#x200B;

With this said, BTC works well as a settlement layer for ZK stuff, that's exciting, but....yeah"	9f3abcf895427096c37af1bd777e135c9c10092b	True	False					0	1649171294		0	{}	i3hyvct	False	t3_twvj8y	False	True	t1_i3hvddv	/r/ethereum/comments/twvj8y/should_i_invest_in_eth/i3hyvct/	1649171307	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_3suviujx	False	False

To an economist, people should have put off their computer purchases as long as possible. Wait a year or two and you could get a computer twice as good for the same money, or spend half as much for the same computer. This should have been a real drag on the industry.

But instead, the industry grew at an incredibly rapid pace, because people didn't just look to the future, they also looked to the past and thought ""wow, this cost $X a year ago and now it costs half that!"" or ""Wow, for my budget I can get a faster CPU and twice as much ram and storage as last summer!"" 

In terms of motivation, this isn't different from general currency inflation. There were things you couldn't afford, now you can afford them, heck with waiting.

Deflation is bad when it's *debt deflation*. Fiat currency is based on debt, so the currency supply shrinks when people are too far in debt, stop taking on new debt, and default on old debts more often. Then you do have a deflationary spiral, because the more valuable currency makes the debt even harder to pay off."	3daf15f887df46f7d8fa1f7d52dab1ca5be14a54	True	False					0	1649165313		0	{}	i3hk867	False	t3_twb559	False	True	t1_i3g0r33	/r/ethereum/comments/twb559/if_so_many_wallets_and_apps_now_exist_with_making/i3hk867/	1649165327	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_21i1m	False	False

Why wouldn't you just use the FIAT in the first place? Second paragraph is a great point, the overall uncertainty and difficulty adhering to the current ham fisted regulatory atmosphere for sure works against the use of Crypto for everyday transactions.	77ce8b697bd2234be91366a4606de8419db132e0	True	False					0	1649164765		0	{}	i3hj0op	False	t3_twb559	False	True	t1_i3hil7a	/r/ethereum/comments/twb559/if_so_many_wallets_and_apps_now_exist_with_making/i3hj0op/	1649164779	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_34g1qc3l	False	False
