Assuming you run a full node (if you don't, more on that later), you're connected to a number of other nodes. When you send a transaction, you send it to all connected nodes. When a node receives a transaction, it will verify that it is correct and if it is, it will forward it to the nodes that it is connected to. This way, the transaction is propagated through the network. But it can take a fair number of hops before all nodes are reached.

So how do you find the nodes to connect to? This is called the bootstrapping process. The software comes with a number of hardcoded addresses for nodes that are supposed to be online all the time. A user can also provide the software with one or more addresses of nodes to connect to. Once connected to one or more nodes, the software will exchange lists of active nodes that it is aware of. This way, your own node can build a list of nodes it could connect to. The next time it starts up, it'll sort that list on the last time a node was seen online and add some randomization. From that, it'll pick the nodes to connect to that time. Note that once a node has its own list of nodes, it will no longer use the hardcoded node addresses. Those are only there as a last resort if no reachable nodes are known.

If you don't run a full node, but use a ""light wallet"", you're not actually a participant in the Bitcoin network in the same way. Light wallets typically connect to a central server operated by the developer of the wallet. Any transactions and balance queries are routed to this server. This server runs a Bitcoin node and handles interaction with the Bitcoin network."	5f8fd4ca2c9a2db30788822ba26ae6fa7a3c5e40	True	False					0	1653205570		0	{}	i9jh3u4	False	t3_uv4z8u	False	True	t1_i9jey1h	/r/Bitcoin/comments/uv4z8u/how_does_bitcoin_network_exactly_work/i9jh3u4/	1653205586	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]		 gt im still confused about whom am i sending the transaction when i connect to google i know their ip because of dns when i connect to p2p network who am i sending packets to assuming you run a full node if you don t more on that later you re connected to a number of other nodes when you send a transaction you send it to all connected nodes when a node receives a transaction it will verify that it is correct and if it is it will forward it to the nodes that it is connected to this way the transaction is propagated through the network but it can take a fair number of hops before all nodes are reached so how do you find the nodes to connect to this is called the bootstrapping process the software comes with a number of hardcoded addresses for nodes that are supposed to be online all the time a user can also provide the software with one or more addresses of nodes to connect to once connected to one or more nodes the software will exchange lists of active nodes that it is aware of this way your own node can build a list of nodes it could connect to the next time it starts up it ll sort that list on the last time a node was seen online and add some randomization from that it ll pick the nodes to connect to that time note that once a node has its own list of nodes it will no longer use the hardcoded node addresses those are only there as a last resort if no reachable nodes are known if you don t run a full node but use a light wallet you re not actually a participant in the bitcoin network in the same way light wallets typically connect to a central server operated by the developer of the wallet any transactions and balance queries are routed to this server this server runs a bitcoin node and handles interaction with the bitcoin network 	0.002251881640404463	0.9892497062683105	0.18575111031532288	0.08501425385475159	0.9951797723770142	0.18571484088897705	0.1272176057100296	8.495277938891377e-07	0.43296679854393005	0.0069093587808310986

He says that regular nodes won’t talk to nodes with a changed rule set. Does that mean they immediately blacklist any node proposing an altered block? That would make it make sense; you can enforce your new consensus but it’s completely isolated.

I’d be willing to be that 90% of this sub would not. The point in asking the question is to demonstrate that the utility portion comes second for most holders. It’s the speculative nature and the potential for huge earnings that cause most to even use that damn blockchain. At the same time, the speculative/volatile nature will also dissuade mass adoption. It’s a double edge sword and I don’t think it’s irrational to bet against mass adoption.

I was making myself sad yesterday by browsing some nft's on OpenSea, and seeing all of these being generated automatically with different clothes and stuff. I already knew this, but psychologically I only came to understand the scale when I saw them lined up together, collection after collection, sold as ""unique"" items.

One cool use I see would be custom festival tickets for example, as it doesn't really cost that much more to the organizers of events to make these instead of paper ones, and it adds some uniqueness to them.

The problem I see in this system is that the bandwidth is shared between all actions on the blockchain, be it an important eth transaction or a monkey jpeg. Imo there should be different ""lanes"" for applications of different domains, like one lane for finance, one for nfts, and so on.

Also wrong. You are describing the 1970s, at the end of which the **personal** computer revolution began. By 1987, personal computers had been on the market for ten years. I had one for school. My father had a separate one for work. All his co-workers had computers at home for work as well. All my friends regardless of socioeconomic status used computers to print out their essays and school reports. The ones who didn't have computers of their own would just go to the school's computer lab, which existed ever since the early '80s. I myself taught how to use personal computers to other students and even to some of the teachers, starting around 1979.
