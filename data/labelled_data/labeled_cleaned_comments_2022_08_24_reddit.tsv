Let me know if you have an issue with the below. Other than copy-pasting the links and commands off their download page, I'm writing this from memory. For safety, double check all of those with what is on their site.

Downloading:

For Tails OS, you'll need to download the Linux Standalone release and the two manifest files. If you use Tor Browser to download them, note that Tails will only let Tor Browser access the ""Tor Browser"" folder in /home/amnesia/Persistent/. Or you can do something like this in a terminal:

    mkdir ~/Persistent/Downloads
    mkdir ~/Persistent/Downloads/Sparrow
    cd ~/Persistent/Downloads/Sparrow
    wget https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/releases/download/1.6.6/sparrow-1.6.6.tar.gz
    wget https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/releases/download/1.6.6/sparrow-1.6.6-manifest.txt
    wget https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/releases/download/1.6.6/sparrow-1.6.6-manifest.txt.asc

If you haven't already, also run these to download and import the PGP keys needed for verification:

    wget https://keybase.io/craigraw/pgp_keys.asc
    cat pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import

Verifying:

Now we can run the commands as instructed by Sparrow's download page. If you downloaded the files using Tor Browser, run `cd ""~/Persistent/Tor Browser""` first, otherwise execute these in the same terminal window after downloading the files (so your current working directory is where the files are located).

    gpg --verify sparrow-1.6.6-manifest.txt.asc
    sha256sum --check sparrow-1.6.6-manifest.txt --ignore-missing

!!! Remember to check that the response you get for each one matches what the download page says you should expect. !!!

If everything looks good, we can install Sparrow. Since this is a standalone release, that simply means unzipping the tar.gz file:

    tar -xvzf sparrow-1.6.6.tar.gz -C ~/Persistent

This will put a ""Sparrow"" folder in \~/Persistent.

Running:

Finally, to launch Sparrow Wallet, execute:

    ~/Persistent/Sparrow/bin/Sparrow

Double check where this puts your data directory. (The standalone version may just use the installation location, I don't know.) If it creates the folder \~/.sparrow then you'll want to specify the data directory so that your data is persistent.

    mkdir ~/Persistent/Sparrow/data

And launch using the specified data directory:

    ~/Persistent/Sparrow/bin/Sparrow -d ~/Persistent/Sparrow/data

If all that works for you and you want to simplify the experience (an application menu item and/or a simpler terminal command), let me know and I can help with that too."	1cf806316b5191b038620b7d3cd9ff1101906ea7	True	False					0	1661225410		0	{}	ilettz6	False	t3_wtlphs	False	True	t1_ilek4wr	/r/Bitcoin/comments/wtlphs/sparrow_on_tailsos/ilettz6/	1661283697	1	False	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]		1661226420.0	don t worry about the blue download button i think it may only be a link to their downloads page let me know if you have an issue with the below other than copy pasting the links and commands off their download page i m writing this from memory for safety double check all of those with what is on their site downloading for tails os you ll need to download the linux standalone release and the two manifest files if you use tor browser to download them note that tails will only let tor browser access the tor browser folder in home amnesia persistent or you can do something like this in a terminal mkdir persistent downloads mkdir persistent downloads sparrow cd persistent downloads sparrow wget https github com sparrowwallet sparrow releases download 1 6 6 sparrow 1 6 6 tar gz wget https github com sparrowwallet sparrow releases download 1 6 6 sparrow 1 6 6 manifest txt wget https github com sparrowwallet sparrow releases download 1 6 6 sparrow 1 6 6 manifest txt asc if you haven t already also run these to download and import the pgp keys needed for verification wget https keybase io craigraw pgp keys asc cat pgp keys asc gpg import verifying now we can run the commands as instructed by sparrow s download page if you downloaded the files using tor browser run cd persistent tor browser first otherwise execute these in the same terminal window after downloading the files so your current working directory is where the files are located gpg verify sparrow 1 6 6 manifest txt asc sha256sum check sparrow 1 6 6 manifest txt ignore missing remember to check that the response you get for each one matches what the download page says you should expect installing if everything looks good we can install sparrow since this is a standalone release that simply means unzipping the tar gz file tar xvzf sparrow 1 6 6 tar gz c persistent this will put a sparrow folder in persistent running finally to launch sparrow wallet execute persistent sparrow bin sparrow double check where this puts your data directory the standalone version may just use the installation location i don t know if it creates the folder sparrow then you ll want to specify the data directory so that your data is persistent mkdir persistent sparrow data and launch using the specified data directory persistent sparrow bin sparrow d persistent sparrow data if all that works for you and you want to simplify the experience an application menu item and or a simpler terminal command let me know and i can help with that too 	0.00313478522002697	0.9881090521812439	0.0012008545454591513	0.06338044255971909	0.008523214608430862	0.40098533034324646	0.05966828018426895	8.410410146098002e-07	0.22580945491790771	0.038336317986249924

You, like so many others--myself included, believed a falsehood.   Only US banks create dollars.  Ordinary commercial banks have certain limitations but the central bank has no limitations and everything they do is behind closed doors.  Hence the common refrain of allowing the federal reserve (central bank) ""independence"" and the refusal to be openly audited.  

The treasury does mint dollars and coins but the fed pays them for these.    It's actually not money creation.  Over 95% of all dollars are digital.  

This is dated as of 2020 since the central bank lifted reserve requirements but it still explains the process.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JG5c8nhR3LE  

https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm  

Some will try to argue that the fed is part of the government since the board positions are appointed but these positions are meaningless without an audit.  It's just show. 

If you can't know the inputs (new units created) you must assume fraud.  This is directly opposed to bitcoin where every new unit is accounted for and verified by nodes.  It's really the main point.

The government(treasury) owes a large part of it's debt to the federal reserve.  The dog wags the tail, not the other way around.  The central bank (federal reserve) is the dog and the government is the tail.  

I'm certain your first instinct will be to argue but I'm also pretty sure this is new information to you.  Just give it some time.  Research it.  Ask me some questions and then see what you think.

A lot of Bitcoiners are so convinced that smart contracts serve no purpose (and perhaps they are right) but the reality is that some people do find them promising. More than whether or not smart contracts serve a purpose, our main disdain for “crypto” should be focused on the blatant speculation gaining traction on the back of Bitcoin.

So regardless of whether side chains offer any long term value, they would allow for multiple blockchains (potentially even PoS chains though some security concerns emerge when only a portion of a larger supply make up a PoS network) to function on Bitcoin rather than some new token.

It would take the pump and dump tourists out of these experiments and force them to provide real utility that attracts people for no other reason than its interesting and useful. Any new chain with a token could be copied and made into a Bitcoin side chain. Bitcoin being the superior monetary asset (and all other things being equal) we would likely see demonetization of chains that don’t conform to Bitcoin side chain status.

I see smart contract blockchains as being interoperability layers for semi-centralized assets to communicate with each other and Bitcoin. Eventually you want Bitcoin directly interoperable with stocks, property, etc and side chains running contracts controlled by the entities in charge of these assets is a possible solution.

You don’t need the same degree of decentralization for a stock or property deed (which can already be individually targeted by the government) so these side chains can have massive blocks, or even reset entirely with sharding migrations after growing too large. A centralized backup can be maintained by the government or other controlling body for a given asset. All of this in a side chain where you only transfer the Bitcoin you are willing to risk in that world.

Many Bitcoiners will ask why this is better than just having centralized sites where you deposit Bitcoin and the answer is two fold:
1. Side chains can be made entirely transparent in their execution when desired.
2. Centralized apps controlled by different entities can be interoperable with each other by default.

TLDR:
Side chains offer a reduction in “crypto” speculation in the short term while offering semi-centralized interoperability layers between Bitcoin and all other assets in the long term (in ways that are more transparent and more directly controllable by individuals).

Disclaimer:
I do think this needs to be pursued very slowly. Paul has some ideas that improve upon the typical “crypto bridge” approach but I think it’s important to really focus on limiting how side-chains can be setup such that exploits are not happening left and right. Not saying Paul hasn’t thought about this, he has gone very deep on this. But others need to get involved and take a serious look as well."	734480a47d888447f2e33fba7811879b44baf62a	True	False					0	1661225039		0	{}	ilet4ao	False	t3_wv2lql	False	True	t3_wv2lql	/r/Bitcoin/comments/wv2lql/bip_300_301_is_worth_consideration_if_technically/ilet4ao/	1661283742	1	False	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]			i m personally very intrigued by this idea listened to his interview on what bitcoin did recently a lot of bitcoiners are so convinced that smart contracts serve no purpose and perhaps they are right but the reality is that some people do find them promising more than whether or not smart contracts serve a purpose our main disdain for crypto should be focused on the blatant speculation gaining traction on the back of bitcoin so regardless of whether side chains offer any long term value they would allow for multiple blockchains potentially even pos chains though some security concerns emerge when only a portion of a larger supply make up a pos network to function on bitcoin rather than some new token it would take the pump and dump tourists out of these experiments and force them to provide real utility that attracts people for no other reason than its interesting and useful any new chain with a token could be copied and made into a bitcoin side chain bitcoin being the superior monetary asset and all other things being equal we would likely see demonetization of chains that don t conform to bitcoin side chain status i see smart contract blockchains as being interoperability layers for semi centralized assets to communicate with each other and bitcoin eventually you want bitcoin directly interoperable with stocks property etc and side chains running contracts controlled by the entities in charge of these assets is a possible solution you don t need the same degree of decentralization for a stock or property deed which can already be individually targeted by the government so these side chains can have massive blocks or even reset entirely with sharding migrations after growing too large a centralized backup can be maintained by the government or other controlling body for a given asset all of this in a side chain where you only transfer the bitcoin you are willing to risk in that world many bitcoiners will ask why this is better than just having centralized sites where you deposit bitcoin and the answer is two fold 1 side chains can be made entirely transparent in their execution when desired 2 centralized apps controlled by different entities can be interoperable with each other by default tldr side chains offer a reduction in crypto speculation in the short term while offering semi centralized interoperability layers between bitcoin and all other assets in the long term in ways that are more transparent and more directly controllable by individuals disclaimer i do think this needs to be pursued very slowly paul has some ideas that improve upon the typical crypto bridge approach but i think it s important to really focus on limiting how side chains can be setup such that exploits are not happening left and right not saying paul hasn t thought about this he has gone very deep on this but others need to get involved and take a serious look as well 	0.0030468555632978678	0.9881439805030823	0.6651383638381958	0.02106291428208351	0.9944827556610107	0.3226890563964844	0.05972042679786682	8.33215665352327e-07	0.2481807917356491	0.04139868915081024

on the Jeff Rense show, Frank Jordan related the story of President John Tyler.

&gt; Tyler was a good friend of Thomas Jefferson who spoke, for the first time, extemporaneously, without notes, at President Jefferson's funeral for the span of 1/2 hour.  He was a fill-in who spoke because the appointed speaker was choked up with emotion.  Heretofore unknown, he gained public notoriety on the strength of that oration.
&gt; 
&gt; Immensely popular, though he did not actively seek the office, he gained the presidency in 1841.   Sharing Thomas Jefferson's fears that a central bank would take hold of the United States he made that issue a mainstay of his term of office.  London banks and the Rothschild's had been seeking a foothold in gaining America's monetary supremacy ever since British were defeated in 1812.
&gt; 
&gt; Twice, bribed by international banker's money, Congress passed legislation to establish a central bank--international banking control of the U.S.  Twice President Tyler vetoed the legislation, much to the ire of the oligarchs who desired a central bank as opposed to the Constitutional mandates as to the issuance and the form of the coinage to be issued.  These vetoes resulted in the White House being stormed and John Tyler and his family being physically threatened.  Rocks were thrown at him on Capitol grounds.
&gt; 
&gt; He was asked to run for office a second time.  The people loved this true patriot, but he declined out of concern for the safety and well-being of his family
&gt; 
&gt; His, and later Andrew Jacson's antipathy toward the establishment of a Central Bank, resulted in the bank's defeat until the passage of the Federal Reserve Act. in 1913.  History would have us be ignorant of this true patriot's contribution to America's legacy.  The gatekeepers want this man's role in history to be forgotten much the same as President John F.

Well, in 2010 the house I'm in rented for 1400 a month. Today it's almost 3K. The only time not buying a property might even be a consideration is if you're in a country that does not have access to easy financing. The idea behind buying your first house is not to make it earn income even though it will by proxy through the increase in value. It's to prevent you from losing even more via the rent increases that are going to happen. The increase in property value is just a nice bonus for a lot of people and it's also one of the ways the American middle class is made. You can take a guy who might have a net worth of 20K. Put him in a house and let him camp there for 15 to 20 years.

If you are a victim of mining block who are scammers, like 1000’s of innocent investors are, you should hastily go to tokenrecoup’s website. They are a U.S. based firm of fraud specialists who work on a no-win no fee basis. They only get paid if you are successful. No upfront fees. However, you must have proof of sending funds. I put in close to 50k and after the first few payouts these scammers refused to pay me and they even stopped replying to emails, i thought law enforcement and intelligent agencies could help but they really couldn’t as block mining isn’t exactly legislated or regulated , you willl need the help of professional consultants just like i did, sad that bitcoin devaluated before i could take action but above all i am glad that i could get my bitcoin back. That’s all that matters to me, getting it back and i did. You can reach them on their website tokenrecoup-dot-org or just send a mail to them tokenrecoup-@-mail .com. They are really experts and specialist at digital tracing and surveillance. All you have to do is be patient and watch them get to work and they’ll you recover your assets to whatever extent you want them to..

51% is the point where the tables turn, and keeping your honest blocks becomes increasingly improbable. Nodes will quickly lose the ability to create any singular consensus besides the longest, dishonest chain(s). The longer the attack persists, the easier it gets, as mining farms can't afford to have their block rewards withheld, and will have to conform, fork, or go offline to stop wasting energy.

Some people assume that nodes control the network, because they were able to win the block wars, but their belief in the extent of node control is greatly misgiven.

&gt;51% attack is also techniclalh possible in POS, but we don't need to argue how someone could get 51% of the network's tokens. 

Yeah, aside from the literal impossility of buying 51% of the stake which isn't on the market (or 67% for most BFT), the cost would be 100x greater than a POW 51%. Unlike POW, there would be no possible way to short enough to recoup your cost, because you would have to buy hundreds of billions of dollars of coin (if btc were POS), and all of your coins would be slashed when the validators unanimously move to a fork. There would be no mining rigs to sell for parts when you're done, and no way to recoup any of your cost. 

&gt;The problem with POS is that it becomes centralized over time from corporate and government capture.

That applies equally to pow, and every other asset class. You know the argument that miners have to sell their btc? Where do you think that disproportionately goes? To people who can buy the most... I can't name any POS that is more centralized today than it was a year ago. Most POS started off really centralized (a very legitimate criticism) and are slowly finding their organic (and highly unequal) Pareto distribution. I'm sure btc is slowly approaching the same distribution from the other direction, as more and more hedge funds and institutions buy it.

Even Satoshi explained that this limit is purely for anti-spam purposes, and should be increased when legitimate volume exceeds it.

Entry-level hardware around the world can handle 2MB every 10 minutes, and computer hardware is continuing to get better over time (Moore's Law). 

Corporations, specifically Blockstream (""blocking the stream"") and Lightning Labs, wanted to commercialise the open bitcoin protocol, and build a complicated, rent-seeking (fees are paid to them), and easily-censorsable network called Lightning, and cripple Bitcoin's growth so that transactions MUST happen on lightning. 

Peer to peer transactions are **impossible** on Lightning Network. You must work through a Gateway, and Gateways directly facilitate transactions and thus can be required to legally censor. 

They engaged in a variety of tactics, including censorship of their controlled communities, bad-faith attacks, and agreeing on a supposed ""compromise"" of Segwit + 2MB blocks (Segwit2X), which had near unanimous approval from the community.

This _is_ why the USAF happened: Segwit2x. However, after it was rolled out, they rescinded their word and gaslight everyone into thinking they never agreed to a 2MB upgrade.

Unless you're forking BTC, your nodes will never get to ""keep"" a block they want if 51% of the hash rate is compromised. The blocks they like will constantly be overrided by longer chains. The nodes can't replace the longest chain with a shorter chain without forking. That rule is already in the code.

This is really quite simple. If I have a transaction that I want to send to address A, and a government tells me ""if you send that transaction to address A then we will put you in jail"", that is censorship.

Whether it's moral or immoral, money laundering or not money laundering, a right or not a right, all of those are side issues that don't affect the question of *whether it is censorship*. They don't matter. You want to call it money laundering? Sure, it can also be money laundering. You want to do some bizarre contortion and try to call it *theft* somehow?

Where do you think that disproportionately goes? To people who can buy the most... I can't name any POS that is more centralized today than it was a year ago. Most POS started off really centralized (a very legitimate criticism) and are slowly finding their organic (and highly unequal) Pareto distribution. I'm sure btc is slowly approaching the same distribution from the other direction, as more and more hedge funds and institutions buy it. The more universally valued anything becomes, the more rich people will hoard it.

This is where we really disagree because distribution of bitcoin has no bearing on control of the network, unlike POS. No matter how much BTC I own, I have no control or influence over the network nor can I change its consensus rules. In POS, owning more of the token gives me more voting consensus and control. The more I own, the more I can generate with staking too, increasing a positive feedback loop.

Computation sharding (Phase 2) was dropped (in favour of data availability sampling http://eip4844.com).

Here’s the original description of this decision, which was ultimately adopted:

https://ethresear.ch/t/phase-one-and-done-eth2-as-a-data-availability-engine/5269

The merge is happening, but it’s a relatively new concept and unrelated to the previous roadmap.

It was only a year ago that it was even proven we could transition to PoS via this mechanism (gracefully separating execution and consensus layers).
