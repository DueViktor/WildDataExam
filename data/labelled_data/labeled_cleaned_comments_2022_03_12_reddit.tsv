8	[]		[deleted]						dark					[]	"Bitcoin may keep going up, but it will never stabilize, it's just not designed to.  People will not use it as a unit of account, which is fine.

Imagine trying to write contracts to a currency that can change in value by 5% in one week... Never going to happen.

But unit of account and store of value can be completely distinct.  Imagine going to the grocery store, and paying with a credit card that automatically sells shares of stocks, bonds, cryptos, commodities, to fill the exact amount of your transaction.

Currently you have to sell things, buy cash, and then make purchases, but in a defi ecosystem, the buyer and seller can automatically negotiate which assets to clear transactions.  You can cobble together payment as a mix of shares, commodities, nft shares, whatever.  The unit of account, store of value and medium of exchange are completely different.

This is the future of payments we are moving toward, so you can use whatever financial portfolio you have at the point of sale with minimal fees.

Governments similarly would not simply ""buy bitcoin"", again, too volatile.  They would trade a mix of assets as part of all financial transactions.  You would pay taxes with such a mix.

This all eases pressure on one asset to serve as a unit of account.

So with technology, unit of account, medium of exchange, and store of value can be completely different.  No worries."				1646971044	{}	i076mfs	False	t3_tb74tl	False	True	t1_i065ydc	/r/Bitcoin/comments/tb74tl/bitcoins_inflation_is_now_5x_lower_than_us/i076mfs/	1663168947.0	2	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj		0	[]

50	[]		DoYouEvenMonad			[]				text	t2_68zrkjjg	False	False		"&gt; Is the root of the 24 word sequence the mathematical representation of my ownership?

Ultimately it's just a string of 1's and 0's (a so called bit string) that you need to keep secret. You need to keep it secret, because from this string of bits, other strings of bits are generated, the so called private keys. These private keys allow you to sign transaction data, which is how to spend bitcoin. Kinda like your signature on a bank check conceptually, but totally different operationally. Who ever knows the seed (the 24 words), can spend the money associated with all the private keys, even if they are not the rightful owner. So yeah, keep it secret. 

&gt; If so, what is the wallet actually holding?

The wallet just holds the seed, and thus by implication the private keys. It's actually better to think of a wallet as a key chain that gives you access to funds, rather than a place where funds are held. 

&gt; Or is it just safely and easily allowing me to access the blockchain where my coin is recorded?

That's kinda how you can think it. But a better way of thinking about it is that actually everyone has access to the blockchain, but not everyone can spend coins that are sitting the addresses, since you need the uniquely associated private keys for each address to spend from it.

&gt; Which means I really don’t need the wallet as much as the seed phrase and some ability then to access the blockchain.

You need them both. A wallet without an imported seed can't do much, but having a seed and no wallet is going to make it hard to spend it. The seed format is a (almost) universal standard called BIP32/39/44, that can be imported into almost any wallet."				1646970039	{}	i074mx8	False	t3_tbgb0t	False	True	t3_tbgb0t	/r/Bitcoin/comments/tbgb0t/what_exactly_is_my_bitcoin/i074mx8/		1	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj		0	[]		False	9609228b6c06f8dbe9e7c60698b96e1f0638cb16	True	False		0.0		0.0	1646970050.0	True	r/Bitcoin	public
