But maybe - and that is a political thing - countries could choose Ethereum as the platform for their CBDCs. CDBCs could solve many issues we have today IF done properly.

If you can keep your node running correctly 99% of the time, you should be making nearly as much as you would if it was running 100% of the time.

The big penalties are if you make contradictory votes, which generally shouldn't happen by accident: The only place you need to be careful is if you migrate your validators to a different computer or piece of software. The software you're using should have clearly defined steps to do this, so you should just need to follow them.

I get that they exist and what they do. But doesn’t that implicitly underline that ETH -can’t- be used as a practical distributed computer and requires god knows how many additional layers and helpers to achieve this that in the end compromise a lot of the claims that Ethereum makes, like being fully decentralised and neutral (which ETH is but then many L2s aren’t and if for anything practical on ETH you have to involve subpar other solutions then…).

Twenty years from now, consumers won't really be using any of it directly. Companies will use smart contracts, especially internationally, because it will be cheaper to hire programmers to formally verify a smart contract once and use it forever to enforce asset ownership, than to pay lawyers on an ongoing basis to enforce asset ownership through international legal contracts in ever-changing legal environments.

It's possible to write provably error-free smart contracts, it's just very expensive at the moment because the technological infrastructure is still being put in place to do it efficiently. But it's possible, and it will only get easier over the next decade or two. Formal verification is the same technique they use to mathematically prove that the code in space landers is free from bugs and other unintended behaviors.

I believe that by 2050, everyone will be using blockchain technology without even realizing it or caring.

A good example being Oil. Oil is used in multiple processes to deliver other products and is traded as an asset. ETH is used in the process of computing within a blockchain to do something. From defi, to tokens, to gaming. Its primary function is to not simply be a currency, but to be the fuel to drive many other things. That could also be in the use of sending a basic currency transaction in the case of USDC or USDT... so yea...

&gt; I believe the intended minimum requirements post-merge are hovering around a Raspberry Pi equipped with a 1-2TB SSD and a 10/10 Mbps internet connection (10Mbps both for upload and download), or somewhere around there.

This makes me wonder if gas scales based on the number of nodes in the network. Presumably if a node becomes trivial to spin up for compute costs we would see many more on the network."	b205d2016dfe1b6fd2f8b7d8c95ecccdf2071dd0	True	False					0	1653924526		0	{}	iajy6tr	True	t3_v0t2ld	False	True	t1_iajl6ku	/r/ethereum/comments/v0t2ld/how_does_pos_effect_gas_prices/iajy6tr/	1653924543	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_amr84	False	False

- @Immutable’s cross-rollup liquidity solution across multiple L2/L3 zk-rollups allows NFTs to move between Immutable, StarkNet, and any L3s built on top!

- StarkNet full node Juno fully syncs the state against mainnet for the first time, marking an important step towards the alpha release.

- Proposal: Canonized Post Processing. This one's a bit difficult to explain, but basically, it defines several blocks and transactions covered by a single proof as a ""chunk"", and then you can write a program that computes these in some sort of way that leads to efficiency gains for certain usecases. Copy/pasting from the proposal: 

&gt;Examples of useful CPP:

&gt;1. Econometrics
&gt;2. Non-linear statistics, like median tx size, median fee, etc. (linear statistics, like average, can be computed without CPP, chunk by chunk), this could be used for the following
&gt;3. Fee Mechanism design - long-range statistics could feed into fee mechanism to enforce better estimation
&gt;4.  Data availability
&gt;5. Daily state-diff, perhaps even using lossless compression
&gt;6. Daily volition/validium state diff, for users who are happy with daily use of Validium but at the end of each day wish to have data committed onchain

196	[]	False		mudgen						"Okay, thanks. Here are the answers to your questions:

&gt;why use Diamond instead of some other proxy pattern? The reason to use a Diamond instead of a different proxy pattern is because a diamond can do some things that other proxy patterns cannot.

* Specifically a Diamonds enables you to have unlimited smart contract functionality at a single Ethereum address, by passing the 24KB smart contract size limit.  So if you want more functionality at an Ethereum address than can fit in a single contract then use a Diamond.
* A Diamond enables a project to develop and deploy incrementally without hitting a contract size limitation. In other proxy patterns you can upgrade the implementation contract to add new functionality but eventually the proxy pattern will hit the max contract size limit. A Diamond let's a project deploy something useful and extend the diamond over time in a standard and organized way.

&gt;Pros and cons of using a Diamond

Pros:

* Unlimited smart contract functionality at a single Ethereum address. This is useful for organizing a larger smart contract code base and integrating with user interfaces and other smart contract systems and 3rd party projects.
* Fine-grained and incremental upgrades. With a Diamond you can just upgrade the parts that need to be upgraded and leave the other parts alone, instead of having to redeploy everything.
* The capability to create independent, reusable deployed smart contracts. This is a level of modularity that did not exist before.
* Introspection and transparency of a smart contract system (a Diamond) with its loupe functions. The [louper.dev](https://louper.dev/) user interface uses this capability to show and use diamond functionality.
* A Diamond provides an organized way to extend a smart contract system after it has been deployed.
* Joining a group of enthusiastic and experienced smart smart contract developers.

Cons:

* OpenZeppelin contracts do not currently work with diamonds. But this is changing because OpenZeppelin plans to use Diamond Storage in its next major version. Diamond Storage is a technique for organizing and managing state variables, particularly in upgradeable contracts. Note that OpenZeppelin Solidity libraries do work in Diamonds. Other smart contract libraries such as [solidstate-solidity](https://github.com/solidstate-network/solidstate-solidity) and [ERC721A-Upgradable](https://github.com/chiru-labs/ERC721A-Upgradeable) can be used with diamonds.
* Learning curve to understand the Diamonds standard and Solidity techniques that are used.

&gt;typical workflow of what to do when

Diamonds is a flexible and general purpose solution to implement many kinds of smart contracts. Many projects start with a reference implementation and build on top of that or from there. Here is such a reference implementation: [diamond-1-hardhat](https://github.com/mudgen/diamond-1-hardhat).

&gt;costs of using Diamond (like cons): gas costs, complexity

**Gas cost:** The runtime gas cost to call functions on a diamond is about the same as other proxy contract patterns. Sometimes a diamond can reduce runtime gas costs in larger systems because it can share internal functions between its internal contracts (called facets) and use other techniques. More information about gas costs of diamonds is in an article [here](https://eip2535diamonds.substack.com/p/how-eip2535-diamonds-reduces-gas?s=w).

**Complexity cost:** A single diamond has multiple implementation contracts called facets. The facets can be isolated and independent from each other, in which case you can manage and think of each facet separately, which can reduce complexity. However it is possible to implement facets in a way that they share state variables between each other, in which case facets can affect each other and you need to think of and manage the facets together to the degree that they are integrated.

&gt;all this could be exemplified with a simple project with/without Diamond. To me, it is a crucial decision to go with some proxy pattern and I'd have to be able to evaluate the risks and chances.

Diamonds are useful for organizing larger projects which may not be considered simple because of the larger code base. To give an example of how a diamond can organize a code base, checkout the ""Facets"" documentation for the Aavegotchi project here: [https://docs.aavegotchi.com/overview/facets](https://docs.aavegotchi.com/overview/facets)"	73e43d8781347c28bd074a3ae0f10f71bc0959f8	True	False					0	1653922578		0	{}	iajtyme	True	t3_v0fdhg	False	True	t1_iaim810	/r/ethereum/comments/v0fdhg/diamonds_are_multifaceted_proxy_contracts_plus/iajtyme/	1653922592	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_5iv7	False	False
