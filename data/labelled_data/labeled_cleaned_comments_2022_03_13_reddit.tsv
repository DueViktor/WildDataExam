The range 0 to 32 is 33 halvings  

The halvings are implemented by right-wise bit-shifting of an integer with a value of 5,000,000,000  
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/validation.cpp#L1434  

    CAmount GetBlockSubsidy(int nHeight, const Consensus::Params&amp; consensusParams)
    {
        int halvings = nHeight / consensusParams.nSubsidyHalvingInterval;
        // Force block reward to zero when right shift is undefined.
        if (halvings &gt;= 64)
            return 0;
    
        CAmount nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;
        // Subsidy is cut in half every 210,000 blocks which will occur approximately every 4 years.
        nSubsidy &gt;&gt;= halvings;
        return nSubsidy;
    }

*COIN is defined elsewhere as 100,000,000*  

5,000,000,000 is 100101010000001011111001000000000 which is 33 bits. After 32 halvings, this number is shifted 32 bits to the right, and becomes 1 Satoshi. After 33 halvings, it becomes zero  

Also, the effect of using an integer, and right-shifting, is that when halving odd numbers, the result is rounded down. There are 11 '1' bits in 100101010000001011111001000000000 which means that rounding down happens 11 times out of the 33 halvings, including the last one  

This means the total is about 2 million Satoshis short of 2.1 quadrillion

Gold can be confiscated. Gold has already been confiscated by the US government.

Highway robbers, corrupt border guards, pirates, and others can merely kill you, then take any gold you were transporting.

Tungsten's density is very close to that of gold. There are now gold-coated tungsten bars in circulation. It requires special equipment and know-how to detect gold-coated tungsten.

    _______________________________________  

Bitcoin is easy and inexpensive to store securely.

Bitcoin is inexpensive to transport, and compared to gold, transporting Bitcoin is 'instantaneous'.

Bitcoin weighs nothing and takes up little, if any space.

Bitcoin cannot be detected and can pass right through any border or airport.

Bitcoin won't stop refugees from walking long distances, nor from swimming across rivers.

Bitcoin cannot be confiscated. Robbers, pirates, corrupt cops, soldiers, etc. won't know you own any (unless you tell them), and they cannot merely kill you and take your Bitcoin.

Bitcoin can be sent across the Internet.

Nobody spends gold as money these days.

People have been using Bitcoin as money, and as a store of value."				1647054050	{}	i0bpqkr	False	t3_tc4hah	False	True	t3_tc4hah	/r/Bitcoin/comments/tc4hah/bitcoin_vs_gold/i0bpqkr/	1663807890.0	3	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj		0	[]															gold is expensive to store securely gold is extremely expensive and slow to transport securely especially large amounts gold is heavy it takes up space you can t walk very far carrying a lot of gold you can t swim at all with more than a few coins of gold gold can be confiscated gold has already been confiscated by the us government highway robbers corrupt border guards pirates and others can merely kill you then take any gold you were transporting tungsten s density is very close to that of gold there are now gold coated tungsten bars in circulation it requires special equipment and know how to detect gold coated tungsten bitcoin is easy and inexpensive to store securely bitcoin is inexpensive to transport and compared to gold transporting bitcoin is instantaneous bitcoin weighs nothing and takes up little if any space bitcoin cannot be detected and can pass right through any border or airport bitcoin won t stop refugees from walking long distances nor from swimming across rivers bitcoin cannot be confiscated robbers pirates corrupt cops soldiers etc won t know you own any unless you tell them and they cannot merely kill you and take your bitcoin bitcoin can be sent across the internet nobody spends gold as money these days people have been using bitcoin as money and as a store of value 	0.0021854827646166086	0.9900017976760864	0.8999298810958862	0.018064526841044426	0.007310847286134958	0.1990472674369812	0.07671967893838882	8.381081215702579e-07	0.30334246158599854	0.0017654669936746359
