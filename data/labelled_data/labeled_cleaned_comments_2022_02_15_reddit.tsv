 But yeah, I also Sac'd from MM and not Ledger. Just means you have to keep track of what stuff is where. But AFAIK it's all automatic.

Morals are hard whenever money is involved. You have to be part psychopath to get anything done in our society.

Like I'm basically poor so getting take-out is a huge treat to me. On my drive home I pass massive homeless encampments, and I take issue with myself for not stopping and giving all my food away, or picking extra food up to give out. I can't afford it so I never try, but that sourness inside me ruins any meal because obviously I can afford $3 more so it was just another choice I made to play my role in society.

142	[]		jcm2606			[]				text	t2_qqvkn	False	False	[]	"No. It's a little complicated, but the best way I can describe it is to think of things as a stack of network layers, starting at the bottom and working our way up to the top.

At the bottom, we have the consensus layer, responsible for coordinating everything within the Ethereum network, somewhat making it Ethereum's L0. The consensus layer is comprised of the beacon chain, which is a blockchain that manages secondary blockchains, called shards, as well as validator responsibilities and accounts for Ethereum's proof-of-stake implementation.

On top of the consensus layer is the execution layer and the data layer, both combined representing Ethereum's L1. Both exist alongside each other, and are tied to and managed by the consensus layer via the beacon chain. Both are comprised of a set of shards (secondary blockchains), with the execution layer being a single shard that is capable of processing and executing transactions, and the data layer being a set of other shards that are solely meant to store data.

This is where Ethereum itself ends, and Ethereum-powered applications begin. Everything powered by Ethereum will reside in the execution and data layers, including all user accounts, transactions, smart contracts, etc. Ethereum may expand either of these two L1 layers, but this expansion still happens only within Ethereum's L1, no further up the stack.

On top of both the execution and data layers is the realm of L2s. L2s are not Ethereum, they're separate networks that run alongside Ethereum, while relying on Ethereum for their storage and security. Within the execution and data layers is an Ethereum-powered application, that acts as an anchor for this separate network, keeping it tied to and managed by Ethereum via this application.

This separate network may process transactions on its own, it may even go down, but this anchor means that all data within the network, including user accounts and transactions, resides in Ethereum, and hence the next level of the stack, in the realm of L2s.

So, to recap, starting from the bottom, we have:

Consensus Layer (L0) -&gt; Execution &amp; Data Layers (L1) -&gt; L2s"				1644835338	{}	hww8bll	False	t3_ss4ezn	False	False	t1_hwvu534	/r/ethereum/comments/ss4ezn/frequently_asked_questions_weekly_discussion/hww8bll/	1647164440.0	5	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m		0	[]

&gt;The incentive structure of staking rewards already incentivize client diversity and decentralization. More specifically the disincentives do

This is word salad and aktshually technically correct. Yes, of course staking penalties inherently exist. I was not talking about that. In the same we can say there is an incentive to torrent de facto with a seeding/leeching incentive, but the fact remains there was no true incentive for seeding. Blockchain solutions like filecoin et al are doing that now.

This is a very disingenuous way to say that incentives do not exist, which is the point of my post, and strikes me as head-on-the-sand, ""we cannot improve the system"" mentality.

&gt;The problem is Prysm is too good of a client with superior business-ready tech so now we're in this client diversity mess

Agreed! Hmm..... if only there was some way to incentivize diversity....

&gt;but exchanges and staking-as-a-serviec providers should know it's really in their best interest to switch because they'd get massively slash if a Prysm bugged block got finalized and rejected by other clients.

Indeed, but we can internalize this externality further by rewarding marginal diversity.

&gt;In the end, the base protocol is a protocol, so it can't know who is implementing it and with what client. All the data you could think of to fingerprint a client could trivially be faked.

This just isn't true, and strikes me as sour grapes

&gt;Plus there's not a limited set of client implementations, in theory you could code your own client that implements the spec and use that one to stake just fine. In a perfect decentralized utopia that's what everyone would do, but obviously that's not at all practical.

Indeed! Hmmm, imagine some sort of incentive structure for client diversity, paramaterized for key metrics. 

&gt;So the next-best utopia is each implementation having less than a third of the stake.

Yes and 2% fixed is the perfect inflation rate because of reasons.

Many of the ""problems"" op correctly identified are addressed with a diversity incentive structure, but he seems to busy trying not to think about it. I'm not saying that it's simple, but that we can use ethereum to fix ethereum problems."				1644852748	{}	hwx1t1w	True	t3_srs9qi	False	True	t1_hwwzvyt	/r/ethereum/comments/srs9qi/incentivized_structured_client_decentralization/hwx1t1w/		1	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m		0	[]		False	932ca76f1c0d4cc51a7f517594b1767bc14474ca	True	False		0.0		0.0	1644852765.0	False	r/ethereum	public

They are also really active on the subreddit and has a long history of being very helpful on this sub and on the Solana discord.

One down side is they already have a really high stake amount that puts them in the super minority, i.e. they are part of the top 20 validators that could theoretically collude and halt consensus.

One mitigating factor is Shinobi systems has shown some really strong community values and seems like the last person who would want to damage solana so I personally don‚Äôt see an issue for optimizing your own returns by staking with them.

You could also consider spreading your stake. We run a validator with 0% commission and are working towards having the same return levels as Shinobi. Would always appreciate a portion of your stake.

Just my experience but whenever i see questions like this it really makes me think that the poster has never engaged with projects on these chains and is just loading up their coinbase wallet hoping for the currency itself to go up in value.

But if i'd just want to address some of solana's advantages over ADA, i'd say:

1) the transaction fee in solana is basically zero.
Personally, i've never paid more than a penny for a SOL gas fee. But on ADA, the transaction fee is around 30,40 cents which is tens of times more than solana.

2) solana can currently make around 60,000 transaction per second (TPS) on its blockchain which is extremely fast, and they are planning to increase it to 600,000.
Cardano can only handle around 300 TPS.
(Etherium is around 30!)

3) the NFT market place on solana's blockchain is increasing way faster than cardano's nft marketplace which directly affects its price at the moment. 
Solana is also going to be added to opensea as a new cryptocurrency for nft trading which I believe (it's not an advice) is going to increase its price as soon as it gets added.

4) and one the main differences is the PoH (proof of history) which solana uses as a new technology which cardano doesn't."				1644827981	{}	hwvzt0r	False	t3_srpsf2	False	True	t3_srpsf2	/r/solana/comments/srpsf2/solana_vs_cardano/hwvzt0r/		1	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n		0	[]		False	2ccf9c69c89e1090ea9ab0a413b7c0d31ff05b25	True	False		0.0		0.0	1644827997.0	False	r/solana	public

I think my confusion is about the fact that in order to use mSOL in a pool, you also have to have another token to pair it with.

I understand that this is how LP‚Äôs work, but again, the effect of mSOL compared to regular SOL is then halved, plus you get the risk of impermanent loss and/or the volatility of another token too.

That is not the same thing as staking, it just isn't.  The difference may be subtle, but it is real and meaningful.

Crowdloan is the system wherein DOT holders lock their DOT to support a specific project‚Äôs chance of winning auction.

Once you understand how it works, it‚Äôs kind of a semantics difference. Basically whichever you say people know what you‚Äôre talking about.

Don‚Äôt use Ledger for crowdloans. Generally speaking you will not be able to claim rewards. The polkadot.js chrome extension can connect to your ledger, but that also will not work. Most people move the DOT they plan to use to a Polkadot.js hot wallet and contribute from there."				1644828874	{}	hww0v62	False	t3_srqc3z	False	False	t3_srqc3z	/r/Polkadot/comments/srqc3z/what_is_the_difference_between_a_crowdloan_and_an/hww0v62/	1647138858.0	3	True	False	Polkadot	t5_2ublt		0	[]
