**First Part Decentralised Financial System :** The actual system works by centralisation. We have banks and governments controlling and knowing pretty much everything you are doing. This system has many flaws that decentralised system can fix and I will present you with a few points

**Not everybody can access a bank:** The first one being that not everybody can access a bank, globally, 1.7 billion adults remain unbanked. This banking method also leaves out people from low-income countries. But decentralisation fixes this problem by giving access to everyone with DEFI. All you need to do is create an account, and that is it, no questions of the bank, no need to prove revenue, no need to prove that you exist, no nothing.

**System is slow and has high transaction costs**: The second one is that the current system is slow and has high transactions fees (7,01% fees per transaction on average). In a decentralised system, the transactions happen much faster and the costs that we call gas fees can be much lower depending on the blockchain

**I will point out one last point, because I don’t want this to be too long :** Our last point is about the low trust in financial institutions and governments. The financial services sector is one of the least trusted with only 57%. WHY?? Because the control relies on the hands of an authority, humans. Humans are easily corruptible, that is why we see many cases of fraud and stolen money from big authorities. The decentralisation once again fixes this problem. First fraud becomes very hard in this blockchain based system, because you need to pass through every computer before being able to pass your bad intended transaction and what will happen is that the computers will reject your transactions (concept of blockchain), while a human being that you pay enough would make your transaction pass.

**Second part: Changing world order** : In my opinion, we have clear signs that the end of our world order is ending, the war in Ukraine, USA losing more and more authority, countries like China gaining more and more power, etc. Whenever there is a changing world order, there is a revolution. Whether it was with the Greeks and their democracy or the Netherlands with capitalism, there were always big events happening. I think that decentralisation will be the revolution of this current controlled and centralised system. For years now the system was based on central authorities controlling every movement you were doing. All eyes on me kinda stuff. But in the last few months I am seeing technologies that will give us options to leave this system (WEB3.0, NFT’S and multiple other technologies). This time it will not be a revolution with guns and bombs, it is going to be online.

I also understand the factor of liberty and protection and our society has lived in a protected system for as long as we know. Everything I have mentioned will not be happening tomorrow morning that is clear. Maybe it will take 10 years maybe it will take 100 years. But this is my perception of things."

We have a ""client-company"" - relationship here and not a ""person and his personal wallet"" - relationship. If it was his personal wallet and he lost access to it, well thats crypto. But in this case he is a client of a company and the company is in full control over his money and the client is handling his money on a companies website designed by the company.

Again: We are not talking about a person fucking up his own wallet. This would be a basic and valid ""well this is crypto you are responsible for your wallet"" - case. BUT HERE we are already talking about a centralized organization having full control over your coins. So Kucoin controls your coins - like a bank - but when you delete the account, the arguments change and suddenly its the ""you fucked it up yourself it was your crypto your responsibilty"" argument?!

What!? NO IT WAS NOT HIS CRYPTO AT THIS POINT. Kucoin had full control over it. This is just robbery. 

Since the majority of users in the kucoin subreddit defended the action of kucoin, i wanted to get a second opinion."	kucoin takes over any remaining crypto funds of accidentally deleted accounts please explain how this is not robbing what happend user deletes his kucoin account with 1eth in it he contacted customer support of kucoin and they say its gone i checked and kucoin doesnt lost access to the coins so they still have the whole funds of that person it just became now property of kucoin can someone logically explain me how this is not robbing we have a client company relationship here and not a person and his personal wallet relationship if it was his personal wallet and he lost access to it well thats crypto but in this case he is a client of a company and the company is in full control over his money and the client is handling his money on a companies website designed by the company if the company fucked up to prevent this from happening other exchanges have this integrated so its not out of the world can you seriously give the client the responsibilty that he fucked up and thats it take in mind that the coins are not gone there are still there kucoin just refusing to send them to the person again we are not talking about a person fucking up his own wallet this would be a basic and valid well this is crypto you are responsible for your wallet case but here we are already talking about a centralized organization having full control over your coins so kucoin controls your coins like a bank but when you delete the account the arguments change and suddenly its the you fucked it up yourself it was your crypto your responsibilty argument what no it was not his crypto at this point kucoin had full control over it this is just robbery since the majority of users in the kucoin subreddit defended the action of kucoin i wanted to get a second opinion 	0.002382629318162799	0.9887899160385132	0.877115786075592	0.09813706576824188	0.007125863805413246	0.3447917401790619	0.09023170173168182	8.255780699073512e-07	0.2803407907485962	0.026662547141313553

What is a fair way to quote the price of the fair exchange rate of BTC-USD? What best practices should exchanges adopt in the public interest? 

Here's some of my concerns
1. You can't set a minimum order size lower than a satoshi, so limiting pricing to huge lots like 100 BTC as happens in Stocks and ETFs is *out*. 
2. It shouldn't be considerably more manipulable in periods of lower volume, there should be some period over which it's not feasible for a small group to control the headline number by spoofing the orderbook. 

... so maybe some sort of order-book-median running average, weighted by on-chain volume, where periods of ""real-exchange"" carry more weight than ""virtual-exchange"" - volume, since that type of trade may not be subject to appropriate fees?

Now I know what you’re thinking “of course we’re close, we’ve fallen so much so we more than likely are close genius! What’s crazy about that?” Now hear me out, when I say we’re close I mean I think this is the very bottom (relative)! 

But before I go into this, let me first state; I am a multi whole-coiner, not a whale, not a millionaire but I am doing well. I don’t trade BTC, I dca and pick up my buying the more and more price drops. As well, just because I think that this is the bottom I am still not changing my investing strategy at all of course because being in the markets long enough I have never ever been able to perfectly time the bottoms and tops so I don’t even try. I am just pitching this idea because I think I am timing the market perfectly here. Again, not timing the market with how I’m investing and I guess a better statement would be I think I am guessing the market bottom perfectly. Now hear me out. 

1. Whenever the masses are saying Bitcoin is going higher it normally doesn’t. Whenever the masses are stating it’s going much lower it usually doesn’t. What are most “analysts” predicting right now?

2. World economy, inflation, US fed, etc - we, who follow these topics, which are most investors, are all aware that rates are rising and inflation is increasing. Most people/entities who were going to sell because of war, inflation, rates etc have sold. The people who sold are waiting for bitcoin to drop lower because they fear a capitulation event but the people holding bitcoins now are mostly long term holders like me and whales accumulating. Where will all this sell pressure come from? 

3. Liquidations - we have been in this 18,6 - 21,7 level for enough time (IMO) for the ones playing leverage to get their affairs in order and reduce risk. Just as a dca guy like I have picked up my buying with prices being cheaper, the leveraged players are also lowering their cost basis as well. 

4. Black swan - the black swan always wins! 

5. You can never call a bottom and it comes out of nowhere- When btc hit its bottom in March 20’ it wasn’t until weeks and months later that we realized that that day was the bottom but in the moment and even for the following days it felt like btc could drop even harder. So many ppl missed 17,5 recently and are waiting for price to drop there or further before they buy and if prices never go there someone tell me what prices will that person be buying at next. 

I can make a much more detailed list with facts like this but again this is just for fun guys. No I am not investing my whole bag now because of this. I picked up my buying somewhat with lower prices but still dca-ing the entire way!

p.s. by the “bottom” Im guessing around 17,5 if we retest maybe even a low of around 16,9 ish to scare the last few people that still are predicting capitulation to sell as well near the bottom.

## Grape: Bringing DAO people together

The DAOs were building in Athens, the cradle of democracy.

In May, [Grape](https://grapes.network/) held [AthensDAO](https://athensdao.net/), the first community-driven Hacker House X with support from the Solana Foundation. The event brought together a who’s who of the people, groups, and communities all building new tools and use cases for DAOs on Solana.

“One of the magical things about this hacker house… \[is\] you had a niche focus and the right people to fit that niche,” said Dean Pappas, a core contributor to Grape. That led to an explosion of creativity and, as he put it, “really cool projects.”

“I try to spend my time on what I’m very passionate about,” Pappas said, “and it’s mostly digital governance.”

&amp;#x200B;

[ AthensDAO. Picture by Alevtina Yakovenko. ](https://preview.redd.it/86mnjsbu2o991.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb4c920a0907e4d37768f267a01e5f71e10ca5d5)

 It makes sense that Grape would host a house for DAOs – it’s in their DNA. Grape is a tokenized community that acts as a one-stop shop for building a community on Solana. Pappas said Solana is ideal for DAOs because “to experiment in governance and think about all these new ideas, these wacky things, you need very cheap transactions, they need to happen fast, and you need a very good user experience.”

The Grape DAO is split into several subDAO councils — such as NFTs, gaming, evaluating bounties, and more — that focus on communities in specific areas. All the councils use[ Realms](https://realms.today/realms) or [Squads](https://squads.so/), common Solana governance tools. “It is the best expression of what a decentralized community looks like,” Pappas said.

After attending [mtnDAO](https://twitter.com/mtnDAO) — a long-form, community-driven incubator and hacker house held in Salt Lake City last winter — the Grape team was inspired to host one of their own with a specific focus on governance, closer to where many of the Solana DAO builders were located in Europe. And when the Hacker House X grant program was unveiled, they applied and received support from the Solana Foundation.

And once the house got started, the 150 builders really went wild. In addition to new projects from [Civic](https://twitter.com/civickey), [Gilder](https://twitter.com/gilderxyz), and others, the members of AthensDAO formed their own DAO. “The idea behind the AthensDAO DAO is to make sure that we can perpetually do this,” Pappas said. “What's really cool about the formation of that DAO is the only people who are part of that DAO were physically there.”

What’s next? Pappas is focused on building the structure for AthensDAO DAO so they can host a future event. [But the next Hacker House X is in your hands.](https://solanalabs.typeform.com/hackerhouseX)

[ AthensDAO. Picture by Alevtina Yakovenko. ](https://preview.redd.it/86mnjsbu2o991.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb4c920a0907e4d37768f267a01e5f71e10ca5d5)

 It makes sense that Grape would host a house for DAOs – it’s in their DNA. Grape is a tokenized community that acts as a one-stop shop for building a community on Solana. Pappas said Solana is ideal for DAOs because “to experiment in governance and think about all these new ideas, these wacky things, you need very cheap transactions, they need to happen fast, and you need a very good user experience.”

The Grape DAO is split into several subDAO councils — such as NFTs, gaming, evaluating bounties, and more — that focus on communities in specific areas. All the councils use[ Realms](https://realms.today/realms) or [Squads](https://squads.so/), common Solana governance tools. “It is the best expression of what a decentralized community looks like,” Pappas said.

After attending [mtnDAO](https://twitter.com/mtnDAO) — a long-form, community-driven incubator and hacker house held in Salt Lake City last winter — the Grape team was inspired to host one of their own with a specific focus on governance, closer to where many of the Solana DAO builders were located in Europe. And when the Hacker House X grant program was unveiled, they applied and received support from the Solana Foundation.

And once the house got started, the 150 builders really went wild. In addition to new projects from [Civic](https://twitter.com/civickey), [Gilder](https://twitter.com/gilderxyz), and others, the members of AthensDAO formed their own DAO. “The idea behind the AthensDAO DAO is to make sure that we can perpetually do this,” Pappas said. “What's really cool about the formation of that DAO is the only people who are part of that DAO were physically there.”

What’s next? Pappas is focused on building the structure for AthensDAO DAO so they can host a future event. [But the next Hacker House X is in your hands.](https://solanalabs.typeform.com/hackerhouseX)

Calling all devs! The Solana Foundation Developer Relations Team has been hard at work trying to make a Q+A site for Solana developers on StackExchange.

The proposal is very close to the finish line — all it needs is a few more commits from high-reputation accounts on StackExchange and Stack Overflow. And if the proposal does not pass by June 26th, it will not be able to again.

This is the last chance! [Take a moment to commit today.](https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/126615)
