Your wife isn't telling you to throw that money away... Gold stocks are probably going to do well. I'm with you, in thinking that btc is going to do better, however. So, any money put into gold stocks should,  from that perspective, just be looked at as losing out on the performance difference, which if we're being honest, is guesswork anyways.

Perhaps the happy medium would be to negotiate an agreement to retain your current crypto holdings instead of selling now, cessate the DCA into BTC and divert that investment capital into Gold Stocks.

The levers of negotiation are thus: 

A. Any quantity of current BTC holdings to be liquidated and reinvested in Gold Stocks,
B. The proportion of new investment capital into Gold vs. BTC
C. Exit points and take-profits
And D. What to do with profits taken

You want the parameters [0% liquidation, 100% DCA into BTC], she wants [100% liquidation, 100% DCA into Gold Stocks]. A middling compromise would naturally be [50% liquidation, 50% DCA into BTC &amp; 50% into Gold Stocks]. Perhaps she would accept something like [0% liquidation, 100% into Gold stocks] or [20% Liquidation, 75% into Gold Stocks]. Maybe she would even accept [0% liq, 50% DCA]. You just have to open the issue up to negotiation.

But bear in mind, your wife is along for the ride and she isn't comfortable with the current structure of [your investment portfolio + your investment strategy]. Let her know that you want her to be comfortable with it, but that you feel very strongly about the strategy you are currently employing, and find metrics that will put her at ease while not causing you to feel deprived of the opportunity that you are interested in putting your shared financial futures towards.

The ideas of when profits should be taken, how they should be allocated, and all of that can be worked out if you guys want to dive into the details on that end, but her feeling of security needs to be considered. If she wants to hedge the crypto bet with gold, it isn't like that money is just going to be thrown away.

The United States Government cannot let bond yields rise or they will literally become insolvent (debt to GDP is in excess of 130% it was 30% when Volcker did what he did -- that cannot be done again). 

In fact the US Government has a vested interest in not only keeping bond yields as low as humanly possible, but to default on their debts through inflation.

Also I don't trust the US Government to pay back bonds -- plenty of Governments have defaulted on bond obligations.

&gt;I am attracted to the Volcano Bond in El Salvador. Whats it pay? 6, 6.5%? And a BTC bonus after 5yr?  


Yeah I think it's 6.5% -- I can see how that's good a good idea. I'd like to invest in them myself.

But, I'm less interested in the yield as I am just supporting the overall project. I want to lend money to El Salvador because I like what they're doing.
