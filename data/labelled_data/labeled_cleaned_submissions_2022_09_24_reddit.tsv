Today I was in restaurant having my dinner and saw a women outside looking at menu for long time. After looking for it for 10 mins, she finally decided to enter the restaurant sat on a seat with a torn plastic bag with clothes. She looked really a normal working person (I assumed). 

She looked at the menu again and counted 5 euros note and few cents in her hands and after finding nothing in the menu, she stood up and left. 

I really wanted to walk up to her and offer her to eat and I would pay but before I could do that she just was found nowhere on the street. 

I don't know how many of you have noticed it but there is whole new layer of population that have become poor in last few months. It is just astounding. 

We all plebs and bitcoiners like to say that ""BTC is the answer"" but I have come to stark realisation that we are too early and to explain why this problem exist and why BTC is the answer, it takes a proper homework from the person itself. 

It is not that easy to explain.

But, most people are dumb. They will see a fast/cheaper money-transfer solution that is being offered by a ‘trusted’ source, so they will all jump on it. And if/when fiat fails, what better way to scare people into using your shiny new currency that is fully-controlled and monitored at all times.

Solutions like bitcoin take control away from government and give that control back to the people, which cannot be allowed (according to those in power). So, these scary solutions will be pushed out, taxed, and prohibited et al. so that people will have no reasonable choice but to use the ‘official’ currencies, whatever form that ends up being.

Every, single time money exchanges hands, every purchase, will be monitored, tracked, taxed and fully-controlled. They will know how much you have, where it came from and where it’s going -at all times. They will decide if you are allowed to make certain purchases or transfers, based on your age, location, nationality, tax debt, child support debt, criminal history etc.; whatever they see fit.

Eventually, even your political views and online posts may be weighed as a matter of national security, allowing justification of more control. Something like this will need to be in place before a universal income system is established, which seems likely to happen, eventually.

- API3 is a collaborative project to deliver traditional API services to smart contract platforms in a decentralized and trust-minimized way.

- It is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), namely the API3 DAO. Therefore, its code is open source and its operations are transparent.

- The vast majority of the external integrations that decentralized applications need are to commercial Web APIs that traditional businesses have built to monetize their data and services.

- Therefore, what is widely known as the oracle problem is in practice an API connectivity problem.

- Existing oracle solutions fall short because they fail to make this distinction, resulting in inferior solutions that depend on third-party oracles and ecosystems that exclude API providers.

- By refining the definition of the problem, API3 aims to provide a much more optimal solution.

- At its core, API3 brings the ability for API providers to easily run their own oracle nodes.

- This allows them to provide their data on-chain, without an intermediary, to any decentralized app (dApp) interested in their services.

- At the heart of this mechanism sits Airnode, an open-source oracle node.

- It's designed to be easily deployed by any API provider with almost no maintenance.

- Because of Airnode, dApp developers can write smart contracts to interact with the on-chain data of API providers.

- Airnode is designed with mechanisms to remove the on-chain or off-chain concerns of API providers.

For the past \~6 months, contributors have been building the KZG Ceremony, a pre-req for protodanksharding / EIP-4844. Hopefully, in 2 weeks we'll be collecting a community contribution from the mainstage audience at EFDevcon! 👀 learn more: [github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony](https://github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony)

&amp;#x200B;

these Ceremonies have been called other names as well: Trusted Setup, Parameter Generation Event, Powers of Tau. Projects like aleoHQ, Zcash, Filecoin, CeloOrg, privacyscaling, tornadocash, 0xPolygonHermez, + others have all used these to add privacy or consensus improvements

&amp;#x200B;

Ethereum will be using it to enable scalability. In a ""rollup-centric"" world, getting cheap data (EIP-4844) to rollups is important! 🚀 Here's Vitalik's summary of what the ceremony generally involves (key: only 1 honest participant needed!) [https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/03/14/trustedsetup.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/03/14/trustedsetup.html)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  That is to say, **hundreds of people participate in generating the data together, and only one of them needs to be honest and not publish their secret for the final output to be secure. Well-executed setups like this are often considered ""close enough to trustless"" in practice**. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our ceremony will:

* be browser-based (accessible, no large files to download)
* only take \~2 min to complete
* aim to have the largest set ever (5k+ contribs)
* provide an easy to audit transcript (output summary of all contribs, which proves the ceremony is legit)

So far we've written the spec, main implementation, and gotten them both audited 🙌 Next, we will be finishing the sequencer + interface, testing that all the components work well &amp; organizing addtl security reviews. 🤞 If timing works out, we'll see you onstage at u/EFDevcon!

&amp;#x200B;

Post Devcon, there will be a public contribution period (\~2 months) where anyone can add their randomness to the ceremony 🎲 This is a great way for anyone to participate in building crucial Ethereum infra primitives 🛠 all you'll need is a desktop browser and a few minutes!

**Why this service exist if the transactions on Solana are so low?**

&amp;#x200B;

If we want to make mass adoption a reality, we need to implement some freemium models on our DApps, but we all know that, obviously, when a user create a wallet, he has ZERO money on it, so how could a user sign a transaction with no money at all?

A service like Cowsigner allows you do to (also) that.

&amp;#x200B;

*You can stop reading here, but there are other use cases where you'd want to be the fee payer of your customer's transactions.*

&amp;#x200B;

**For example:**

* We all know that the transaction itself is low, but the price ""drastically"" increase if you need to save data on chain. For few strings you may end up with a cost of 20 cent, if you multiply it for 10 or 20 transactions per day, the cost to use your dapp became too expensive. Think about it, maybe you are creating an application that is more profitable if you let your user focus on paying you rather than focus on paying blockchain fees?
* Imagine that you are a company and you need to create a decentralised application to manage some of your internal work. Wouldn't be helpful a service that manage all your employee wallets, let you set the threshold of spending, and, more importantly, save you the time of checking every employee wallet and don't force you to send money around?
