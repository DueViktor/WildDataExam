Higher-level solutions like Layer 2 rollups fix those

The rest of your post is incoherent. What do you want? It lists a bunch of wallets. Several with linux support (Gnosis Safe, Frame, MyCrypto, AirGap Wallet, Opera Wallet, Coin Wallet, Guarda), I don't know how you only found one.

By far the easiest way to get ETH is to just buy it. If you seach for mining on ethereum.org you find this https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/mining/#top which also warns you that:

*Proof-of-stake will soon replace proof-of-work as Ethereum's consensus mechanism, meaning mining will be switched off. Instead, Ethereum will be secured by validators who stake ETH. You can start staking your ETH today. Read more on The Merge, proof-of-stake and staking.)*

Bitcoin: laser focused on hard money, the 21 million meme, low node requirements, and have quite quickly ossified. Pros: people trust in the scarcity of BTC. Cons: they ossified before becoming Turing-complete so very limited usecases; it also looks inevitable that they will have a major security problem in the next decade or so because fees are not making up for decreasing issuance.

Ethereum: focused on a Turing-complete L1 while retaining decentralisation via low node specs, and pushing for minimum viable issuance and scaling. Pros: a lot of economic activity because of the ability to run arbitrary code; there won’t be a security crisis because validator pay isn’t reducing every 4 years; Ethereum is setting itself up for global scaling through rollups and danksharding. Cons: because it is still being actively developed, people are rightfully not convinced that there won’t be further monetary changes.

Solana: focused on “decentralised enough” in order to push capacity at the L1 as high as possible by making noderunning/staking a very high spec requirement. Pros: there is no confusion about rollups/L2s, the experience is polished and simple. Cons: there has been a lot of network instability because of the lack of fee market; there are basically no nonvalidating nodes because it is too costly to have them; there will be high issuance/inflation for the foreseeable future.

Each of these guiding values, along with the community and developers, helps shape an L1.

I use a bunch of them because I want to try things, this is not some sort of advanced strategy just FYI - I stared with Kraken, then fearless and now that staking is available on Acala and parallel I am trying there - with DOT @ current price levels, good time to try things. 

My experience with fearless - I picked the 16 validators months ago (6 months maybe) - I get daily rewards, never had to make any adjustments. As far as I can tell I was nominated every single Era since. So in short I have had 0 problems. Back when I stared you needed 120 DOT, now there is a variable limit, but I understand you still need a decent amount to get nominated constantly (I would assume 250 or above to be safe, but maybe it’s less)

The only issue I have is that I cannot add more funds to the staked amounts on fearless I get an error - I have to go to polkadot.js and do it there - pretty simple but kind of annoying to be honest - eventually I’ll reach out to support to figure out the issue 

I do like acala and parallel because instead of the daily staking rewards, the value of the liquid derivative changes in relationship to DOT. This way you don’t end the year with a million transactions for tax reporting at the end of the year.
