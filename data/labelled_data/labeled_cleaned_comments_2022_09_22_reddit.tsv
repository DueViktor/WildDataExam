In the USA and Europe, there are proposed regulations and some recently implemented regulations allowing banks to hold Bitcoin for their customers, but a very significant limitation. Unlike other assets, these regulations require the custody holder to have a 100% reserve  

This effectively bans fractional reserving of cryptocurrency, because the same regulations will be applied to cryptocurrency exchanges. This was discussed here a couple of months ago, but not in detail. It was also mentioned in Frances Coppola's blog last year  
https://www.coppolacomment.com/2021/06/bank-capital-and-cryptocurrencies.html  

With respect to banks, the reserving is extremely conservative. The regulators (and BIS) do not want to allow partial reserving, because then a liquidity shortfall would call upon government bank account guarantees. That is, nobody wants to be exposed to a bank bailout caused by run on Bitcoin withdrawals  

The 100% reserve requirement is a disincentive to banks offering Bitcoin custody, especially at a consumer level as you're describing  

With respect to cryptocurrency exchanges, the reserve requirement appears to be a response to the consumer impact of recent exchange collapses. Cryptocurrency exchanges have no government backing, no bailouts  

What's missing from the discussion is that the regulation makes many cryptocurrency exchanges instantly non-compliant, and urgently needing capital injections to build a 100% reserve"	980d7cd6e4ac3d4196f53bc8542b0bd1968841a4	True	False					0	1663761088		0	{}	ipbi1ry	False	t3_xje6ry	False	True	t1_ipavdek	/r/Bitcoin/comments/xje6ry/the_hard_21_million_limit_and_fractionalnotional/ipbi1ry/	1663761105	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]

So I would say the maximum max has is maybe 5,000 btc to be generous.

The point is that you're looking for a balance, and not seeing an answer. The answer is in the transaction list  

The Bitcoin blockchain does not know your wallet, or its balance. It only records transactions. You're recovering your wallet by scanning the blockchain. The balance is nothing more than a calculation performed by the wallet app (in this case, the wallet functions of the Core software).

Of course I did not spend all my coins.  I would know if I did.   What do you think I'm trying to get back my wallet for?


&gt;Bitcoin doesn't do accounts or balances.

Yes is does.  Are we on the same planet speaking the same language?  Of are you just one of the type who disagrees with random stuff for the sake of pointless dialog.

&gt;Your post does not say you waited for the sync to finish. Check the progress indicator at the bottom of debug.log 

Duh.  Of course I waited.  I also turned the computer on, and opened the Bitcoin core software.  Breathed in air too.  But I didn't think that would be a necessary detail.  It should be assumed, as the BTC core software will not fully function or show a final balance until it completes the sync.  Yeah, the balance you say it doesn't display or have.

&gt;Paste all the addresses into the Electrum wallet app, as a watching-only wallet. Electrum will display transaction history (and balance) within 40 seconds
