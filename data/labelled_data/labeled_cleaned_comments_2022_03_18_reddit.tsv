This makes it is no mere Mac no longer, it is a bit too pricey. I guess you can have better machines at server side jobs than this one. As I said earlier it is practically impossible or let me change the wording it is unpractical to run it on a Mac for now. And I don’t also think a M1 chip can compete with a server side cpu on validation jobs, it lacks most of the architectural remedies intel and amd has on their chunky cpus.				1647498631		{}	i0zltlq	False	t3_tfokq5	False	True	t1_i0z49bb	/r/solana/comments/tfokq5/any_plans_to_upgrade_tps/i0zltlq/	1667231565.0	1	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n		0	[]

Its not really about the licensing or development, its purely about what is actually actively running on a live publicly accessible service. I didn't really make the distinction in my original comment, but my main argument is really about verification of the running service. So when I said ""open"" I didn't really mean OSI open source (although I do support that!) but just that for decentralized trust and control to make sense for DeFi, the running smart contract needs to be verifiable by anyone (not just those the developers appoint). Whether your code is proprietary or whether its developed in private prior to release is not really important, or at least a separate discussion.

I brought up the proprietary thing though because that's how the article read to me: as a rationalization of their decision, so I responded to it as such. But that's really not that important overall, the DeFi trust aspects are the important part.

&gt;This is some great energy you put into this response btw. There's a lot of teams that are looking for people to help out with communication. 🍻

I appreciate the complement! Although I dunno if that's really something I'd excel at, outside of a few things I'm passionately opinionated about 😉.

As a reference I am proactive support for [marinade.finance](https://marinade.finance), and some of our code has been opened, with the rest in transition.

Being completely open source can be time consuming, as you've got a lot more members contributing in different time frames. It can be a roadblock managing anonymous code contributions when you're trying to innovate fast.

The last public spaces meeting hubble hosted showed me that they've got a lot of UI changes, and a lot of great ideas for furthering lending (seriously cool stuff).

117	[]		guywithknife			[]				text	t2_3q6bu	False	False		"So after half a day to think about it more, I wanted to add some nuance to what I wrote above. The comment above was a direct response to the parts of the article I take issue with, but it doesn't talk about what I personally think is ok or not in terms of DeFi development, so I wanted to add a little bit of that:

First, I say ""open"" above but I don't actually mean ""open source"" as the OSI defines it, I just mean ""source available"". I'm new to Solana development and have not yet played around, so don't yet know how it works here, but on Ethereum, you can verify your deployed smart contracts which makes the source visible on the block explorer. That is really all that's required: a way to view the code that is deployed. It doesn't have to be MIT/GPL/BSD/Apache/Mozilla/Whatever licensed, it can be proprietary. It doesn't have to be on Github. You don't need to show every commit or change, just the code that's released to the public as an actually running smart contract.

So, with that in mind, I think its perfectly reasonable for Hubble or anyone else developing DeFi services to develop in private, without revealing their code, as long as the service is not publicly running. As soon as you run a service, the code for the running version I believe must be viewable and verifiable for DeFi decentralization to make sense. But any private development versions before and between releases can absolutely be kept closed and private. That's purely a business decision and I have no issue with it. I mean, I love open source and think its greatly benefited the world, but its up to each individual to decide if or what they contribute and I won't begrudge anyone who chooses not to. That's not the issue here, the issue is whether or not I have access to the code that is live, running their DeFi service, so that I or others can verify that the running service does what it claims, because if I cannot, then the trust required and control that the developers have negates the raison d'être of the decentralization of DeFi."				1647523705		{}	i10kxz2	False	t3_tft5mu	False	True	t1_i0y1p1r	/r/solana/comments/tft5mu/its_safe_to_say_that_solana_devs_are_solving/i10kxz2/		1	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n		0	[]		False	6000ba0d2fdfe8254155799d923a61f3369f348c	True	False		0.0	0.0	1647523722.0	False	r/solana	public

My question is, will I continue to get staking rewards when the wallet itself is not online? Im thinking yes, like the SOL was moved on the block, and the wallet is just an interface to see  my tokens..  however I wanted to see what everyone’s thoughts were.
