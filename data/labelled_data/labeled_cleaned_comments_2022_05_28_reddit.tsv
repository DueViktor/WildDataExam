The fact is Bitcoin in my personal opinion is undervalued - namely because it is the only decentralised asset class and has one of, if not the, most strongest networks on Earth... and yet hasn't completely sold out. Since the world is changing its tune, people are ""getting their place"" now before mass adoption kicks in and potentially prices them out.

This is why it is seen as an investment - and that is why Bitcoin price is volatile, in addition to the leveraged trading going on. But that volatility is reducing throughout Bitcoin's lifetime. 

Waiting until it stabilises in order to involve yourself in Bitcoin makes yourself an end-user, like all of us will be, but not really a speculative investor - your minimalised risk comes with an expectancy of minimalised gain.

Bitcoin works as a means of payment thanks to layer 2 solutions such as the Lightning network - its the countries' infrastructure that need to catch up with Bitcoin, not the other way around.

I'm not sure how adoption of Bitcoin by traditional finance therefore nullifies high liquidity and independence from financial intermediaries."	14d4f1b1ea6fb2e0016bc6b961ccf6172f3faf27	True	False					0	1653637971		0	{}	ia63bnt	False	t3_uysbq1	False	True	t3_uysbq1	/r/Bitcoin/comments/uysbq1/why_should_i_invest_in_bitcoin/ia63bnt/	1653637981	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]

Cryptocurrency is a wonderful concept, that can truly revolutionize the world. It can end wars, it can stop mad race of growth by unlimited lending and most importantly solve the huge problem of preservation of wealth over generations.

The big problem however is distribution of currency across the entire world and of course, we still do not know who hold the majority of these currencies. When we do not know who are these whales, and what their intention is, how can we as general public trust the coin? How can we let them control the monetary policies of this world,  when lets say Bitcoin has replaced FIAT.

Bitcoin is always counting on underlying algorithm and network as asset. The problem I see is quantum computing computing. If humans one day are able to have the quantum computer work, would these Crypto coins be safe? Are these crypto's quantum proof? This is why I don't buy the logic that, we are buying a computer program as an asset when we buy Bitcoin.

I agree FIAT system is broken. However, Bitcoin isn't doing anything to solve this problem.

If that means it’s a reserve currency for smaller countries who wish to escape being dollarized it could very well stabilize in the next decade though I would expect some degree of volatility to exist in the exchange rate to USD.

If that means it’s the main reserve asset for all nations then it would need to at least 50X in value from here (to match USD global supply given its currently the largest reserve currency). That will not be able to happen for many decades IMO.

If it completely replaces all fiat and becomes the only money in the world then it has to grow A LOT more than 50X to represent the circulating supply of all fiat currencies. This has zero chance of happening for a very long time unless fiats experience an implosion (which could happen but I’m hoping for a slow faded death for the sake of humanity).

Given we have to both reach one of these stages and settle into it being the limits of Bitcoins adoption, it’s likely Bitcoin behaves more like an upward roaming store of value investment for the next 20-30 years, if not our entire lifetime.

Others believe this can happen much sooner but I don’t believe we can achieve this without some kind of massive societal upheaval because the amount of value that would need to switch over to Bitcoin is just astronomical."	5e855de5a0d7b27eab2f7d41cbb1542bc2e6e186	True	False					0	1653636592		0	{}	ia61s44	False	t3_uysbq1	False	True	t1_ia60r8z	/r/Bitcoin/comments/uysbq1/why_should_i_invest_in_bitcoin/ia61s44/	1653636607	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]

A 51% attack, however, is theoretically limited in the amount of disruption it can cause.

Bitcoin has a fundamental advantage from both a decentralization and monetary perspective **as money.** Some people here will claim PoS systems are not secure, but I actually grant that they are secure in a certain fashion. They are secure from being exploited via 51% attacks (fake transactions).

However, PoS systems give the power to fork the chain (and thus change the rules) to the largest stakeholders. This makes it much less neutral in terms of power dynamics between individuals and their wealth in the chain.

This might be fine for tokenized stocks, web3 whatever if that ever actually means something, etc. **but it will never be good for money itself** because it behaves like an equity. It's just not neutral enough to be non-state, non-stake holder controlled wealth.

The people in Bitcoin writing code can only change Bitcoin if the miners accept the changes. Miners can only change the code if the individuals running nodes accept the changes. Bitcoin has a balance of powers governance system similar to the US federal government and its three branches.

PoS chains have only one governance system: Stakeholders. If the majority of stake (not to be confused with the majority of individuals) wants to change the code, it changes.

Bitcoins purpose is to be political neutral, stateless, fixed supply sound money. It will become both a store of value and a medium of exchange once it grows much larger (market cap is only 2% of USD circulating supply). It will eventually only grow to the extent that fiat expands, or in the case where fiat no longer exists it will grow in purchasing power as technology makes producing things cheaper."	91333b7d7db3fe59dbd2080b534f295962b05631	True	False					0	1653635158		0	{}	ia604bo	False	t3_uysbq1	False	True	t3_uysbq1	/r/Bitcoin/comments/uysbq1/why_should_i_invest_in_bitcoin/ia604bo/	1653635172	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]

We only know that Satoshi mined the genesis block (which can't be spent) and block 9. It's possible that Satoshi could have mined between 600,000 and 700,000 BTC but we will never know for a fact.

Since there was over 3 days between the genesis block being mined and block 1 being mined (and difficulty was 1), it's safe to assume that Satoshi waited for other miners to start mining before joining in. 

Below is two examples of early bitcoin miners that were mining alongside Satoshi from the start.

In this closed system discussion where we posit *only* 2 people using Bitcoin, they would be damned in either case - holding BTC or holding cash.

Thankfully we have a much larger Bitcoin system.  Therefore when the government doubles circulation, people who hold Bitcoin *do not lose purchasing power*.  They can either

1. use the BTC in a BTC marketplace for goods and services, since there are so many companies and people that accept Bitcoin now.
2. sell the BTC to cash at now double the fiat price\*\*, and conduct business in fiat where necessary.  They neither gained nor lost purchase power despite a doubling of USD holdings, since USD was inflated.

I think you can see Bob and Alice would be happy with either #1 or #2.

\*\* of course this is not an instant price reflection, and price in real life depends on many factors.
