Though from an implementation standpoint, I don't think it would be possible for *certain tokens* that follow the ERC20 standard to have this kind of property. If 10 tokens expire at 2023 and 10 tokens expire at 2024, they are not fungible. Even more concerning is that each smallest fractional unit of a token would need it's own uint256 time slow, which, even if is possible, would be immense amounts of storage.

&gt; Of course, you could also create a service that lets any such incentivized person instantly sell these tokens against any other crypto, including stablecoins, to anyone willing to automatically pay for these tokens. Such tokens are best handled by people willing to purchase your service (aka consumers) or who know who would (some kind of retail sellers).

The supply still increases though, right? It's just that N% is owned by the service now."	fd0ab39278e9be106152566d95e436e3f1d0905d	True	False					0	1658116823		0	{}	iglp28s	True	t3_w19hmo	False	True	t1_igk5clq	/r/ethereum/comments/w19hmo/tokenomics_preventing_inflation_for_awardance/iglp28s/	1658116837	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

In practice however we're talking external factors dictating how much gets issued and how much gets burned. The staking market dictates the appropriate risk/reward curve for holding and staking ETH (which decides how much ETH gets issued), and the gas fee market dictates the valuation of blockspace (which decides how much ETH gets burned)

But the long term equilibrium should be a very low net inflation, close to 0% on average. But it's impossible to predict accurately since it depends on many external factors. If we have ongoing deflation, at some point people won't be willing to bid as many gweis on blockspace as before (e.g. 100 gwei when ETH is $1,000 is as many dollars at 10 gwei when ETH is $10,000 but the latter burns 90% less ETH) and same thing in the opposite direction.

61	[]	False		gaitlx22			[]				text	t2_2rv4tumb	False	False	"I believe ETH is going to dump hard after the ETH locked on the Beacon chain becomes freely tradeable. 3 Reasons for this:

* Roughly 90% of the 13m ETH was deposited prior to May 5, 2022, i.e. when ETH started to truly freefall. There are 409,000 [validators](https://beaconcha.in/charts) as of yesterday, of which [42%](https://etherscan.io/dashboards/beacon-depositors) came from staking pools. The only reason someone would stake through a pool is that they don't have the 32 ETH required to stake (or aren't comfortable investing that much in ETH). In other words, 42% of staked ETH is comprised of largely FOMO investors, who likely would have sold during this crypto crash had their ETH not been locked up. Once that lockup ends, there will be a lot of selling pressure, to which we know weak hands will fold.

* Beacon's staking yield is currently only ~4.2%; this has been kept artificially low by the inability to withdraw deposited ETH. To put this into perspective, [investment-grade corporate bonds](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLC0A4CBBBEY) are currently yielding [5.1%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLC0A4CBBBEY)... If you're not familiar with how interest rates work, the riskier an interest-bearing investment, the higher the interest it must pay out - think about why your APR on your credit card is so much higher than what your bank pays you on your savings account. Given the recent volatility and blowups we've had across the crypto landscape recently, the asset class as a whole is now deemed far riskier than it was during the 2020/2021 bubble. No rational investor is going to keep their ETH staked earning only 4.2% once it's freely tradeable. Therefore, once the staked ETH becomes unlocked, there will be a mass withdrawal (which will cause the APR to spike). It's not hard to imagine those who withdraw from staking will also sell their ETH. 

* This last point is just my opinion, and I mean no disrespect to the community. If you take away all of the hype and speculation and look at the economics of what Ethereum actually is, it's a massive decentralized supercomputer. The Ether token in its current proof-of-work structure exists to incentivize miners to spend the $$ (capex + electricity) to secure the network, and to incentivize meaningful usage of the processing power via gas fees. The only real consumers of Ethereum (i.e. excluding speculators) would be those who wish to consume processing power on the network for smart contracts, and those who wish to transact through these smart contracts for real purposes (NFTs, in my opinion, are just more speculation and therefore not ""real purposes""). Therefore, the intrinsic value of one ETH pre-merge is theoretically the miners' incremental capex and electricity (plus some profit margin) required to create that ETH. Here's where this becomes relevant: after the merge, it's expected that the processing power/energy consumption necessary to secure the network will fall in excess of 90%. This means (again, in my opinion) that the intrinsic value of Ether will fall in excess of 90%. 

I'll close with a final thought. The thing I keep coming back to is that Ethereum is often touted as ""the new internet."" However, Ethereum is nothing more than the *infrastructure* that will underlie this new internet. In my opinion, the Ether token today is akin to the broadband fiber-laying companies that skyrocketed during the late 90s/early 2000s tech bubble and crashed thereafter. The market was *dead right* about the internet bringing about an entirely new world, but those who lost money on fiber-laying companies ultimately bet on the wrong thing. It wasn't the infrastructure of the internet itself that turned out to be wildly profitable, rather, it was the businesses that were built on top of it. I do believe there is a real future for Ethereum, I just don't think Ether itself is going to turn out to be the correct way to invest. We probably can't even envision what the future use cases for ETH will ultimately be - especially when you combine it with future widespread 5G coverage. Think about it this way - could you have imagined Uber existing before 4G came about?"	d1b0758a6008f1efcc69a008a25ea15273e67fcc	True	False					0	1658140333		0	{}	igmk59z	False	t3_w1uwjf	False	True	t3_w1uwjf	/r/ethereum/comments/w1uwjf/the_merge_pump_or_dump/igmk59z/	1658140345	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

68	[]	False		Crazycrossing			[]				text	t2_4jmep	False	False	"I'll take a crack at it as someone that is a game dev working for a web2 company that is trying to enter Web3 and as someone that grew up playing proto-metaverse like games and even made a living off one for years and still make money off one.

They don't have too many specifics yet but going by the different SDKs you can sign up to test here:
https://otherside.xyz/odk

They're making another user generated content game (UGC) Roblox, IMVU, Second Life type game. A game powered by creators that create niche tailor made experiences and forms of expression and sell them most likely with Ape Coin to other consumers/players/other creators.

OP mentioned Entropia as well and a bunch of other MMOs have accidently stumbled into this model as well like Eve Online though they never gave direct SDKs to players to create avatars or some creator marketplace to build direct content into the game. Instead they provided some APIs to enable all sorts of other economic and political created content.

I fundamentally believe this is the vision of web3, the next big metaverse, and blockchain gaming. It's the perfect use case for blockchain gaming.

Right now you can see these models tested out, there's a huge hole IMO for a modern version with all the innovation that has happened since/

IMVU is one I made a living off of by selling 3D fashion meshes to 2D texture artists. I would create a base mesh based on current fashion trends, market it to other creators on IMVU, of which IMVU has a derive system where they can derive off my mesh, make their own 2D textures and submit it and market it to players. I'd get a cut off all the profits derived from my base 3D mesh.

Sound familiar? You could easily make a more roboust system on chain for people to derive off of with smart contracts and everyone gets a fair royalty cut, incentivizing tons of content creation. You could expand it to pieces of code and game designs, really anything and everything. You could even solve the IP theft problem by allowing brands to get a cut built into the contracts, if an ecosystem developer was smart they'd be building all this right now.

Another problem with IMVU is that they've done some sketchy stuff over the years in regards to payouts, for example you can only cash out a certain amount into your bank account based on some calculation of your total sales over the last 12 months. Your money has to sit in their account basically forever as you never can cash it all out and they can disable you at anytime for very little justification. IMVU is also extremely aged tech at this point and doesn't have the developement or investors to overhaul it. They did a good job releasing it on mobile which did make it more successful over the last few years. But why do Second Life and IMVU persist? because they offer something to people that isn't anywhere else on the market.

Why do people play virtual social games like IMVU? Because they can express themselves in ways they can't IRL for an assortment of reasons.

Moving on roblox and minecraft have become the juggernauts they are because of UGC.

The crazy thing is, minecraft has never directly incentivized UGC, I believe they're leaving money on the table by not creating a better ecosystem for people to monetize their modded creations and communities built in Minecraft. With that said there's plenty of people that have made 6 figure incomes and 7 figure incomes off creating these great gamemodes in Minecraft and selling 'donations'. It reminds me of my teens playing Garrysmod where I did the same, I built up multiple good communties, got custom scripts, and sold 'donations' to keep them running making 5K a month.

Lastly, we've seen Fortnite experiment with offering virtual experiences like concerts and promotional events for other brands. Fortnite is trying to turn itself into a metaverse of some sort because they recognize that experience is popular and lucrative. 

Folding all of the above together, will take off in a way we've probably not seen a game do so since WoW was a cultural phenomona. Everyone talks about the next MMO but really the next MMO is probably going to be a UGC type game that takes off with all sorts of crowds across multiple demographics."	0107cd113c522566946bebf93220eee14f9a6e45	True	False					0	1658138194		0	{}	igmhgqi	False	t3_w0nb4j	False	True	t1_igi86rj	/r/ethereum/comments/w0nb4j/first_gameplay_footage_of_yugas_metaverse/igmhgqi/	1658138204	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

Yes, most Reddit subs are censored. Not news. 

&gt;if one of these appears on my sub, and only wants to disparage with insults, or to shame people and belittle people they will be removed.

This is called censoring, literally. If people don't want to listen to them, they can always block them. There's no need for you to censor them. 

&gt;No one has to spend their time arguing with this type of person, and should not have to. 

No one needs to argue with anyone else, except when physically forced to interact, which isn't the case, here. No one is ever forced to argue, here, it's all consentful.

You're very explicitely willing to censor people just because you subjectively consider they are trying to disparage or shame other people, thus preventing anyone else from accessing such content you censor. All while each person has the power to block any specific user and filter out the content.

And then you want to pretend that anything that comes from that censored sub should be called truth. If anything, I'd encourage you not to censor this sub and to change this sub name by creating another, more appropriate sub. If anything, because you may very well end up in a very uncomfortable position if that company finds anything that you sponsor, that you can't prove and which is a liability to them, as it means you could be forced by some courts to pay torts for such liability. Don't forget that Reddit messages have been and can be used against people in court. Even though it's completely nuts, it's the state of society, right now.

It provides a more fair market by ensuring different exchanges have similar prices as well as more liquidity on both buy and sell side. AMMs are only important if there will be tons of new assets issued to the ledger, which is the plan. In this case, each submarket no longer requires the need for personal arbitragers.
