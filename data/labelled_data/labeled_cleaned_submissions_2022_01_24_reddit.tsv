I made the same excuses as those who use it today back then about the fees being “not that bad”. 

I didn’t even realize that there was a mark up on Bitcoin’s market price on Coinbase for my first 3 years when I was doing so either that contributed to me getting way less Bitcoin for my dollars.

Like I said in the title, I could’ve had hundreds of thousands of more dollars in Bitcoin if I had used Coinbase Pro, known as GDAx at the time, instead of using Coinbase because it was easier to use.

The fees are a bitch in the long run vatos once you realize how much less Bitcoin they make you get. With Coinbase Pro being free too, there’s no reason not to use it and avoid the ten times more expensive fees on Coinbase, as well as their price mark up on Bitcoin’s price that they add on Coinbase.

My story is that I bought on Coinbase for my first 3 years before I finally sat down and did the math of the fees and up charge of Bitcoin’s market price on Coinbase compared to Coinbase Pro, which again is free to use. 

Look at the price they charge you on Coinbase and look at the price charts at the same time. The markup today is close to $300 dollars more than its market price at any given time. 

So had I bought on Coinbase Pro those first 3 years when I started, I’d have an extra six figures in returns today on top of what I’ve made over the years. That’s hundreds of thousands of extra dollars in Bitcoin that Coinbase had me miss out on thanks to my ignorance in not using Coinbase Pro instead, which at the time was called GDAX. 

It doesn’t seem like much in the present, but in the long run it’s a bitch of a missed opportunity that will burn you and make you which you could punch your early buyer self in the face.

Back in my day the mark up on Bitcoin’s market price was only $3 dollars so I didn’t think of it much like many who use Coinbase today don’t think about the price mark up much. When I switched to pro, the markup on Bitcoin’s market price was averaging $30 dollars. Today, the average Coinbase markup on Bitcoin’s price is close to $300 dollars

* Accepts small amounts ($20 USD)

Coinbase: refuses to accept my credit card (works fine everywhere else; PayPal, Amazon, etc).

Coincorner: has no option for USD (only EUR and GBP).

[Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com): extremely poor exchange rate.

Binance: unable to continue the verify process for my id card, because the page doesn't allow me to scroll down and press the Next button.

[Blockchain.com](https://Blockchain.com): Unable to register, got stuck in endless ""processing..."" messages.

Kraken: Unable to fill out verification form because the text is too small to read, and the page prevents me from zooming.

Moonpay: min amount $30.

Paybits: Phone verification code never arrived, even after many tries.

Worthless projects will die, but we will survive and move on. However, this is something I only lightly wanted to address and not what I wanted to discuss. 

Every cycle is different, with different quirks, but somehow it feels like so much of the spark, the excitement that was there for BTC that smacked people over the head was either lost, or drowned out, or something this time. Now don’t get me wrong, 2020-2021 was a year that had a lot of things I never thought we would see for a long time. We went from the days where my parents thought I was nuts talking about a weird “scam” used for illegal drug purchases, to public companies/countries adopting or buying BTC,  crossing the $1 Trillion mark, and some real widespread adoption overall. Some newer people were even able to make a pretty good return if they entered around 2020 or so. 
However, I’m starting to wonder if newer investors (relative term) will ever be able to experience the true magic it could feel like before. I remember when BTC blew people out of the water, when it almost seemed like the sky was the limit and no one knew when it was going to stop. At least that’s what it did too me. Sure slower healthier movements are better for the market and long term adoption, but to be honest, that magic crazy knock your socks off movement was part of the excitement for me. And yah, market cap size and so many other factors play into those explosive movements being more subdued, I’m not ignoring or deny that. But this cycle has felt so subdued and lackluster in having those real “wow omfg” moments (especially if entered in 2021) and I still hope that others are able to experience some of that magic. Yeah we will also trend back up again in time as well and put in a new ATH eventually. Maybe this is a stupid thing to reminisce or wonder about, who knows.

China's debt to GDP is above 250% and their real estate market bubble is starting to deflate. The US Federal Reserve has completely lost control over inflation despite their claims that everything is fine (40% of all USD was printed in the last 12 months, just think about that)

Long story short, governments are slowly losing control as bubbles deflate and retail begins to wake up. Antiwork is gaining traction and everyone is sick of rich assholes and government policy.

What does this mean for us? Honestly, things are looking extremely positive. Start paying off your debts (Dave Ramsey snowball method), keep stacking sats, and make sure to spend time with friends and family.

To put it plain and simple.

A lot have been written about Bitcoin nature as Digital Gold and an Inflation Hedge, or just a speculative asset.

These theories appear to be invalidated by this last week crash, some say Bitcoin is correlated with the NASDAQ, which is true, but not mutually excluyent with the fact that Bitcoin IS behaving as an Inflation Hedge. And at the same time, Bitcoin IS a speculative asset. 

The fact that Bitcoin is falling when the markets expect a rise in interest rates, is a proof of that. What consequence do rising rates have in economy? Theoretically, less inflation and a stronger dollar.

If that happens, then, again, theoretically, there is no reason to have as much Bitcoin (inflation hedge) as before, when the market expected (2020 and beyond) a falling dollar and a rising inflation, as a result of the money printing. An in that scenario, everyone bought Bitcoin as a HEDGE.

Finally, the fact that Bitcoin is not only falling but crashing, is a proof that it is also a speculative asset.

Bitcoin long-run uptrend will keep going, but with a stronger dollar and less inflation (at the least that’s what the market expects; I don’t think that a shy rise in rates can contain inflation) in the mind of the investors, we can’t expect crazy bullruns from Bitcoin in the short term.

What YOU think can be different, but definitely, the big capitals and institutions are expecting rising rates, a stronger dollar and less inflation."

What YOU think can be different, but definitely, the big capitals and institutions are expecting rising rates, a stronger dollar and less inflation."	bitcoin is behaving as an inflation hedge and here are my reasons bitcoin is behaving as an inflation hedge to put it plain and simple a lot have been written about bitcoin nature as digital gold and an inflation hedge or just a speculative asset these theories appear to be invalidated by this last week crash some say bitcoin is correlated with the nasdaq which is true but not mutually excluyent with the fact that bitcoin is behaving as an inflation hedge and at the same time bitcoin is a speculative asset the fact that bitcoin is falling when the markets expect a rise in interest rates is a proof of that what consequence do rising rates have in economy theoretically less inflation and a stronger dollar if that happens then again theoretically there is no reason to have as much bitcoin inflation hedge as before when the market expected 2020 and beyond a falling dollar and a rising inflation as a result of the money printing an in that scenario everyone bought bitcoin as a hedge finally the fact that bitcoin is not only falling but crashing is a proof that it is also a speculative asset bitcoin long run uptrend will keep going but with a stronger dollar and less inflation at the least that s what the market expects i don t think that a shy rise in rates can contain inflation in the mind of the investors we can t expect crazy bullruns from bitcoin in the short term what you think can be different but definitely the big capitals and institutions are expecting rising rates a stronger dollar and less inflation 	0.0022189663723111153	0.9887110590934753	0.4725399613380432	0.021885747089982033	0.007553633768111467	0.24523647129535675	0.10149994492530823	8.407868108406547e-07	0.42420515418052673	0.007189699448645115

Second, excess capital has also been taking on unprecedented levels of risk in search of yield, pumping investment values to extreme levels.  Consider the current valuation of the stock market across four key valuation indicators in historical context.  This is Bearish.

https://preview.redd.it/ajty74jyagd81.jpg?width=3131&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e8f91d0781d703c5958e0d6120b4452a9434423

Note the rocket-like trajectory of valuation coming out of the initial pandemic crash and coinciding with the rapid increase of the money supply.  Note the extreme downside risk implicit in a reversion to mean.  Why would anyone continue to take on that kind of risk in the pursuit of even more upside to these already crazy valuations?  Especially given the Fed's recent announced accelerated interest rate increases that will better reward hodling, better protect the value of money by hopefully curbing inflation, and is basically throwing in the towel that the productive economy will be able to grow at a rate that would justify these kinds of valuations.

So where does that leave us bitcoiners?  Unfortunately, we are being disabused of the notion that BTC is currently consensus seen as a secure store of value, but is rather consensus viewed as speculative growth tech.  I believe this upcoming period of time will be critical.  BTC is acting somewhat like a canary in the coal-mine for the economy overall, and the bloodbath price action we are seeing in it right now will spread more aggressively to other areas.  The big test will be when the shit really hits the fan everywhere in a period of protracted pain.  That is when the consensus view will swing or be confirmed, and when the value of bitcoin will be realized or lost.

I have been stacking and hodling BTC since 2017 and will continue to do so.  But it's going to continue to be a wild ride."

Hi everyone.  I see a lot of concerned comments from folks in the community lately wondering what's going on with Bitcoin price, and a lot of responses that try to explain things either through references to external events in the news cycle, chart analysis, whale activity, wild leaps of conspiracy theory, or flat-out trolls that BTC is dead.

I'd like to see if we can't crowdsource a more macro-economic narrative, backed by data and reasonable hypotheses, to add to the discussion.  I don't claim that any of what follows is infallible or the best way to look at things; but it is hopefully a decent place to start the conversation.

This is a 5-year view of the M2 money supply, consumer spending and real (inflation-adjusted) production, in aggregate dollars:

A few things here.  A massive increase to the money supply beginning with the onset of the pandemic in response to cratering consumer spending and overall productivity.  Recovery is fairly sharp.  Consumer spending is actually materially up versus an imagined and extended pre-pandemic trend line.  Real GDP is roughly on trend.  Money supply, however, is up 40% from pre-pandemic levels, and about 26% from the accelerated trend-line we see starting in about 2019.  **The question is:  if all of this excess money is not driving expanding productivity or increased consumption, where is it going?**

We see the need for this question also if we look at what's happened to the velocity of money, because it's certainly not being transacted at its usual rate.  This is Bearish.

Note the rocket-like trajectory of valuation coming out of the initial pandemic crash and coinciding with the rapid increase of the money supply.  Note the extreme downside risk implicit in a reversion to mean.  Why would anyone continue to take on that kind of risk in the pursuit of even more upside to these already crazy valuations?  Especially given the Fed's recent announced accelerated interest rate increases that will better reward hodling, better protect the value of money by hopefully curbing inflation, and is basically throwing in the towel that the productive economy will be able to grow at a rate that would justify these kinds of valuations.

So where does that leave us bitcoiners?  Unfortunately, we are being disabused of the notion that BTC is currently consensus seen as a secure store of value, but is rather consensus viewed as speculative growth tech.  I believe this upcoming period of time will be critical.  BTC is acting somewhat like a canary in the coal-mine for the economy overall, and the bloodbath price action we are seeing in it right now will spread more aggressively to other areas.  The big test will be when the shit really hits the fan everywhere in a period of protracted pain.  That is when the consensus view will swing or be confirmed, and when the value of bitcoin will be realized or lost.

I have been stacking and hodling BTC since 2017 and will continue to do so.

This is what is preventing me from going balls deep into BTC right now. Otherwise fear is high so it's a great time to buy more.

I mean if BTC was a ledger shared between 10 friends with an agreed price of 1$ = 1BTC, settled monthly. We all know there is no way to alter that shared ledger. But there still can be a bad friend who never pays his monthly share or pays just half of what he is owed. When he does that, the dollar value of all other people's 'Bitcoins' goes down. 

If translated to a market level this is what is happening right now. Except there was never an agreed value of a BTC.

I know it doesn't matter if BTC turns into a global currency with a stable price. But what would that stable price be? Why will it remain stable? When can it be expected to be reached?

Another pet peeve of mine is when people associate the mining cost of Bitcoins with its value. Just because something is hard to obtain doesn't automatically makes it valuable. 

I want to know your thoughts on these issues. I am new to crypto so please correct any misconceptions I may have."

I generated a couple through bigWallet and sent $1 to one and $100 to the other. Then when I went to go sweep I realized that it’s not easy- I haven’t found one mobile wallet that I can sweep my paper wallet into. I have found many apps have the option to Import though. But even with that every app asks me for the seed phrase. Well, I didn’t have the option to create a seed phrase on bitWallet and I just thought that having your private key was enough to get your funds out of a wallet.

The other day I was learning how to generate paper wallets. I generated a couple through bigWallet and sent $1 to one and $100 to the other. Then when I went to go sweep I realized that it’s not easy- I haven’t found one mobile wallet that I can sweep my paper wallet into. I have found many apps have the option to Import though. But even with that every app asks me for the seed phrase. Well, I didn’t have the option to create a seed phrase on bitWallet and I just thought that having your private key was enough to get your funds out of a wallet.

Why would we expect Bitcoin to increase in price over the next 10-15 years, and not slow and steadily decline before being put out of existence?

I've followed Bitcoin for years, and know quite a lot about it's strengths such Andreas Antonopoulos' ""The Five Pillars of Cryptocurrency"". I also know that that a lot of rich individuals, companies (like MicroStrategy) and even countries (like El Salvador) it buying bitcoin, but still I see some risk factors that makes me question bitcoin's future:

1. As we have some very big whales such as Max Kaiser which can probably move and manipulate the market for decades to come, why would even more countries and such move to bitcoin and risk being at the mercy of such individuals?
2. Despite bitcoin's superb, unique qualities (ref the five pillars) which does solve some real problems for real people (especially in developed countries), why would we assume that Bitcoin will continue to be the crypto dominating this space, and not being replaced by another crypto for this segment of bitcoin users? I mean, bitcoin is great and all, but being the first (and as of now the biggest) in the market for say hedging against government induced hyperinflation, doesn't mean it will stay this way.
3. If you subscribe to the notion that fiat money per definition is doomed due to inflation and government control, it's possible that bitcoin will remain an investing hedge by (wealthy) individuals and companies, and not become the money of the future. If so, it's possible that bitcon remains just a regular investment asset along side stocks and so forth.

I'll stop there, but I hope you see where I'm going with this.

What is this token all about?

It’s inspired by the game Flappy bird. The creators of Flappy Inu believe combining gaming and crypto will become the future of gaming. In preparation for this, they are aiming to bring back the popular game flappy bird with a few Shiba-like modifications. The flappy bird in the game for example is a Shiba bird. It is an intelligent strategy employed to market video games and crypto together in a subtle but intriguing way. The game is now available on their website.

Now what?

Here is a direct quote from their white paper “On a smaller scale Flap aims to develop the most popular decentralized crypto gaming ecosystem, FlapWorld, where Flap will be the main currency”. Users will be able to access features and levels within the game by holding Flap and NFTs created by Yoshi and the team”. They have multiple developments and a lot of bold claims. They say you are going to be able to connect your wallet to the game and if you hold certain tokens the game will change by adding new levels and features. Which I think is pretty cool.

How is it not a scam?

On their website, they have posted the burn of half their supply on Etherscan. They have burnt their LP tokens and have posted on their website the Etherscan link. Essentially ensuring that it is impossible to rug pull. They also go into great detail on how they are transparent on their whitepaper. Saying everything they do will be public and the community will have a say.

What is my opinion?

I think the creators have created something special. Flappy Inu has a fun and intriguing platform to attract users of all backgrounds. Staying ahead of the future trends in gaming and crypto is hard, but not impossible. Flappy Inu presents a relatively easy low-risk opportunity to get ahead of the curve as there is a particularly large market for gaming tokens like Flappy Inu to grow exponentially as crypto does. Finally, who doesn't love a flappy Shiba bird?"

As a huge gamer and crypto novice I see a ton of potential for cryptocurrency to be used in games, either with NFTs or just crypto tokens fueling a game economy.

I have had trouble finding a good source of knowledge on what games are out there. I have found some, which I will list below, but figured this would be

a good place for people to shill their favorite crypto games so we can give them a look!

Polker Games : Polker Game is the first blockchain based, Free to Play &amp; Play to Earn, Poker NFT that uses Unreal Engine 4 for immersive

and powerful gameplay while utilizing a provably fair system and TRNG technology. Polker Game plans to launch on platforms such as iOS, Android,

Windows, and streamings platform with intended support for next-gen VR, with stunning 3D characters, visual effects, and environments. Although, It Hasn't Launched Yet.

LEGENDS OF ELUMIA: Legends of Elumia is a next generation, Play to Earn, Massively Multiplayer Online RPG (MMORPG) developed by a large, experienced team of game developers.

Cryptoroyale - Harmony ONE ecosystem

Faucet .io-type game where you control a little circle and doot around getting bigger or bouncing off your opponents draining their essence

My favorite due to its zero barrier to entry, simply go to the browser and start playing

Community is great and active discord, devs care about feedback and are adding good updates regularly

Splinterlands - HIVE ecosystem

NFT trading card game

Large barrier to entry (not AXIE level large, but getting there) there are some free cards but to rank up you have to meet arbitrary ""power level"" requirements which can be quite expensive to reach

Some good design decisions which makes net-decking less powerful (randomized game modifiers)

I would love to get in on the ground floor of a good game developed with crypto as a feature rather than the main design element of the game.

What games have you found that you like or think have good potential? Do We have any Active Crypto Games Group or Discord Channel? Would love to Join that.

**My Main Question is Are you the going to Replace the Traditional Games?**

Another thing is How we choose or suppose that This game is best in crypto, As every game is giving NFT's and Tokens these days and it is not sure if some games is giving free NFT's then they are good."

After the merge, splurge, verge, surge, all that jazz, when Ethereum's roadmap is fully complete, what will it's finality time be?

With a 6.4 minute epoc time, will we need to wait 2.5 epocs as I've seen before?  I'm wondering what Ethereum's final form will be and if we will still be waiting 15 minutes to consider a transaction final.

I'm extremely bullish on ETH, but if it's finality will never be under 15 minutes, there HAS to be other chains who will thrive with fast finality times.  In my opinion if this is the case, it confirms that the future is multi-chain.  Are there other solutions on Ethereum that I'm not aware of?

I thought nothing of it, oh I'll just call back later. I went to take a sip of coffee, then I was struck with an idea. Now here I am beginning to write this article, alone, with my thoughts and feelings. I mean my dog is here too. My dog and I, and my coffee. Noice. Anyways..

&amp;#x200B;

So I have been in the crypto space since 2019 and was using [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) before they got all these like brand deals and did these collabs with all these industries. Back when you had to stake MCO to upgrade, (which I never was able to upgrade to Ruby because I guess I didn't do it right and it was in the middle of them switching to CRO, whatever), was doing stonks, forex, options, but nothing has ever helped or made me more happy than Crypto. All the jobs I worked at, I was always talking about crypto or the blockchain, And any job I work at I take a certain percentage of each check and buy BTC (starting to buy ETH more since I've been getting into NFTs) because I am big bullish on crypto and I am very excited for the future of crypto. That leads me to my next point. Working in the crypto market/community would be a fuckin dream come true. I do not like ""Fiat' anymore. I want to be bank-less. Cash is trash. The Feds are just printing money like nothing and there's people out there going hungry and we get taxed on literally everything. Savings accounts, 401k, stocks, ""fiat"" are trash, in my opinion of course (calm down keyboard warriors, I'm not here for a debate, save it) and I do not want to work somewhere that restricts me in being me and being a creative. It would be consistent yes which anybody can agree would be the better option, but so is the crypto space. More and more projects and communities are being built everyday. I am actually working on my first hand drawn NFT collection right now, one of many. Being able to network and collab with the crypto/NFT community full time would be great, it would literally change my life. I'd be able to die happy knowing I made a difference in society and the economy just being in the cryptospace and clear up all the confusion and common misconceptions about crypto and NFTs.

&amp;#x200B;

With all that being said, I am looking for a potential job in the cryptospace. I am looking to work for experience and later, paid in BTC or ETH. I have some coding experience, been drawing since I was in grade school, and I can pick things up fairly quickly. I do have a lengthy (outdated) resume because I had to move around a lot, unfortunately. Introvert who likes to think 3 moves ahead, sometimes overthinking a little too much. Like to be the first one there, last one to leave. I can do anything, if I don't know how to do it I will learn. I am not afraid of a challenge and do not use the words ""I can't"" I do not believe in them. I am still in the process of updating my resume it's way outdated, but I've been waiting over two weeks for a background check from a company that I really don't like. I quit my last job because it literally felt like I was wasting my time and skills. Got scheduled an interview literally the next day and got sent an offer same day because the hiring manager was hyped that I was applying there and wanted to hire me ASAP but said I have to do the background check which should only take like 3-4 days.. 5 days max. But 16 days?? (11 business days) for a background check? C'mon now.. I do have the Wonolo and Veryable app too so I can make some extra bucks here and there. I want to do this for the experience, the networking, the community, the hype, the future of crypto, and for the people. I want to contribute in any way, shape or form that I can in helping the economy and making this a better place. Any NFT projects you working on that you need help with? Or maybe a company that needs talent. Something, anything. If I'm gonna be trading my time for money, then I at least want it to be crypto related or paid in crypto. I can send an updated resume by Wednesday, Jan. 26th. Thank you for your time.

**TLDR**:

Option contracts are a way to hedge against volatility (price movement) in the market. Other ways include futures contract and swapping.

In general, higher volatility means higher risk because prices move more. That affects people's demand for option prices. Form options contracts, we can also tell how bullish or bearish the market is.

**Get smart:** Options are a tool that can be used to hedge against risks or to bet in the market. Difficult tool, but powerful when used right.

**Get smarter:** CeFi options for crypto exists. And DeFi options protocols are coming right up.

# General Conclusion

2 types of volatility — external volatility (aka market) and implied volatility (aka internal). They are useful factors when understanding your assets.

**FactorsBeyond Volatility**

Volatility is not the only thing you should care about when looking at your (crypto) assets. Also note the other data and factors.

* Micro Economy: Inflation of assets
* Macro Ecosystem: Market Conditions. Market could change and that affects the assets.
* Past Data: Beyond micro and macro markets it's also good to look at historical data to look at past data to get some reference and understanding. Note: *Past data does not define future performance*

**Historical Volatility vs Implied Volatility**

There are two types of volatility. One is the market volatility and the other is implied volatility. In a very simple way it's basically historical volatility and future volatility.

**Historical volatility:** It is based on past data and on all the information that is already given.

**Future volatility:** It is based on people's expectations of the assets and here you calculate based on how people pay for the expected assets.

**Higher Volatility = Higher Risk**

The general notion about volatility is that higher volatility = high risk.

Sometimes it is called educated gambling or educated speculation but **it's not always true**. The general notion of higher volatility means that the price will move more and when the prices move more, higher risk will be experienced. But it really depends on the trading strategy because that will help to mitigate different risks as when you have something with high volatility you can do something else to try and offset the risk or try to reduce that risk.

# What is Market Volatility?

&gt;It's a statistical measure of how ""spread"" is the value from the middle average. More spread (like a pancake) means higher volatility. Less spread (like a mountain) means lower volatilty.

1. **Uses Past Data:** It's historical volatility or using past data to get some understanding of where the asset is right now.
2. **Fluctuation of Returns:** It is the fluctuation (movement) of the returns of the prices of the assets. It is measured by measuring the spread of the returns so you can think of it as two bell curves. One bell curve is flat so almost like a very low middle line and it spreads out very widely like a pancake. You have another bell curve like the Mount Everest so it has a very high peak and everything is very narrow towards the peak.

 

**Why do we care?**

These values give us two main information:

1. **Market sentiment:** It is something like the better volatility where we try to figure out what the market is thinking about and how it compares to other assets
2. **Historical spot price:** It is how the asset itself is doing

**FactorsBeyond Volatility**

Volatility is not the only thing you should care about when looking at your (crypto) assets. Also note the other data and factors.

* Micro Economy: Inflation of assets
* Macro Ecosystem: Market Conditions. Market could change and that affects the assets.
* Past Data: Beyond micro and macro markets it's also good to look at historical data to look at past data to get some reference and understanding. Note: *Past data does not define future performance*

**Historical Volatility vs Implied Volatility**

There are two types of volatility. One is the market volatility and the other is implied volatility. In a very simple way it's basically historical volatility and future volatility.

**Historical volatility:** It is based on past data and on all the information that is already given.

**Future volatility:** It is based on people's expectations of the assets and here you calculate based on how people pay for the expected assets.

**Higher Volatility = Higher Risk**

The general notion about volatility is that higher volatility = high risk.

Sometimes it is called educated gambling or educated speculation but **it's not always true**. The general notion of higher volatility means that the price will move more and when the prices move more, higher risk will be experienced. But it really depends on the trading strategy because that will help to mitigate different risks as when you have something with high volatility you can do something else to try and offset the risk or try to reduce that risk.

# What is Market Volatility?

&gt;It's a statistical measure of how ""spread"" is the value from the middle average. More spread (like a pancake) means higher volatility. Less spread (like a mountain) means lower volatilty.

1. **Uses Past Data:** It's historical volatility or using past data to get some understanding of where the asset is right now.
2. **Fluctuation of Returns:** It is the fluctuation (movement) of the returns of the prices of the assets. It is measured by measuring the spread of the returns so you can think of it as two bell curves. One bell curve is flat so almost like a very low middle line and it spreads out very widely like a pancake. You have another bell curve like the Mount Everest so it has a very high peak and everything is very narrow towards the peak.

 

**Why do we care?**

These values give us two main information:

1. **Market sentiment:** It is something like the better volatility where we try to figure out what the market is thinking about and how it compares to other assets
2. **Historical spot price:** It is how the asset itself is doing
