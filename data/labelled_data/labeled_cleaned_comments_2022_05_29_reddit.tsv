Satoshi always intended for Bitcoin to work this way. Total anonymity on the main chain is a dangerous game.  Here's a reason why: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident


If you want to keep some (or all of) your purchases anonymous, have a look at second layer solutions like Liquid or Lightning.  

 r/TheLightningNetwork is awesome and really easy to use even for newcomers. If you never tried it, install a non custodial wallet like [Muun](https://muun.com/) or/and [Phoenix](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) and play with them a bit.

Some exchanges including [CoinCorner](https://coincorner.com/) are already using LN, many promised to implement it ASAP. 

If you're a fan, you can even built your own node and open/close channels yourself and well as rerouting payments for others and earn some extra sats.
Talking about, the majority of your payments will go over more than one hop on the network. It's next to impossible to link the receiving sats back to you. 

If using a privacy coins is like looking for a needle in a haystack, using LN is like looking for a needle in a haystack made of needles. Reason? User base. LN has already over 30,000 nodes on, over 80,000 open channels, much more users than all the privacy coins all together.

Download Tails (https://tails.boum.org/) and run it from a DVD or USB-drive.

Refrain from connecting to any network.

Create an Electrum wallet. Make two seed backups (paper, metal, brain,...), because Tails is an amnesiac system, meaning it will forget all settings, including your seed, upon reboot.

Here are old but very explanatory videos of how cold storage with Electrum works:

* Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9K3CozQpzM
* Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK4JmfMCDBg (redundant, because Tails exists)
* Part 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBVyFRb6ZZc

Tip: If you're using an Android device (a $50 tablet is enough) as your online-connected watch-only device, you can very handily transport unsigned and signed transactions between the laptop and the Android device using QR-codes.

**ATTENTION:** The only legitimate source from which Electrum can be obtained is https://electrum.org. By using the Electrum installation that comes with Tails (https://tails.boum.org is the only legitimate place to obtain Tails from), you're introducing one possibly weak link into your setup. Same goes for downloading the Electrum app on Android. While the Google Play Store might be relatively secure, as is Tails, relatively secure, you do introduce another point of failure and trust. Learn how to download, verify and use the official Electrum releases from https://electrum.org. You can see Thomas Voegtlin's (the lead developer of Electrum) GPG-fingerprint in this video, where he is giving a lecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjYCXOyDy7Y.

But Here’s the rough steps off the top of my head: 


Optionally Download bitaddress.org zip file, run the extracted html file locally (you can also just run it from the site for learning, I’ve monitored incoming and outgoing connections from there in the past when generating an address so I know it’s safe to do it live)

select “single wallet” &gt; generate address &gt; Print that 

Send a small amount to the address that reads SHARE, that’s the deposit address

You can then Verify the funds got to and confirmed it by scanning the QR code and copy pasting the address into a block explorer like blockchain.info or blockchair.com

Then go Sweep it back into a  software wallet by scanning the private key, the one that reads SECRET, (for that the ios wallets coinomi, bitcoin .com wallets work very well, exodus has a wallet sweep function as well. In coinomi for example you’d just setup a new BTC wallet, then there’s a “sweep wallet” option on upper right hand corner, just point the camera at the private key on the paper wallet and that’s all. (Keep in mind sweeping a paper wallet is it’s own transaction so whatever the current network fee that will apply), the bitcoin dot com one you’d just click the scan icon and point it at the private key and follow the steps it asks you

Once swept, try sending that funds back out of the software wallet to the paper wallet, then maybe repeat the above steps another time until you feel comfortable with the process to store  larger amounts 

When you’re finally ready to send larger amounts I’d generate a new address key pair and not use the one you’ve been testing with.

But after buying some at 15K, then for a year watching it sit at 3k-ish, then all of a sudden it's 69k,  IDK, 30K is not horrible.  I don't think it will go much lower, there is too much corporate money involved now, so i still expect to retire well in 20 years.  I'll throw a few Ben's here and there, but, if it is gonna be what it's supposed to be eventually, my .25 will suit my retirement just fine. 

I woulda drank that money anyway. So no biggy.  Not like you need to dump your life savings in.  My same thoughts were with GME/AMC a couple yrs ago,  i figured, why not, here's a double-digit of shares just for shits and giggles.

I don't do vegas or any gambling much,  same difference i guess, to me, but, really what's a couple-few grand on something that has the potential at least?  

I dont even talk about it with anyone, fam, friends, etc, maybe a few here and there, but not shilling to anyone.  

It either will or it wont... The ones dumping everying and risking everything are a little silly in my opinion.

The single remaining holder would be able to buy the safe in the liquidation auction, use their RAI to immediately clear its debt, and withdraw the ETH. This gives them the opportunity to get a fair price for their RAI, paid for out of the ETH in the safe.

&gt; Another extreme case worth examining is where RAI becomes the primary appliation on Ethereum. In this case, a reduction in expected future demand for RAI would crater the price of ETH. In the extreme case, a cascade of liquidations is possible, leading to a messy collapse of the system. But RAI is far more robust against this possibility than a Terra-style system.

My transaction definitely looks the same as you: My Polygon-WETH was sent to the null address with the `withdraw()` call (same as you), but on the Ethereum side on I got all that ETH back with an `exit()` call

So I think you're missing the second `exit()` call on Ethereum mainnet. From my understanding the Polygon transaction burns the WETH and issues a receipt that gets sync'd to mainnet that lets you withdraw the actual ETH to mainnet with that `exit()` call. Maybe there's been an issue with the UI that didn't let you initiate that second transaction from mainnet.

&gt;For each individual transaction that a miner includes, the costs are borne not just by that miner, but by every single node in the entire network. The cost per transaction is tiny; a miner can process a transaction and include it in a block for less than $0.00001 worth of electricity and data storage. The reason why transaction fees need to be high is because that $0.00001 is being paid by thousands of nodes all around the world.

Basically the miner gets all the fee revenue, but every participant in the network pays for it: That transaction used some bandwidth while in the mempool, it's added history that every node has to store, it's added state bloat that makes it harder to sync for everyone, etc. These ""computational load"" costs are abstract and tiny for each transaction, but still non-zero and they add up. But for the miner who's only interested in making money, bundling an extra transaction with a tiny fee in his block costs him basically nothing. If there's extra space in the block, then it still makes sense to include that transaction even if it's only a tiny fee barely above the ""basically nothing"" cost of including it.

He then explores other solutions to price transactions more fairly by considering burning some kind of a basefee. interesting innit"	16161e50f595c7cf67cf4f3740927721e6a41e35	True	False					0	1653705954		0	{}	ia9r45a	False	t3_uyxlzi	False	True	t3_uyxlzi	/r/ethereum/comments/uyxlzi/can_someone_explain_how_to_make_sense_of_this/ia9r45a/	1653705973	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

Starkware has a whole bunch of systems and completed $100m round of investment based on an $8bn valuation. There value went up 4x in 1 yr. why? Because of the deal with GameStop. Looprings fair value should be at least $10 really. Why? Because if ethereum is the financial system of the future it’s massively undervalued by as much as 10x minimum I’d say. As such if L2s are the scaling solution, loopring should be 10x to more or less directly correlate. Chances are however it could do far better than that as it corners market share in the crypto space due to the userbase exploding. We won’t see anything like that level of uptake with Polygon/other L2s for at least 1-2 yrs which is how long it’s currently taken for GameStop to get this far… so ultimately I think loopring will do very well. 10x-100x seems perfectly reasonable to me over the next yr or two	cd20a886d88484d140692d32ba8b88080fb485e9	True	False					0	1653700828		0	{}	ia9hdly	False	t3_uz8dp0	False	True	t1_ia9ft3w	/r/ethereum/comments/uz8dp0/l2s_are_a_great_medicine_for_scalability_but_they/ia9hdly/	1653700845	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

Today he’s promoting zk proofs as a solution to scalbility and a zk evm protocol. Loopring is a centralised organisation. Polygon is a centralised organisation. Ex ceo of loopring has now started a decentralised zk solution. I’m sure vitalik is in the loop or will be soon. I mostly follow loopring as I believe it’s a superior chain with greater potential than polygon given its partnership with GameStop and an ex loopring employee working at GameStop to promote it.	c22a85019432e4eb0ff0f5331ad5694adff05ac4	True	False					0	1653698460		0	{}	ia9cx85	False	t3_uz8dp0	False	True	t1_ia9ay0q	/r/ethereum/comments/uz8dp0/l2s_are_a_great_medicine_for_scalability_but_they/ia9cx85/	1653698473	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]
