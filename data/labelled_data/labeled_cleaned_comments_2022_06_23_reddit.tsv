Actually, it's the other way around and it's way overdue that we're finally getting away from the rich to get richer.

In PoW, you have several economies of scale that allow big farms and pools to earn proportionately much more, for any given amount invested by miners, than small miners. Be it in smaller prices for mining equipment, fine tuned equipment, cheaper electricity costs, lower latency to propagate their valid blocks before others and such, it's all economies of scale big farms have over small miners. 

In PoS, everyone gets to earn exactly the same amount of reward proportionately to what they invested. The only difference is a concentration of risks increasing the costs of biggest stakers, which means a diseconomy of scale.

&gt;Imagine this. What if a company owns all the tokens, they basically control all of the staking pools.

I already answered, but I can explain it more deeply: if they ever misbehave, they get forked away by the L0 consensus, aka the rest of the network. It means they lose all their tokens and all their power over the chain while the chain continues as before, but without them. And they have no way to prevent that except behaving well. 

But if anyone wants to behave well while staking many validators in a resilient way, they'd do a huge service to everyone else, as staking doesn't provide much benefit when you're staking millions of ETH: if they stake enough, it can even go as low as 3%. 

&gt;Add to that the the project governance, and the company runs all the full nodes.

Absolutely no one, whatever their funds, can prevent others from running a full node.

&gt;Lido already owns over 80% of the Ethereum staked pool market.

I guess you mean 30%, not 80%. Please, check your numbers. 

&gt;Fear yes, irrational no. I haven’t even touched on any of my talking points yet but I am drunk

It mainly depends on the harm/abuse. 

As of now and given that states monopolize the service of law, if it's about criminal activities, you complain to your local police station, as always. The fact you've been abused by someone else has nothing to do with any decentralized platform. That person is an abuser regardless of the platform(s) it uses.

The platform only is a facilitator. You could have very well got that drive or that home rent without the platform. It has no purpose to censor its actors in any way and providers as well as clients are fully liable for any illegal activity they decide to engage in.

Now, if it's about receiving a lack of service, like in what's generally handled for a contractualized service not followed as promised in the contract, you can use decentralized courts. AragonCourts already does that, notably. For the moment, it only provides service to DAOs (as far as I know, I didn't check recently), but there's no reason it can't provide service to users of any decentralized platform.

The court then decides whenever there is a conflict and the decision is automatically enforced to any stake users and providers have put into the service. Optionally, insurances can be used to provide stakes and pay any damage whenever appropriate."	2b8125253813039f9cdbffd401a15503357f9659	True	False					0	1655877422		0	{}	id9v1w4	False	t3_vhscdb	False	True	t1_id9u2q5	/r/ethereum/comments/vhscdb/i_feel_like_no_one_outside_of_our_industry/id9v1w4/	1655877439	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

E.g, Uber is a functionality that can be replaced by Blockchain - I’m sure there’s a coin/the technology exists for this. A rider and a driver both use Blockchain to facilitate a transaction. 

However, say a driver harms/abuses a driver. Who does the rider ‘complain’ to ? Legally, who is responsible for representing the driver and rider. 

I think a better example is Airbnb, which again are a middleman business that can be replaced by Blockchain. If I go into an apartment which is severely under quality, who do I report this to, to get my money back?

Debunked by anyone, here by me, with arguments you didn't have anything against. Whoever provides arguments isn't how you value an argument. The argument itself is its own value. Being right or wrong doesn't depend of who it is but only on what is said. 

Nothing in an authority provides value to an argument. If anything, an authority that has provided much effort into exploring its expertise should be expected to be able to provide solid arguments due to all the efforts it spent for it. The lack of solid arguments coming from an expert necessarily is a Bayesian argument against the thesis it defends."	f735fe1ab516ac040e65e8f6c0982106b9faa6b1	True	False					0	1655873757		0	{}	id9pu3k	False	t3_vhuq3c	False	True	t1_id9nsky	/r/ethereum/comments/vhuq3c/vitalik_buterin_discusses_the_advantages_of_proof/id9pu3k/	1655873770	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

3. Blocks are created by proposers who are validators randomly chosen by the protocol
4. Blocks are voted on by validators to determine if they are added to the chain

In Proof of Work the cost to attack the chain is somewhat equal to the electricity consumed to gain a majority hashpower share + the cost of rent/acquisition of mining equipment to do so. Once you have access to enough hash power, attacking Bitcoin is somewhat cheap as electricity is your only expense, and if you already have the mining hardware (like a mining pool) you can attack Bitcoin for like $1 million per hours. If 99% of Bitcoin miners dropped off, it wouldn't become 100X more difficult to mine Bitcoin, the mining difficulty would adjust so that a new blocks will continue to be found every 10 or so minutes. 

In PoS a validator is randomly selected to be a block proposer along with a committee who attest to the correctness of the blocks. Should these people lie, they will get their money deleted, but if they act all good and honest they get a small reward. In PoS the cost to attack the network is roughly 50% of the staked ETH, which currently amounts to something like $6.5 *billion*."	f77551e5d385753e7256fcfd7158eb045edf0168	True	False					0	1655911379		0	{}	idbbmi1	False	t3_vi6s8b	False	True	t3_vi6s8b	/r/ethereum/comments/vi6s8b/pos/idbbmi1/	1655911390	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

&gt;  
&gt;The plan was always to add extra functionality to shards, to make them more like the Ethereum Mainnet today. This would allow them to store and execute code and handle transactions, as each shard would contain its unique set of smart contracts and account balances. Cross-shard communication would allow for transactions between shards.

EVM: Ethereum Virtual Machine- basically the code engine inside Ethereum nodes/clients that processes smart contracts. If you think of smart contracts as applications, the EVM is like the operating system that runs them and interfaces with the ""hardware"" of the node network. Various chains have copied the EVM's code to allow for contract compatibility, including rollups. The transition to PoS does not directly affect the EVM, and most scaling upgrades will not directly affect it either, at least in regards to how it processes contract code. Some new transaction types may be added. 

Ethereum 2.0 isn't really a ""thing"" anymore, it's just the series of upgrades to the network planned for the next several years, the first of which is the Merge to PoS later this year. Switching to PoS will not have any significant effects on rollups or the EVM. 

The next iteration of upgrades is called ""sharding"" but as of right now it's not clear what form that will take. Originally, sharding was going to be separate execution chains with cross-communication capabilities, but it may turn out to not be necessary with the rollup-centric roadmap. The newer proposal is called ""danksharding"" which is intended to drastically scale the chain's data availability capabilities so that rollups can have extremely cheap transactions. This is very much an active area of research, so expect things to change!

The bottom line is that future upgrades are not going to make the EVM ""obsolete"" nor will they make rollups obsolete- they are only going to enhance them. As for alternate chains that have copied the EVM to use in their own node network, it's not clear what will happen in the long run. Many will likely die and become ghost chains like EOS or ETC, with negligible real activity. Some may see long-term adoption."	6e4223e2c4f1b686fe4b6ec63bd8f83fb2cd9d25	True	False					0	1655904139		0	{}	idavbmh	False	t3_vi3apm	False	True	t3_vi3apm	/r/ethereum/comments/vi3apm/what_happens_to_evms_and_layers_2s_after_ethereum/idavbmh/	1655904152	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

Rollups and L2s are not directly mined by validators and are considered Layer 2. The link you just posted LITERALLY says the same thing, that the Layer 1 Shards enable Layer 2 rollup scaling... I understand your confidence in understanding, but perhaps you should re-read through all of this stuff.	9815b3f92425afb7a7f39c476fb6f2e7a7e57ea3	True	False					0	1655903839		0	{}	idaupq9	False	t3_vi3apm	False	True	t1_idatsa2	/r/ethereum/comments/vi3apm/what_happens_to_evms_and_layers_2s_after_ethereum/idaupq9/	1655903856	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]
