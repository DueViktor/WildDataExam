Actually, it's the other way around and it's way overdue that we're finally getting away from the rich to get richer.

In PoW, you have several economies of scale that allow big farms and pools to earn proportionately much more, for any given amount invested by miners, than small miners. Be it in smaller prices for mining equipment, fine tuned equipment, cheaper electricity costs, lower latency to propagate their valid blocks before others and such, it's all economies of scale big farms have over small miners. 

In PoS, everyone gets to earn exactly the same amount of reward proportionately to what they invested. The only difference is a concentration of risks increasing the costs of biggest stakers, which means a diseconomy of scale.

&gt;Imagine this. What if a company owns all the tokens, they basically control all of the staking pools.

I already answered, but I can explain it more deeply: if they ever misbehave, they get forked away by the L0 consensus, aka the rest of the network. It means they lose all their tokens and all their power over the chain while the chain continues as before, but without them. And they have no way to prevent that except behaving well. 

But if anyone wants to behave well while staking many validators in a resilient way, they'd do a huge service to everyone else, as staking doesn't provide much benefit when you're staking millions of ETH: if they stake enough, it can even go as low as 3%. 

&gt;Add to that the the project governance, and the company runs all the full nodes.

Absolutely no one, whatever their funds, can prevent others from running a full node.

&gt;Lido already owns over 80% of the Ethereum staked pool market.

I guess you mean 30%, not 80%. Please, check your numbers. 

&gt;Fear yes, irrational no. I haven’t even touched on any of my talking points yet but I am drunk

It mainly depends on the harm/abuse. 

As of now and given that states monopolize the service of law, if it's about criminal activities, you complain to your local police station, as always. The fact you've been abused by someone else has nothing to do with any decentralized platform. That person is an abuser regardless of the platform(s) it uses.

The platform only is a facilitator. You could have very well got that drive or that home rent without the platform. It has no purpose to censor its actors in any way and providers as well as clients are fully liable for any illegal activity they decide to engage in.

Now, if it's about receiving a lack of service, like in what's generally handled for a contractualized service not followed as promised in the contract, you can use decentralized courts. AragonCourts already does that, notably.

You made a point that Blockchain is a viable replacement for ‘middlemen’ - I agree with this from the technological sense. 

However, how does Blockchain technologies address the ‘moderation’ aspects ?

E.g, Uber is a functionality that can be replaced by Blockchain - I’m sure there’s a coin/the technology exists for this. A rider and a driver both use Blockchain to facilitate a transaction. 

However, say a driver harms/abuses a driver. Who does the rider ‘complain’ to ? Legally, who is responsible for representing the driver and rider. 

I think a better example is Airbnb, which again are a middleman business that can be replaced by Blockchain. If I go into an apartment which is severely under quality, who do I report this to, to get my money back?

From the technological sense, Blockchain works. From the societal, legal sense , I’m not sure if we are there yet.

Debunked by anyone, here by me, with arguments you didn't have anything against. Whoever provides arguments isn't how you value an argument. The argument itself is its own value. Being right or wrong doesn't depend of who it is but only on what is said. 

Nothing in an authority provides value to an argument.

It absolutely would be. Imagine if you could see who's funding who in the government? Who's actually paying taxes versus avoiding them? How they're avoiding them? Who's paying child support for a secret bastard while projecting an image that condemns infidelity?

The world would absolutely be a better place with all that information on display. People would be able to make *far* more informed decisions, *especially* in the realm of trust.

1. You put coins at stake so that if you behave poorly or maliciously, the protocol can take something of value from you as punishment and also kick you out of validating
2. The coins at stake don't actually have anything to do with validation or block proposals, they're just the qualifier to allow you to participate
3. Blocks are created by proposers who are validators randomly chosen by the protocol
4. Blocks are voted on by validators to determine if they are added to the chain

&gt;Shard chains version 2: code execution  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The plan was always to add extra functionality to shards, to make them more like the Ethereum Mainnet today. This would allow them to store and execute code and handle transactions, as each shard would contain its unique set of smart contracts and account balances. Cross-shard communication would allow for transactions between shards.

EVM: Ethereum Virtual Machine- basically the code engine inside Ethereum nodes/clients that processes smart contracts. If you think of smart contracts as applications, the EVM is like the operating system that runs them and interfaces with the ""hardware"" of the node network. Various chains have copied the EVM's code to allow for contract compatibility, including rollups. The transition to PoS does not directly affect the EVM, and most scaling upgrades will not directly affect it either, at least in regards to how it processes contract code. Some new transaction types may be added. 

Ethereum 2.0 isn't really a ""thing"" anymore, it's just the series of upgrades to the network planned for the next several years, the first of which is the Merge to PoS later this year. Switching to PoS will not have any significant effects on rollups or the EVM. 

The next iteration of upgrades is called ""sharding"" but as of right now it's not clear what form that will take. Originally, sharding was going to be separate execution chains with cross-communication capabilities, but it may turn out to not be necessary with the rollup-centric roadmap. The newer proposal is called ""danksharding"" which is intended to drastically scale the chain's data availability capabilities so that rollups can have extremely cheap transactions. This is very much an active area of research, so expect things to change!

Great video on danksharding: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5p0TB77flM

The bottom line is that future upgrades are not going to make the EVM ""obsolete"" nor will they make rollups obsolete- they are only going to enhance them. As for alternate chains that have copied the EVM to use in their own node network, it's not clear what will happen in the long run. Many will likely die and become ghost chains like EOS or ETC, with negligible real activity. Some may see long-term adoption."	6e4223e2c4f1b686fe4b6ec63bd8f83fb2cd9d25	True	False					0	1655904139		0	{}	idavbmh	False	t3_vi3apm	False	True	t3_vi3apm	/r/ethereum/comments/vi3apm/what_happens_to_evms_and_layers_2s_after_ethereum/idavbmh/	1655904152	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		let s get some definitions straightened out evm ethereum virtual machine basically the code engine inside ethereum nodes clients that processes smart contracts if you think of smart contracts as applications the evm is like the operating system that runs them and interfaces with the hardware of the node network various chains have copied the evm s code to allow for contract compatibility including rollups the transition to pos does not directly affect the evm and most scaling upgrades will not directly affect it either at least in regards to how it processes contract code some new transaction types may be added ethereum 2 0 isn t really a thing anymore it s just the series of upgrades to the network planned for the next several years the first of which is the merge to pos later this year switching to pos will not have any significant effects on rollups or the evm the next iteration of upgrades is called sharding but as of right now it s not clear what form that will take originally sharding was going to be separate execution chains with cross communication capabilities but it may turn out to not be necessary with the rollup centric roadmap the newer proposal is called danksharding which is intended to drastically scale the chain s data availability capabilities so that rollups can have extremely cheap transactions this is very much an active area of research so expect things to change great video on danksharding https www youtube com watch v n5p0tb77flm the bottom line is that future upgrades are not going to make the evm obsolete nor will they make rollups obsolete they are only going to enhance them as for alternate chains that have copied the evm to use in their own node network it s not clear what will happen in the long run many will likely die and become ghost chains like eos or etc with negligible real activity some may see long term adoption 	0.0030311604496091604	0.9873929619789124	0.35603493452072144	0.9259315133094788	0.010117308236658573	0.22273340821266174	0.09298916906118393	8.455705255983048e-07	0.5103886723518372	0.012311102822422981
