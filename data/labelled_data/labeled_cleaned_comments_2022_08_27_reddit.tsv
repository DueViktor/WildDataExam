Why would they use a command line? No one prevented front end, just one centralized instance of it. All they've proven is they can't even prevent that. XD 

Here:

https://www.theshake.xyz/defi/

&gt;And the Treasury Department isn’t content with de facto filtering at the interface level.

Well, since they couldn't even succeed in that step, I guess it's completely moot.

&gt;The effects were immediate – Tornado became inaccessible to anyone except the highly motivated and foolhardy.

Excuse me?

&gt;Notably, Ethereum’s largest mining pool, Ethermine, has already incorporated filtering into its block construction.

Still accessible, so, again with a moot point? 

&gt;Brian Armstrong can posture all he likes, but the Board won’t allow him to shut down Coinbase’s massively lucrative staking business because some .eths were mean to him online – they would sooner fire him.

And the board would then be liable for having harmed their own investors by forcing a fork away of the stakes of their own clients. Brian's stance is the only legal one in this. 

If the board wants to be sued by their own investors, they'd provide to them a very easy case. 

&gt;Eric Wall has described the credible threat of slashing “a prerequisite for security and censorship resistance in a blockchain.”

Indeed. 

&gt;The first problem is, of course, that there’s no actual slashing rule on Ethereum.

That is forgetting that ""code is law"" actually means ""behavior is law"". Coinbase knows very well what they're meant to do and that they will be kept accountable for it by the stake they've put hostage to the chain. 

&gt;Any imposition of one – taking away staked tokens from validators – would be contrived and arbitrary, effectively unconstitutional.

That is a strong claim, and an unbacked one on top of it. Prove it.

Besides, ""unconstitutional"" is the motto when you're dealing with a consensus that is in no way subjected to any constitution, even less so the US one.

&gt;The very defensible DAO rollback (in 2016, following a $50 million hack) caused a mighty hangover that persuaded many that Ethereum was a hopelessly subjective mess, de facto controlled by a small group making things up on the fly.

First, it wasn't a rollback. Second, it wasn't a small group either, since each person had the full freedom to choose which branch to use and a majority has decided to choose ETH over ETC. Two dubious claims so easily proven wrong. Is that an article paper or is that toilet paper?

&gt;A newly imposed slashing rule spirited from thin air

Did someone just learn what PoS means? Was ""stake"" not a big enough hint? Would you prefer Proof of Hostage, for better clarity? Wow. 

&gt;Skeptics could justifiably point out that Ethereum will have completely surrendered the moral high ground, with leadership acting expediently.

Leadership? What leadership? Why did you need to use such false assumption? Was there no actual argument to provide that you had to rely on false assumptions? Wow. 

&gt;So Ethereum’s reaction to nation-state sanctions would be to impose sanctions of its own. It’s an identical desire to the one that drives the U.S. government to sanction so aggressively: to use purportedly surgical financial weapons to fight enemies, foreign and domestic, without firing a shot.

Absolutely not. Censorship-resistant mechanisms are neutral: it doesn't need any KYC, it doesn't need to know the identity of anyone, it shoots without requiring to make any assumption on identities. It only shoots down malevolent behaviors, regardless of wallets or people behind them. This paragraph shows a deep misunderstanding of what censorship-resistance is and how slashing works.

Slashing to protect censorship-resistance needs to be done, not because it's Coinbase, but rather even if it's Coinbase behind such malevolent behavior. And it needs to be applied onto anyone who adopts similar malevolent behaviors, regardless of who they are, even if it's Lido and even if it's Vitalik or anyone else.

&gt;Who measures consensus? Does Coinbase get an appeal? In which court?

Ethermine itself isn't the problem, because they aren't a majority preventing others from not censoring.

The problem is when they censor the rest of the consensus and prevent the rest of the consensus from providing the service they don't want to provide.

It would be very much like a 51% miner who decides to ignore any block he doesn't mine. It's an attack, by all standards. Likewise, if a group of validators starts censoring to the point they also ignore the blocks of others validators and they're a big enough group to completely shun these minority validators, it is an attack, by all standards.

Any lesser attempt doesn't censor transactions. And any such big attempt is an obvious attack. It has nothing to do with law or with any court. It is just how the L0 consensus will see it and how it will decide to fork away attackers. Ans they have the right to do so, because it's their self-sovereignty right to decide to all band together and ignore specific actors for their specific behaviors. It just happens that it's way easier for them to organize and band together because it's about malevolent behaviors.

&gt;These questions are unanswerable, given the vast array of Ethereum’s many stakeholders and their many different views.

It was pretty quickly answered, for unanswerable questions. XD

&gt;There is no socially scalable way to “slash only the bad people.” 

This is an unbacked claim. Prove it. 

&gt;In the real world, there are no such things as villains.

I'll ignore the completely false statement (serial killers don't exist anymore, I guess? ) and pretend it was meant way differently. 

Malevolence and mistakes exist in regard to a system with designated roles. But then, even when ignoring the obviously wrong part about villains not existing, this sentence is just an apology of unaccountable politicians. It's completely disgusting and irresponsible. 

&gt;There are only competing interests. Coinbase’s interest is to comply with the laws where it operates while running a profitable business.

Then they're to provide a different service, because it seems running the service they're trying to run is forbidden to them by law.

&gt;And as far as constitutionality is concerned

It can't be concerned, in any way.

&gt;but does not describe how the intent of an “attacker” might be assessed

That's because intent is never to be assessed in a trustless system. It's not a court, it's a trustless system. You misuse it, you're punished, even if you misused it with the best intents of the world. This is how negative externalities are properly handled.

&gt;It’s the same impulse that drives all campaigns of nationalization, expropriation and collectivization.

This is completely false. The impulse of these campaigns isn't based on malevolence being punished to ha dle negative externalities. The impulse of these campaigns is to drastically change management of resources to handle as a public good even though it's not a public good, supposedly because it would create less negative externalities. But it never handles past negative externalities in any way. And it handles as a public good while slashing continues to handle the system from an individual perspective. Slashing isn't about creating a big pool from the forked away tokens.

This is just a pure fallacy of trying to make it seem like it's about nationalizing when it's completely the opposite.

&gt;Countries that take a socialist turn and expropriate foreign firms for crimes real or imagined always suffer in the long term. Their nationalized industries end up becoming inefficient; no one wants to lend to them (as they have proven themselves unreliable) and no one is willing to invest there either.

Again with the same fallacy. The rest goes on and on with it. 

&gt;Simply remaining on proof-of-work (PoW) – this oughtn’t be taken as an endorsement of any fork – would likely abate the problem.

Oh, I see. So, you pretend big mining farms aren't even easier to spot and coerce than stakers? Prove it. Careful, China already proved you wrong. XD

&gt;Stake exposes consensus to government will through regulated financial institutions, which are slated to dominate validation, whereas PoW is far more distributed and covert.

And you pretend governments can't do the same with PoW? ""Oh, mining equipment! We're doomed!"" XD

&gt;Switching mining pools is instant and trivial; with PoS, it’s cumbersome.

No one pretends mining pools are the vulnerability of PoW. Big mining farms are. And they're much easier to spot and coerce.

&gt;In light of this state-level attack, I do question the prudence of the rushed move to PoS

Rushed? Really? Unashamed about that word, I guess? Wow.

&gt;To achieve genuine change, we must understand that in a common-law republic, laws are malleable, and can and do adapt to new realities on the ground.

No, solutions don't come from laws. Censorship comes from law. It's not a solution.

&gt;I’m optimistic that, whether legislatively or in the courts, we will eventually win.

You're just saying that we should not have any censorship-resistant tool and that we should instead talk really hard to make sure rulers accept not to censor. You're just asking for the leash to be there and never be used. It's not censorship-resistance in the slightest. It's still providing to any wannabe dictator full power over everyone, including their political opponents. That's irresponsible."	7de82924258a56dfff4ab73463c3c3043398876e	True	False					0	1661474525		0	{}	ilt4j8i	False	t3_wxsgit	False	True	t3_wxsgit	/r/ethereum/comments/wxsgit/if_ethereum_starts_slashing_it_burns/ilt4j8i/	1661474540	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

If you are using your private key in an online environment, it could conceivably be stolen by a hacker, although I can't tell you what the odds are.

When private keys are used like that, by internet-connected software, they are called ""hot wallets"" (I think that the term ""wallet"" is deceptive anyway but that's another issue). A ""cold wallet"" is just a way of storing a seed phrase or private key such that it isn't exposed to the Internet.

The ideal thing to do is create your transaction, sign it offline with your seed phrase, and then take the signed transaction and send it using your software.

Some ""wallets"" let you do that but I don't trust any of them personally except Electrum (which is for Bitcoin -- it's an excellent open source program). I am currently writing my own simple software to let me do offline signing for Ethereum on a Linux/Unix command line. If you or others are interested, I can post a link to the code on GitHub when I am finished. I am happy to open source it. It's a pity that offline signing is not more available.

You can also use a ""hardware wallet"" that connects to your computer via USB and does the signing in its own special and supposedly unhackable hardware.

Its literlly 12 dictionary words in random order; there is a good chance SOMEBODY (i.e. a computer) can guess SOMETHING valid over time. And if they do, they are instantly in.

Actually, no. It's extremely hard. It's so hard that finding a duplicate by sheer luck would be very crazy. Probably too crazy for this world. 

There are so many public keys that even trying to find a duplicate of any other one, trying a billion times a second for a billion years, even if you have a billion people trying to do this, wouldn't be enough to have even close to 1% chance of having 1 duplicate, because you'd only get 10 power 34 attempts when doing so. Even with a billion worlds all trying to do all that for all that time for as many people on each world (so, 10 power 43 attempts), you'd be far from reaching it. 

That's because public keys are encoded on 160 bits. Aka, there are more than 10 power 48 possibilities. It's a mind-blowingly big number and finding a duplicate is a mind-blowingly rare event. 

What you could have, though, is a biased random or even a seed that was already generated in code. That's notably what happens to people when they use hard coded test wallets as live wallets on main networks."	fc30a082ea33c0be535452529ea7537d39521059	True	False					0	1661492612		0	{}	ilu3bgs	False	t3_wy0d42	False	True	t3_wy0d42	/r/ethereum/comments/wy0d42/importing_seed_phrases_whats_stopping_somebody/ilu3bgs/	1661492624	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

What you're looking for is an asset that is not as volatile, not a stablecoin pegged to any fiat. 

The stablecoin pegged to fiat itself, after all, is just a way to ensure you're still fully suffering from monetary inflation and keeping an asset that decreases in value over time. We're not far from getting full percents down over some nights, right now, with some shops noticeably increasing their prices during some hopefully still very few days.

So, you could rather be receiving wealth in other assets, probably indexes over several other assets. 

Besides, you will still have an access, although a better one, to financial tools, including ways to get money beforehand. It won't change the fact people with very poor financial skills will make poor decisions, but it will ensure their products are way cheaper and have access to better decisions either directly or indirectly."	28351d1ee3edccbdff857e8eb15768b17f65187e	True	False					0	1661529618		0	{}	ilvv5np	False	t3_wxt31g	False	True	t1_iluc2b6	/r/ethereum/comments/wxt31g/ethereums_vitalik_buterin_urges_masses_to_embrace/ilvv5np/	1661529634	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

Or block validators can also batch user's transactions, 100 users broadcast a transaction, the next block producer puts them in as one. And yes, other chains can batch too. It's not a special ability of eutxo, eutxo is just utxo that allows smart contracts, and utxo is better than accounting model for determinism and paralelism. So they are some centralized middleman because it was batched by one person? That one person also made the block, so was the block centralized? Oh then every block is centralized? Same goes for bitcoin and we call it decentralized because it is, as more people then continue to validate the added blocks and add more. Yes, other chains can also batch transactions and all of them should do it more. batching them is good as they take less space than individually, so you can fit more of them into a single block, so the TPS goes up. Cardano will soon release Vasil which with reference inputs will further reduce the data bloat on transactions, so more will fit in per kilobyte, it will faster the networking, so you could expand block size, allowing even more transcations to fit in, and more speed upgrades are planned after that.	6733694db9fba7df8d8a647a5e0efa7ebe5ace96	True	False					0	1661479730		0	{}	iltfzty	False	t3_wvoxmu	False	True	t1_ils3qfk	/r/solana/comments/wvoxmu/solana_uses_2x_as_much_power_but_pushes_40x_as/iltfzty/	1661479744	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]

228	[]	False		_LinuxFTW_			[]				text	t2_92ysix0h	False	False	"As to your 1st point...

Block propagation time refers to the time it takes for the block in question to reach the next node.

Each of these nodes must put the proposed block through the consensus mechanism before passing it on to the next node.

Once the required amount of nodes receive the block, and confirm it...it's added to the chain.  

Therefor if we decrease the time it takes for the block to be passed around the consensus mechanism can happen faster, and the transactions within it are confirmed faster.

Even though tentatively a Tx can be confirmed after the 1st confirmation, newly added blocks remain mutable, they become permanent after between 15-30 confirmations, this is when you could consider the Tx complete.

Some centralized exchanges require differing numbers of confirmations before they'll let you trade with newly imported ADA, the same goes for certain crypto wallets where the Tx might be on-chain but not visible in your wallet yet until the preset confirmation number is reached...so this not exactly a SET number.

No matter what your preferred number is however, when we speed up block propagation times we also inevitably speed up the completion time of the transaction...or TPS, as the block and its contents were confirmed faster.

But again the way Tx's work in Cardano makes TPS a highly inaccurate metric to determine real life transaction speed. 

As to your second point...

Reference scripts are essentially chunks of code, a collection of the most commonly used chunks are now available to developers after they upgrade to 1.35.3 (Vasil Hard Fork).

This means devs can put the smart-contract on a diet if it shares functionality with any of these commonly used scripts.

The smaller the smart contracts, the more as can fit in one block as they are limited by a maximum block size, this is what I suspect you were referring to when mentioning an increase before Vasil...as this block size was also recently increased.

However...script references do not automatically increase TPS, the publishers of the smart-contract have to implement them in their code, and depending on the type of contract this might not make sense...NFT's being a likely example of unique code that does not always benefit from these scripts.

So in conclusion...

The decrease in block propagation times WILL increase (real-world) TPS, as it applies to all transactions regardless of the code used.

The addition of reference scripts POTENTIALLY increase (real-world) TPS, but don't do so by default, as the publisher must implement them."	e2273ffdabbbafe761a400e2faf058f86f1410a3	True	False					0	1661512349		0	{}	ilusq7l	False	t3_wvoxmu	False	True	t1_ilsttzl	/r/solana/comments/wvoxmu/solana_uses_2x_as_much_power_but_pushes_40x_as/ilusq7l/	1661512363	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]

That's how development should be going. Add a feature, then optimize it.

Cardano is stll in development, it's not a finished product yet, and it is being developed correctly.  
  
Alonzo added a new slow and correct feature, Vasil will speed the new feature up.  
  
I'm seeing this pattern my projects as well. Every new feature slows things down at the start, and then it gets optimized and you have a product that can do more and faster.  
  
The same pattern also goes for Widnows releases, NewFeatureBad-FixedBetter-NewFeatureBad-FixedBetter...

""First of all, are you telling me that millions of people will submit personal transactions on 1 single TX? If true then we have someone batching orders (middleman)""

I never said that\^...straw-man says hello.

And in my example I used 500 not millions, and if you take a second to think about the types of transactions that happen in bulk on-chain you'll realize that many of these can be attached to the same Tx.

For example...

Liquidity pool payouts, Yield farming payouts, Loan payments, CEX to CEX transfers, faucets/air drops, and ICO/ISPO token sales are some examples...almost every Tx type in defi can use this mechanism.

As for the congestion claim (a dishonest one)

The DEX congestion you're referring to, happened when those DEXes went live for the 1st time, which means they needed liquidity and offered amazing returns on yield farming to attract those liquidity providers...(I'm one of them).

So...many people aped into these DEXes chasing those yields, for Sundaeswap alone this was like 5k...not 1k like you claimed.

The above scenario is a one-time thing that happens when a DEX which implements liquidity pools launches for the 1st time.

Once the pools are filled this is no longer an issue, and to claim Cardano gets congested because of 2 DEXes is blatently dishonest.

Furthermore this was at a time when Cardano hadn't even reached the scalability stage in it's roadmap...the stage it's currently in, and which the Vasil Hard fork is a part of.

ATM Sundaeswap, Muesliswap (yes also has liquidity pools now), Minswap, Wingriders, Meowswap and Adax Pro are all live...and guess what...no congestion.

So to claim Cardano gets congested with 2 DEXes is just plain false.

As for the performance per watt mess...

Op claims Solana's is the best in this race, as he's comparing raw TPS numbers.

As mentioned before...doing this for a chain like Cardano results in the wrong performance per watt, as TPS is not so easily determined for Cardano.

I don't really know why you mentioned Charles talking about it, I don't really see the relevance as Charles talks about it in terms of comparing POS to POW, not as a TPS comparison as TPS is relative on Cardano...Charles knows this and often has to point this out.

BTW I'm seeing a few comments in response to my original including your's, and there seems to be a habit of equating Batching, Rollups, and Multisig, I'll happily get into this (get ready for some nerd-age) but these are NOT the same things, the way they work is different, and they are used for different use cases.

So no BTC and ETH cannot do the same, though BTC can do something similar as Cardano's eUTXO is based on BTC's UTXO."	20c5db23f5d6beea377e00ca13d6a850947f1ff1	True	False					0	1661516872		0	{}	ilv0tbv	False	t3_wvoxmu	False	True	t1_ils3qfk	/r/solana/comments/wvoxmu/solana_uses_2x_as_much_power_but_pushes_40x_as/ilv0tbv/	1661516888	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]

All blockchain txs require an input tx, regardless of the mempool design, only the outputs can be batched to reduce redundant functions with smart contracts or UTXOs.

Cardano uses batching from trusted third parties to do many computations, because it can't do them on chain in a decentralized MANNER like other chains can. Cardano needs zk rollups, or a trustless side chain (to a non-eutxo environment), or it will never have truly decentralized smart contracts like other chains have due to the limitations of EUTXO. It's really not the case that Cardano is a better design. It was designed in 2015, long before anyone knew how smart contacts would actually be used by dapps. Cardano has had to modify its road map significantly since then (dropping the computation layer). What we're seeing cardano apps do with batching was not part of the original plan. The Cardano chain was supposed to handle this for everyone, but they couldn't figure out how to implement it (similar to what happened to them with EILE)."	498ba63a13803c4b56ddff0ad5b0f30b19739d0a	True	False					0	1661541487		0	{}	ilwpfch	False	t3_wvoxmu	False	True	t1_ilv7lo8	/r/solana/comments/wvoxmu/solana_uses_2x_as_much_power_but_pushes_40x_as/ilwpfch/	1661541505	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]

&gt; The Master Edition account, derived from a Mint Account, is an important component of NFTs because its existence is proof of the Non-Fungibility of the token.

And because the mint authority is transferred right after the creation, so they know there will never be a new mint.

I thought that if we could define regular tokens with max supply = 1 and zero decimals it would be fine as those are _technically_ NFTs. But I guess all marketplaces will base their behaviour on the metaplex data structures and formats so I need to generate a master.

It looked like you were saying that could increase the effective tps. My comment was explaining why that is irrelevant to Cardano's scaling problem because it doesn't increase tps to batch them like that. 

&gt;Also doesn't the accounting model have the same issues or does it have some solutions for them that are impossible on utxo even with different approaches to design

Real DEXs are on chain, and their prices are verifiably set by on chain pools and market dynamics. Also other chains have decentralized oracles, but cardano doesn't. An open source DEX could create a trustless price because everyone could verify where it comes from. Right now, most people are going to set their slippage to a reasonable rate and accept whatever they get. So they could be skimming off the top of every trade, and prices will equilibrize, especially since there are so few apps and so little volume on Cardano. The point is that there is no way to know. 

&gt;if you eventually use open source and the proof of correct computation is settled on the chain, then where is the problem

I'm not saying it's inherently insecure. I'm saying it's completely absurd to claim that going off chain could ever be more secure. It creates an extra step for bugs to occur. It can't be more secure than the chains that do the same thing, but don't need to add the extra off chain code and trust model. It's crazy that they can convince people that Cardano eutxo smart contracts are more secure. There's no truth to that claim at all. The way things are done right now is obviously less secure than how other chains handle it, but even in theory, it will never be more secure to require off chain computations. 

&gt;computation layer is an optimization feature to remove blaot from the chain.

Specifically what optimization feature do you imagine is creating a decentralized off chain computation layer? Script references, data inputs, input indorsers, etc are not a computation layer. Smart contracts were never supposed to be on the consensus layer. Go watch the videos again. There's no squaring what Charles promised and what you got."	0b138794500ee4e128fa64ab24287a7dfa13e6bb	True	False					0	1661552005		0	{}	ilxf6f9	False	t3_wvoxmu	False	True	t1_ilx6dq5	/r/solana/comments/wvoxmu/solana_uses_2x_as_much_power_but_pushes_40x_as/ilxf6f9/	1661552023	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]

I meant it like it get broadcasted to the mempool, then the batcher puts multiple of them to chain in a batch.

&gt;so why not trust them for trusted transactions with closed source code where they can obviously censor you and possibly reorder your txs, give you false oracle information, and manipulate market prices.

yes, closed source is bad and community is demanding them to open it, minswap did open it brifly, then wingriders found bug, alerted them, they fixed it and closed it again, probably going to reopen it later. So far the txs have been going well, but yes, there is a some trust needed there at the moment. If they censor you, you can go spend your utxo somewhere else, and thanks to utxo it cannot then be double spent again. reordering is as much of a problem except frontrunning, but then that's why you can set your slippage tolerance, so the tx can only get cancelled with no fee if the price slips too far away from what you want. If they lie to you about the price you can also check somewhere else.

&gt;or computation layer is a massive security and decentralization vulnerability.

if you eventually use open source and the proof of correct computation is settled on the chain, then where is the problem?

&gt;That's because you're new, and you don't know anything about Cardano. Go watch any of Charle's old videos.

I'm not new, I've been into Cardano since 2018, and watched most of his videos.

&gt;Cardano doesn't have any other layers.

yet

&gt;Which is it? It is already happening on other layers, or it isn't happening yet, but it will?

you answered yourself, it's on the roadmap for the Basho era, which is being currently implemented, it might take a few years. 

&gt;Nothing proposed in the basho era will create a computational layer.

Basho is for optimization, and computation layer is an optimization feature to remove blaot from the chain. If any of the five eras makes sense for it, it's basho.

&gt;He talked about the computational layer nonstop until they abandoned it.

He is still talking about it, I've heard in some of the more recent videos as well.

&gt;It was mentioned in every road map Charles released for years. 

It doesn't fit any of the five stages, and I think it's not necessary, just a nice thing to have for more diverse developers to come in."	9a7bc2b45d816da202d72d430e0844b1d17c88a5	True	False					0	1661548324		0	{}	ilx6dq5	False	t3_wvoxmu	False	True	t1_ilx2d21	/r/solana/comments/wvoxmu/solana_uses_2x_as_much_power_but_pushes_40x_as/ilx6dq5/	1661548336	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]

You asked whether the first tx was on chain. It has to be. When it gets put on chain is irrelevant to the question.

&gt;most dexed use the same SPOs who are miniting the blocks to do the batching, you already have the decentralized trust for them

That's probably the sloppiest trust model in all of crypto. You're saying that you use them for trustless txs, so why not trust them for trusted transactions with closed source code where they can obviously censor you and possibly reorder your txs, give you false oracle information, and manipulate market prices. WHY EVEN USE A DEX LIKE THAT? What is the point? A CEX is easier, faster, cheaper, more reliable, and has a better and more established trust model. These capps are for people that don't know that they aren't defi, or otherwise do not know why defi exists. 

&gt; I think Cardano had the foresight to know utxo is better suited for smart contracts,

I promise you that statement is 100% false. UTXO is better for protocol security, not smart contacts. Eutxo is significantly less secure for smart contracts than any accounts model you want to compare. Off-chain batching without a roll up, side chain, or computation layer is a massive security and decentralization vulnerability. There's no rational argument that is it is better. All it does is add risk to what everyone else is doing. The only reason people think that is because Charles has marketed Cardano that way to people who have no understanding of how any of this works. 

&gt;I am not aware of any changes in the roadmap

That's because you're new, and you don't know anything about Cardano. Go watch any of Charle's old videos.

&gt;while the computation itself is done in another layers off the chain.

Cardano doesn't have any other layers. 

&gt;If it's not separated now, they are still preparing to separate it.

Which is it? It is already happening on other layers, or it isn't happening yet, but it will? Look, I'm not trying to be mean, but you are defending something that you don't know anything about. Nothing proposed in the basho era will create a computational layer. Now you're just making things up. Charles lied to you. You cannot trust what a salesman for a crypto project says. Go watch Charle's old videos. He talked about the computational layer nonstop until they abandoned it. 

&gt;also i don't think IELE was explicitly on the roadmap

It was mentioned in every road map Charles released for years.
