Russians also were programmed to continue thinking NATO is an adverssary, although that stopped with the collapse of the communist empire of SSSR, and even then NATO was a defense pact against agressive communist expansionism. Russia under Jeltsin was even invited to join the pact but a first only signed an associacion agreement which after Putin seems to be dead.

Those cultural delusions are strong in russian mentality. The people need to drop those patterns of thinking or they’ll just install another authocrat (they have strong respect for authocrats, crave them and despise democracy - to put it mildly: they have different view of what democracy is). 

Western media reports of peace demonstrations give the wrong picture and are probably a propaganda means for any russian that may be waching and is on the fence of what to *feel* about all of this to sway him over to dissent.

Weakened internally as he wages war against Ukraine, Putin will be forced to reconsider his plans. That's the theory, and that's what the Americans and Europeans are hoping for.

But that honestly may be as good as it gets right now. Until mortgage lenders, public utilities, taxing authorities, and mass retail begins accepting Bitcoin, its going to be spotty at best.

I know THIS will sound silly to some... but I'd also write a letter to the Board of Directors and/or various execs at every single one of the aforementioned places you do business with and TELL them you wish to pay in Bitcoin. They need to know that customers/constituents really want this. The more folks that make direct contact and push the issue... the more likely they are to start listening. Otherwise, they only have anecdotal evidence that some people want this and it stays off their radar even longer. We all know you may not move the needle on your own, but you'd be surprised at the same time.
