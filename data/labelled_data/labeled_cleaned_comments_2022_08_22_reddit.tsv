It's not the default face of CB and I kind of resent having to do the couple extra clicks to get there.  Looking again for other CEX options but being in the US is a hindering factor.  [FTX.US](https://FTX.US) is missing a couple of important tokens for me, Kraken doesn't have an ACH fiat onramp and I don't trust [Binance.US](https://Binance.US).  That leaves Gemini, [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) and KuCoin.  The latter two have really bad network fees for transfers.  So I guess I'm going to try out Gemini and see how it goes.

To me, it means the private key was never generated on nor typed into a general purpose computed, _any_ general purpose computer but especially computers that are or were or ever will be again connected to a network, esp. the internet.

So I wouldn't consider using Bitcoin core as ""cold storage"" unless used with a hardware wallet. Also, what you described seems like a hassle versus the easier and more secure best practice of using a hardware wallet.

By the way, the reason my definition of ""cold storage"" is so strict is because I know general purpose computers, even ""air-gapped"" computers, can be infected with rootkits.

Just imagine if you mined 50K bitcoins back in 2010, which was basically as easy as just let your PC mine in the background. Suddenly bitcoin is worth $1 and you've made $50K out of nothing almost. It would be very tempting to sell because you didn't know if it would continue to grow or go back to $0. All the FUD there is today it's nothing compared to how it was back in the day. 

Heck I remember back in like 2012-2013, I bought like 10.20 bitcoins at around $13 and sold 10 at around $200 thinking I just hit the jackpot. I just left the 0.20 bitcoins there and eventually forgot about them. I only remembered about them when bitcoin hit like $40K but was not able to recover them. The irony was that at that point the 0.20 btc ""change"" was worth much more than the profit I got from selling the 10 btc...truth is, shit happens, no point beating yourself over it, but at least learn a lesson.

Your node verifies all transactions/block it receives automatically. You don't need to manually look up transactions (although you can, if you want to).  

To gain the actual benefits of having your own node, you need to connect your actual wallet to it. The wallet then uses your node to look up and verify your incoming transactions and broadcast your outgoing transactions through your node.  

How to do that specifically depends on your wallet (mobile? hardware?) and your node setup (laptop? specialized hardware like raspberry pi?). There are a variety of ways and guides.  

Easiest way I know is to install Bitcoin Core on your machine and point your hardware wallet software to it. I think Ledger Live allows for that. Another way is to use another wallet software instead of Ledger Live (Specter, f.ex), which also can connect your hardware wallet to your local node."	b04958767b9e89e6644c31727cdf919a48f7ed01	True	False					0	1661049739		0	{}	il59ups	False	t3_wt8cx2	False	True	t1_il593uv	/r/Bitcoin/comments/wt8cx2/while_all_the_fud_is_going_on_i_have_decided_to/il59ups/	1661049751	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]			 gt so after you install and run the node where do you validate the transactions within the software if so what s the best way to find your transaction your node verifies all transactions block it receives automatically you don t need to manually look up transactions although you can if you want to to gain the actual benefits of having your own node you need to connect your actual wallet to it the wallet then uses your node to look up and verify your incoming transactions and broadcast your outgoing transactions through your node how to do that specifically depends on your wallet mobile hardware and your node setup laptop specialized hardware like raspberry pi there are a variety of ways and guides easiest way i know is to install bitcoin core on your machine and point your hardware wallet software to it i think ledger live allows for that another way is to use another wallet software instead of ledger live specter f ex which also can connect your hardware wallet to your local node 	0.002362579805776477	0.9894928932189941	0.002207921352237463	0.9315359592437744	0.007689852733165026	0.2340199202299118	0.09315743297338486	8.651389862279757e-07	0.34178870916366577	0.006478124763816595

They will send the BTC directly to your hardware wallet.  But they have minimum trade limit of $100K.  So... how big?

If that's too large, Kraken Pro has very low fees and good liquidity.  I tried Coinbase Pro and it's safe to say we hate each other.  They still won't release my crypto for at least another month.  Binance doesn't serve Texas, so nothing there for me but it may work for you.   Bitstamp is cute and has a nice interface but relatively high fees for large trades.
