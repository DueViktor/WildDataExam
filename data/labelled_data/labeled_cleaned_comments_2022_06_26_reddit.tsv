The word ""deflation"" doesn't get mentioned until 4:17, but the part right before that is important. If his style bothers you, you can always pause the video and read the transcript. In short, deflationary spirals lead to decreasing employment, which leads to decreased aggregate purchasing power, which leads to collapse in market economies. This doesn't have to happen every time there's any deflation, but it definitely can, and typically does if there's a significant amount and there isn't government intervention.

My problem with borrowing huge amounts of money is the interest owed on the loan over time can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars, then there is the duration which is usually 15 or 30 years. Doing back of the napkin math, I've found that even just putting my down payment in the stock market instead returned a much higher ROI, but maybe I didn't do the math right. I also found ROI charts comparing stocks and real estate that prove this too so it sort of makes no sense to me why people do it. If crypto continues high yields for decades, the results of putting your real estate down payment in a mix of crypto and stock assets is absolutely no contest.	43896f39f7bea870ba90d6ec32cc3a7c86281662	True	False					0	1656142750		0	{}	idnwz63	False	t3_vjy2q0	False	True	t1_idmim5t	/r/Bitcoin/comments/vjy2q0/creating_a_situation_to_find_out_how_much_this/idnwz63/	1656142761	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]

It’s not a stretch to say people with less means (excess funds) to invest *on average* likely possess less investment expertise but of course it’s wrong to make sweeping generalizations.

I saw one of these ATMs in the wild (was in a poorer area in the middle of nowhere central California FWIW.) For a 90k sats withdrawal the fee was ~18k sats. You can draw your own conclusions from that. It reminded me of predatory paycheck lenders whose profits rely on the unbanked spending inordinate %s in fees because they lack the option to avoid them. And I haven’t seen many of these ATMs in more affluent areas of LA. IME, people in more affluent areas use cash considerably less (like not at all for most people I know.) 

I think the main point was these are a ripoff. You’re better off getting a cash.app card or something, sending some sats to that wallet, converting it to fiat and withdrawing at a cashier at Family dollar or something."	699b404538180c2ac43e23fee71c8dd128e090f7	True	False					0	1656142726		0	{}	idnwy4y	False	t3_vjmwgs	False	True	t1_idldeol	/r/Bitcoin/comments/vjmwgs/united_states_largest_hispanic_supermarket_chain/idnwy4y/	1656142741	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]

But the reasons I hold is we already have institutional investment and adoption. In simplest terms, people/institutions already invested in Bitcoin won't let Bitcoin fail. The recent institutional selloffs were in my view shorts, meaning good, meaning they bought back in at the bottom and will never allow us to see the bottom again. Cities are mining BTC. The US federal government holds a shit ton of BTC.  


Additionally, after the next halving in 2024 bitcoin will be the rarest traded commodity on earth. There is value is rarity, literally no matter what it is.   


Finally, BTC is finally moving toward being used as actual money with all of the debit cards that use BTC transactionally. BTC may never really be used as money unless we decouple the idea it's value is derived from it's relationship to fiat money and start to charge set prices in Sats for goods, but the adoption is none the less exciting. If you can get your paycheck in BTC and spend it like money, those are great signs consumer investment outside of the speculative is on the horizon.   


There is no guarantee BTC will ever reach it's all time highs again, but it's already beyond the point you need to worry about it going to zero and staying there imo. If it drops below 17k again, buy. It may take until 2030, but the odds you lose on the investment are extremely low in my view."	57ecc7d6285898215e0a3133d806a652d229728e	True	False					0	1656137570		0	{}	idnqfmr	False	t3_vjp8ua	False	True	t3_vjp8ua	/r/Bitcoin/comments/vjp8ua/why_are_people_so_confident_in_bitcoin/idnqfmr/	1656137584	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]

This is very easy to see as false since the data is publicly available.

&gt;Even with as cheap as it is, no one wants to use it. AWS, GCP, Azure etc are growing at breakneck speeds.

Baseless claim. 

&gt;If Golem was a viable alternative with meaningful benefits over centralized services, the customers would be there.

&gt;Everything you say only exists in some decentralized utopia where no one wants to make any money. In reality though there is ZERO incentive to put any meaningful resources on Golem because Golem has not proven to be of any use to companies who actually need these resources.

This is circular logic again: ""It's useless, so no one uses it, so there's nothing to see and no one should use it.""

What I notice is you completely dodged all my arguments to assert unbacked claimed and circular logic fallacies. Decentralization isn't any utopia. Utopia is believing corporations that have no interest in providing best prices will somehow do so, as if virtue was constantly expected from them. 

&gt;You say AWS not being on Golem means they can't compete. Um, no, it's the opposite. It means Golem isn't competition and thus AWS has no need to be on Golem.

I have explained how. You dodged it to just claim this without any argument.

&gt;The market doesn't lie. Golem has no demand. No one is stopping Golem from growing. No one is stopping Nvidia from adding resources to Golem. No one is stopping all these big crypto miners from moving resources to Golem.

I'll tell you one thing you seem to forget about markets: knowledge assymetry. If you were right and there was no knowledge assymetry, no one would have used Bitcoin or valued it more than a few cents simply because no one wanted to use it for years. Yet here we are. Not only has Bitcoin proven that decentralization always dynamically provides as much as demand asks for, contrary to what you claimed, but it has also shown that something that isn't yet valued as demanded value by the market can be demanded later. 

It's just as if you were not understanding what markets are at all. Do you know what you're talking about? I mean, knowledge assymetry is a pretty known property of markets. It's curious you're completely disregarding it to resort to circular logic fallacies."	2c908f19ba9e32724ae3153f8577c362d88641c3	True	False					0	1656163459		0	{}	idony7v	False	t3_vhscdb	False	True	t1_idol2o4	/r/ethereum/comments/vhscdb/i_feel_like_no_one_outside_of_our_industry/idony7v/	1656163472	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

You know pools are single entities where miners don't have free will to vote on the current state of the chain right?

You know mining and the whole decentralization thing is about voting on current state of the chain right?

Besides the centralization of pools, the elephant in the room is, 90% of ASICs were made by Bitmain. One single entity, can install a backdoor, with one flip of a switch, 90% of hash power are under their control.

Staking pools takes commission, anyone with 32 ETH will not be using pools. PoS you don't need to wait years to mine a block. Even 32 ETH minimum stakers can get reward fairly quickly. So instead of giant pools like PoW, medium pools alone with many small stakers is what we most likely gonna see. Much more decentralized than PoW.

The reason we currently have giant staking pools like Lido is because stakers can't withdraw now. Lido provides an option to withdraw staked ETH (kind of). As soon as the merge happens and withdraw enabled. Lido will have no reason to be as big as it currently is."	b9e759e6c19d9850d6a692cc3892ef93cc567b37	True	False					0	1656160066		0	{}	idoi721	False	t3_vk642d	False	True	t1_idnz9cg	/r/ethereum/comments/vk642d/vitalik_buterin_clarifies_ethereum_centralization/idoi721/	1656160083	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

I do realize the amount of work and funds that are spent. And I do know that it's much more than the results you get from it, because it's still a distributed network, however hard they work for it. It's necessarily sub-par to a decentralized network in terms of solution exploration and cost reductions. 

&gt;Sure, people don't care about the number of engineers, but it's not a coincidence that the companies with all those engineers offer more capable hardware and better services than people on Golem. As of right now Golem can't compete with any of those services, so clearly it doesn't work how you think.

You're again claiming they can't compete as if there was some centralized organization deciding what amount of service they'd deliver. It's not the case. It's a decentralized service. Its offer dynamically matches needs. 

It's literally just like miners dynamically matching demand for chain security. No one claims miners won't be able to provide more security whenever it's needed, because everyone knows there are way more than enough human beings world wide to provide the service nearly as soon as it's asked.

&gt;This assumes that all the AWS, Azures, a GCPs of the world are part of it. If they're not, then no, it doesn't work like that.

Nothing prevents AWS from being on Golem. If they don't, it only means that they can't compete because they can only thrive with customers paying way more.

&gt;Golem can't scale fast regardless of the demand because the providers can't afford to scale as fast. Why? Because John Doe and Joe's Render Farm can't afford to scale like the big companies. They also can't achieve the same cost efficiencies.

Go tell that to miners, then. Lol, we've got years and years of reality disproving your claims, but sure. We've got so much of it even politicians are talking worldwide about the phenomenon of miners and their costs.

&gt;And this illustrates a clear flaw in your thinking. Your hypothetical network requires Google and Amazon etc to join it.

Absolutely not. They can, but they're not needed at all. It's so outstanding seeing people have such strong claims when it's clear miners have disproven such claims for more than a decade."	2a9dad0d5a8ecafa60ab86c44b434a9df11b48ef	True	False					0	1656159413		0	{}	idoh6oh	False	t3_vhscdb	False	True	t1_idm84nf	/r/ethereum/comments/vhscdb/i_feel_like_no_one_outside_of_our_industry/idoh6oh/	1656159430	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

If your intent is honest discussion, it's best to have full conviction before reaching for adversarial language.

If you don't have conviction about something, it's better to phrase your opinion as a question and see whether it leads your discussion partner into a contradiction or leads you toward a more correct understanding.

&gt;MEV = detestable rent seeking, would you agree?

It doesn't really matter how I feel about it. I'm not here to make value judgments.

It does have unfavorable properties for transaction senders, though, and in practice it isn't as permissionless as it could be, so I encourage the work being done to minimize/democratize it.

&gt;I appreciate your info nonetheless
