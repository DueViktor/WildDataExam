1. Ask me to share the cost basis, which I can obviously lie about.

Our end-goal is to try to make crypto more accessible and ""safe"" for the everyday consumer, not having to worry when buying/owning on XYZ platforms (the end target is to cover pretty much all platforms globally).

My Ledger Nano X was fucking up and kept erroring out while trying to move coins so I looked for a way to sign transactions “offline”

**My questions:** 

On a scale from ""posting my seed phrase on Reddit"" to ""The most secure way one can store a seed phrase"" how secure is what I've done? And what are the risks associated with these steps I've taken trying to create this ""Not-Hot-Not-Cold-Room-Temperature?-AirGapped-or-whateverthefuck-Wallet"".

**Here's what I did:**

* Generated 24 word seed phrase from a hardware wallet (Ledger)

Using a new, unopened Google Pixel 4:

* Removed sim. (Phone never activated).
* Connected to home wifi (secured with password).
* Updated to latest software (Android 12.0).
* Factory Reset. Set up pin to access phone.
* Connected to home wifi to download Blue Wallet from Play Store. Encrypted storage within app.
* Removed home wifi (Forget Network) and turned off all other external connections (bluetooth, mic, nfc) to my best knowledge.
* Deleted/Disabled everything on the phone except Blue Wallet (and the other apps I couldn’t delete/disable: Phone, Message, Calculator, Camera).
* Removed all permissions for all remaining apps (except Camera for Blue Wallet - to sign txs).
* Typed in seed phrase into Blue Wallet to use for signing my Watch Only wallet (on an iPhone) when/if necessary but Pixel 4 will never connect to anything wifi/bluetooth/nfc.
* Keeping Pixel 4 turned off at all other times.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm obviously hoping this doesn't suck from a security standpoint because I like the Blue Wallet interface and ""offline"" signing feature and still can't get my Ledger Nano X to work properly.

&amp;#x200B;

Assume anything not mentioned was not done. I welcome the experts, or those who simply know more than I do, to rip these steps apart."

A year ago I got set up with a Fold debit card and I installed the Lolli app to start earning sats back on fiat purchases.  This is the result, it's not life-changing or anything, but it beats airline miles.

I just used them for normal day-to-day purchases like lunch, gas, birthday/holiday gifts on Amazon &amp; elsewhere.  Now I'm sweeping them to cold storage &amp; we'll see what 1.2m sats is worth in 10yrs.

pro tip:  In some cases, you can double stack by using Fold &amp; Lolli (see Harry's razors)

BTC currently trades around $40k and with miner earnings coming 99% from inflation and 1% from transaction fees. Within 10 years, BTC will undergo 3 more halvings. So by 2032, at least one of the following must happen:

1. The price per bitcoin is $320K
2. The hash power and network security is way down.
3. Miners are mining at a loss (perhaps as a public service?)
4. People are paying 100x more fees to use bitcoin.
5. The 21 million hard cap is abandoned.

2-5 will stay regardless, but if we extend out a little farther the price must be $640K (2036), $1.28M (2040), $2.56M (2044), $5.12M (2048), 10.24M (2056) to pay for the same level of security.

While BTC price has more than doubled at each halving so far, I think items 2-5, or some combination thereof, are more likely in the medium term.

DeFi and other crypto initiatives, in general, use a consensus mechanism to safely offer their services and benefits to consumers. The three most popular consensus mechanisms are Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and the current favorite and my favorite as well - Proof of Reputation.   


This is what I've found online, a great explanation with great examples involving several DeFi platforms, but I will single out one part of the text as it talks about my favorite consensus mechanism PoR as I wrote earlier:   
""To illustrate the working of PoR, Kaiba DeFi’s applications can be observed. These applications manage to provide superior speed and significantly lower fees than counterparts thanks to their underlying Proof of Reputation system. As an example, take KaibaEx, the project’s Decentralized Exchange (DEX), which offers up to 20% less network fees than other exchanges, such as Uniswap, and facilitates fully commission-free trades, which is unmatched within the industry. Another great instance would be trading KAIBA, Kaiba Defi’s native crypto token, which, thanks to PoR and their contract optimization, can be 60% cheaper to transact with than other comparable ERC-20 tokens.""

For those unfamiliar, this is modeled after March Madness where the top 64 coins face off in a single elimination tournament. The winner moves on and the loser is out. The last coin left is declared the champion.

This is Ethereum’s third straight appearance in the tournament, all as a 1 seed. In 2020, it made it to the Elite 8, defeating Bytom, BAT, and ICON before falling to eventual champion Nano. Last year, it defeated Nexo before losing a tough second round matchup to Tezos. Tell your friends and maybe your frenemies; the more votes the better!

This is a real event, not spam and it’s just for fun. I know that different coins have different functions so it’s sometimes silly to ask “which is better,” but I’m still doing it because I think it’s fun. If this isn’t the type of post for this subReddit, I apologize and won’t post here again.

I am new to crypto and anything related. I wanted to get started and made a Binance account. I want to buy some Ether and withdraw it to a Metamask wallet on the ethereum mainnet. I saw Binance takes a 0.00625 Ether fee (about $16.50) to withdraw. I looked around for a bit and stumbled upon this site: [https://bridge.umbria.network/bridge/polygon-ethereum/eth](https://bridge.umbria.network/bridge/polygon-ethereum/eth) . According to this site I can bridge 0.1 Eth from polygon to Ethereum and recieve 0.0985 Eth. This makes it a 0.0015 Eth fee, or about $4. The Binance fee for withdrawing MATIC is 0.1, or about $0.14. So can't I just withdraw MATIC from Binance, swap it to Weth (pretty much without cost) and then bridge it to Ethereum? Am I missing something that would make this not work?

This is amazing news, all these so called ""Eth killers"" are really going to have to take notice.

For anyone who doesn't understand, without going into insane detail. Proof of work is a big part of why Ethereum gas fees are so high and why it is so limited as far as scaling itself is concerned. That's right you guessed it, Ethereum moving to proof-of-stake is going to be addressing a lot of Ethereum's limitations. 

This was the main thing that IMO I think these chains that are marketed as ""Eth killers"" had on our beloved Ethereum. No longer. If you were like me and you didn't think anything was going to kill Ethereum regardless before. You're definitely like me and you don't have a shadow of a doubt now that Ethereum is here to stay and absolutely no other chain is going to be ""killing"" it.

I love Ethereum and I love incredible chains and ecosystem's like Polygon that have come out of Ethereum. This being the obvious Ethereum subreddit I'm assuming we all love Ethereum. This is the most bullish news I've personally heard in a long time and I'm incredibly excited to see where we're going to be going.

Voting has begun and will run for 3 days. The coin with more votes will move on to the next round to play the winner of: **6. Litecoin** vs. **11. Axie Infinity**

For those unfamiliar, this is modeled after March Madness where the top 64 coins face off in a single elimination tournament. The winner moves on and the loser is out. The last coin left is declared the champion.

This is SOL’s second straight tournament appearance. Last year, after defeating Kusama, it fell to Cardano in the second round. Tell your friends and maybe your frenemies; the more votes the better!

This is a real event, not spam and it’s just for fun. I know that different coins have different functions so it’s sometimes silly to ask “which is better,” but I’m still doing it because I think it’s fun. If this isn’t the type of post for this subReddit, I apologize and won’t post here again.

You can have rewards from your own stake (i.e. you stake 1000 SOL to your own validator) and then you can also have rewards from others delegating to your validator (i.e. commission set at 10% so you keep 10% of all delegator rewards). 

From my understanding, delegator rewards (outside delegators staking to your validator -- those that are charged the X% commission) auto compound/re-stake based on protocol design. 

However, rewards from your own stake (i.e. the 1000 SOL that you yourself staked to your validator) do not auto compound. Rather they accumulate and live on the actual Solana validator node itself. But What if you want to compound those rewards......How would you withdraw the rewards from your own stake into let's say another wallet/account on Solflare (goal here would be to withdraw your staked validator rewards and re-stake in order to compound) ? I understand a withdrawer key would be needed, but would you need to go through the Solana CLI?

For those unfamiliar, this is modeled after March Madness where the top 64 coins face off in a single elimination tournament. The winner moves on and the loser is out. The last coin left is declared the champion.

This is SOL’s second straight tournament appearance. Last year, after defeating Kusama, it fell to Cardano in the second round. Tell your friends and maybe your frenemies; the more votes the better!

This is a real event, not spam and it’s just for fun. I know that different coins have different functions so it’s sometimes silly to ask “which is better,” but I’m still doing it because I think it’s fun. If this isn’t the type of post for this subReddit, I apologize and won’t post here again.

I want to collect payments and distribute each sale transaction to 3 wallets. The first wallet receives revenue from the cost of goods only. This is the merchant address included in the URL for the POS.

The other two wallets split an additional merchant fee that is a percentage of the Cost of Goods. I need to adjust the distribution of this merchant fee to these other two wallets using an adjustable percentage such as 50/50; 60/40; 18/82 etc...whatever I want.

Is this possible?

I expect the Totals screen to look something like (Total)=(cost\_of\_goods)+(tx\_fee)+(merchant\_fee). I think the merchant fee can be split off at the same time the tx fee is?

I expect the Totals screen to look something like (Total)=(cost\_of\_goods)+(tx\_fee)+(merchant\_fee). I think the merchant fee can be split off at the same time the tx fee is? 

I'm not a developer...just someone who had to learn a little about several languages a long time ago.

Simply put, launchpads like [Whale Maker](https://www.whalemaker.org/index.html) are the only platforms that cushion the user from the risk of losing their funds or investing/buying low-potential digital assets. The platform takes it upon itself to conduct vetting processes to ensure all projects allowed into it are credible, viable, and high-potential. This gives you the advantage of safety and a sense of security when you join such a platform to buy your assets through it.

Besides ensuring buyer and developer security and flawless transaction processing, the launchpad gives you access to the early private sales of the tokens in question. When the project goes public, these tokens rise in value, and anyone who bought them earlier through the launchpad stands to gain high profits.

On that note, one thing that some people overlook is the importance of making the right choice among the various launchpads available. A good launchpad will guarantee you the best results."

They've been around for 4+ years and have never been hacked or had any issues with payouts or withdrawals. They have the highest interest rates of any CeFi platform because they use DeFi strategies to generate yield. Plus they dont have any loyalty tokens you need to buy to get the highest reward rates. Best of all, interest is paid out daily and there are no lockups so you can withdraw anytime! The funds are managed automatically using Fireblocks which is used by all big exchanges so its very secure. They're just not well known yet because they haven't spent any money on advertising and have been focused on developing the platform.
