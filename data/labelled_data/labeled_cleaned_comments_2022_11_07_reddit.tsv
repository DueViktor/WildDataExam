4	[]	False		igadjeed						"&gt; how does the network really know if the timestamp is accurate?

It does not, and there are many blocks with a timestamp earlier than the parent block. The 2016-block target adjustment assumes near-enough accuracy based on two rules  

* Be less than 2 hours in the future from your computer’s current time  
* Be greater than the median timestamp of the past 11 blocks  

See: https://blog.lopp.net/bitcoin-timestamp-security/  

Note that these rules are consensus tests applied by each node. That is, the rules are not applied directly to the miner. A miner is not prevented from submitting a block which has a timestamp outside these rules. But the block will be rejected by each node which receives it  

Occasionally, a forum will see a ""why did my node stop updating, why is it rejecting block #nnnnnn with this error, block timestamp too far in the future?"" request for help. If an individual node's clock drifts more than 2 hours back, that node will reject valid blocks"	ee943c6c5d8b93beac6883ab1c55c61fe98eb865	True	False					0	1667720941		0	{}	iv9ax3e	False	t3_ymqp6t	False	True	t3_ymqp6t	/r/Bitcoin/comments/ymqp6t/how_do_timestamps_work_with_the_blockchain_and/iv9ax3e/	1667720952	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_vy03v	False	False

# Market Cycles SWOT Analysis
  
 
  
SWOT Pointers that tell us where we are. Looking for occurrences that capture the attention of the 3 categories of Bitcoin market participants: (t) short-term traders, (m) medium-term momentum buyers, (d) long-term dca hodlers:
  
 
  
## Strengths
  
 
  
(d)(m) - FED BASICALLY IGNORED. Most powerful voice in fiat financial world JPowell talks about continuing to raise interest rates and tighten, to a higher rate than previously revealed, and the Bitcoin price hardly dropped at all, floated up a bit in the following days.
  
 
  
(d)(m) - FIAT CRISES. With the increasing numbers of countries dealing with big inflation problems, their markets are getting pummeled by the FED, and the rocketing DXY continues to absolutely smash other fiat currencies and non-US treasuries, all say it's very likely we will see increased demand in BTC as an easily accessed safe haven asset.
  
 
  
(d)(m)(t) - SUPPLY CRUNCH. Lowering exchange supply, one-year lows according to coinglass
  
 
  
(d)(m) - REGULATION BRINGING INFLOWS. If deadlines and legislative timelines are followed, stablecoin and possibly Bitcoin regulation is coming in the US within the next few months
  
 
  
(d)(m)(t) - HODLER STRENGTH. Hodl waves showing hodlers are committed, 1+ year ATH
  
 
  
(m)(t) - OVERSOLD. The BTC market is oversold, on nearly all timeframes on several indicators
  
 
  
(d)(m)(t) - MINING COMPANIES SMASHED. huge commercial BTC miners that are in financial trouble have already liquidated their Bitcoins and the market slurped them up and didn't blink, Core Scientific and Argo
  
 
  
(d)(m)(t) - UN-IRONIC FARCICAL CRITICISMS. authors on subReddits are offering up such bizarre tripe, just when you thought the market downturn had dispersed all the loons
  
 
  
(d)(m)(t) - GREENING. As big money investors look to allocate capital to green mining operations, those miners that are damaging to the environment are getting bled dry and the miners that have access to renewables are flourishing
  
 
  
## Weaknesses
  
 
  
(d)(m)(t) - BITCOINERS NOT SELF-EDUCATING. A lot of us don't know about all of the progress being made around the globe regarding miners moving to renewables
  
 
  
(m)(t) FED HAUNTING. Awaiting a pivot, many medium-term and short-term investors are shying away for now.
  
 
  
(d)(m)(t) LACK OF REGULATION. Clarity and guidance on accounting, taxes, custodial setups, and much more are still in the air
  
 
  
## Opportunities
  
 
  
(d)(m)(t) US SEC, CFTC. Tax clarity, all satisfactory to Institutions and Family Offices (Massive inflows needed to push the price to new ATH)
  
 
  
(d)(m) U.S. spot ETF
  
 
  
(m) RENEWABLES. Major improvements through renewables in lowering energy costs for mining and lowering impact on the environment
  
 
  
(d)(m)(t) FED PIVOT. Not until more unemployment and more economic pain, or possibly a wave of government defaults and/or other Central Bank pivots that the FED can't address with swaps or repo's or other band-aids and duct tape
  
 
  
## Threats
  
 
  
(m)(t) Many miners sell off all at once
  
 
  
(m)(t) Many leveraged companies wiping-out all at once
  
 
  
(d)(t) Tether wipe-out
  
 
  
(m)(t) Green ESG FUD (this can only suppress prices as long as the lies against BTC mining can be sustained)
  
 
  
(d)(m)(t) BLACK SWANS. Nuclear strikes or irreparable double-spends in the BTC system
  
 
  
SUMMARY
  
ALL PROBABILITIES HERE, NO CERTAINTIES. Yeah, outside of black swans, I'm starting to think the Bitcoin market has found a bottom. I think the pieces are coming together and we are going to see a major relief rally soon, possibly beginning with a Santa Rally, or Q1 to Q2 of 2023. I don't think the rise will be an ATH, but some juicy gains. Anyone out there who got tricked by conbase or binuts and are still dragging around sh--coins, maybe the rally will give some opportunities to sell them off and buy more sats.

31	[]	False		igadjeed						"&gt; We all know that ""buying"" and ""selling"" Bitcoin with fiat is called money laundering today, unless done through the proper fiat franchised exchanges

Nonsense  

To be defined as money laundering, the trader has to be aware that one or more of his clients is giving him money which was acquired through crime  

In the Morpheus Titania case, a couple of traders attracted undercover FBI agents as clients. The FBI agent casually mentioned he was buying Bitcoin with drug money. Morpheus's partner walked away, refused any further business from these clients. Morpheus continued selling them Bitcoin. Only one of these traders was prosecuted for money laundering - Morpheus Titania  
https://www.justice.gov/usao-az/pr/bitcoin-trader-sentenced-41-months  

Note that there was no money laundering. The mere suggestion by an undercover agent is sufficient proof for the court, even though the agent was lying

&gt; Added ""selling"" Bitcoin, which is apparently the restricted act

That's naive, and false. A trader who buys Bitcoin which was received as ramsomware is also liable for a money laundering charge, if he knows the source of the Bitcoin is a crime (or if he suspects, or can be reasonably expected to suspect)  

But without knowledge or suspicion of money laundering, buying or selling Bitcoin is not money laundering  

In the USA, the Federal agency FinCEN requires money services businesses to register. Then after registration, a money services business is required to implement anti-money-laundering procedures. Failing to register is an offense, but is not money laundering. Failing to implement AML procedures is an offense, but is not money laundering  

Individual USA states have separate requirements for registering money laundering businesses  

An individual who sells or buys Bitcoin in person but not as a business, is not required to register as a money services business  

What makes the difference between trading among friends and being a money services business? Ask your lawyer. But no decent person would seek to profit from friends by charging above market prices"	f887e7e9205367a04f726cb22222a91378f77d5b	True	False					0	1667718610		0	{}	iv989av	False	t3_ymz4ku	False	True	t3_ymz4ku	/r/Bitcoin/comments/ymz4ku/does_someone_here_actually_know_the_law/iv989av/	1667718622	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_vy03v	False	False

There is the phrase Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins. As long as XRPs are on the exchange, they are not your XRPs. History has known cases where CEXs have been hacked. It's very sad when someone steals someone else's money, but unfortunately it's an inherent part of everything around us.  
In almost any situation, you can find a solution that is in the middle.  
Personally I am storing crypto in the following way:

* Сold storage — 30%,
* Personal wallet — 30%
* Exchange #1 — 20%
* Exchange #2 — 20%

This distribution of cryptocurrencies helps you avoid losing most of your assets, and also allows you to keep your money partially mobile… 40% can be sold on CEX if your asset suddenly goes up in value. Crypto in your personal wallet also maintains mobility as you can exchange it using DEX and swap services (Example SwapSwop).

No and that's the entire point of Ripple's ODL software that uses XRP, which was also built in 2017 to avoid any regulatory issues from banks holding XRP/crypto. But as volume and liquidity of XRP increases and XRP becomes more and more preferred as a settlement asset then banks and companies have an incentive to hold XRP.  


&gt;Market makers will become the biggest holders of XRP and will hold on behalf of most banks, so that they don't have to hold directly in their books and take any risks.  
  
By Ripple (2015) : Market makers themselves may be subsidiary of banks and sometimes they are managed like investment funds. Private investors will place money with these MMs (e.g. Japan-Asia MM Fund, India-Singapore MM Fund, Asia-Europe MM fund) for earnings. Therefore, the risk of holdings are placed onto investors in exchange for profit made from network utility through market-making. Profit in market making is greater with higher network utility, and will likely be very profitable given the volume of global remittance. Addressing volatility: The percentage volatility is high today simply because the number of participants (holdings of XRP) is comparably low. This can, and will likely be addressed through higher participation and thus higher price.  
By David Schwartz (2018): We're currently working on scaling xRapid, which relies on market makers holding XRP and providing liquidity.  
It's not exactly stability that banks who hold XRP would want, it's more a low holding cost. Volatility generally does increase holding cost, but a general, long-term upward movement reduces it. That's what Ripple wants, of course.  
If the price of XRP is volatile, that means that people who hold XRP will sometimes have gains and sometimes have losses. If the price is volatile but constant over the long term, then the gains will more or less cancel out the losses. There is, however, a big exception -- if you hold more XRP when the price is dropping and less when it's going up, you can take losses even if the price is constant over the long term.  
For XRP to be competitive as a settlement asset, it has to be better than whatever the next choice would be. A high holding cost will make XRP competitive in only the most expensive or inefficient corridors.  
\-----------  
Because the long-term trend of XRP is up, market makers will make much more money on the price than they will lose. Moreover, market makers will not be able to charge insane fees like they do today. This is because the barrier to entry for market makers under Ripple is significantly lower than it is for market makers under the SWIFT system, thus eliminating fees (or at the very least, drastically reducing them) as it will nearly impossible to establish a monopoly.  
As utility increases, there will be more liquidity in the market - more buyers and sellers. This will attract market makers who want to make margins on trades. Market makers need to buy and hold on to large stacks of XRP and fiat (all different currencies) in order to smoothly fund their operations. These are some of the people who will be buying and holding XRP and pushing the price up.
