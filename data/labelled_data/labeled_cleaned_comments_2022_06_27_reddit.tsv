55 would be enough for 32 on mainnet validator and 16eth+1.6RPL rocketpool validator. and even then that would still leave some for liquid staking.

If it suits you to think it's the case, I don't see why I should say anything. It's not as if it mattered anyway. I hope it helps you cope with reality. It must be hard to have to deal with such amounts of delusion all the time. 

&gt;I have already said (and proven in other post, if you talk about the negatives of POS or EIP-1559 it gets censored. We literally can’t discuss it.

And I already answered that I can still see your comments answering to mine. But you dodged the answer, like anything else. You were not showing anything but a single argument that was very easy to debunk and you then very quickly claimed that I was a dev and that, therefore, nothing I said could be true. Classic fallacy of ""you are this or that, so your argument is necessarily false"". No one prevented you to show that list at the time, no one but yourself.

Still irrelevant to the tech. We were talking about PoS and the fact it only changes how consensus power is distributed between consensus actors. It has nothing to do with scams happening on the chain (which happen right now, aka in PoW, by the way).

So? How is it contradictory? Lido isn't a threat to the network. All it can do is temporarily affect its stability, once, at the cost of all its stake. And L0 is how it's solved.

Rather than claiming it makes no sense, you could... you know... ask for details when you don't understand something. It would probably help you have some relevant remarks rather than being so irrelevant all the time.

&gt;Even in this post you didn’t answer many questions…

Probably because there weren't many questions to begin with. I'm still waiting for it.

&gt;Long story short. You are staking balls deep in a ponzi, scam, or at min a Plutocracy.

Still a baseless claim, not an argument.

The point is letting you write and write and write more, publicly, so that everyone can see for themselves who you really are and how you behave, so that they can make their own opinions about you. I'm quoting you specifically, so that you can't hide yourself by deleting your posts. 

I'm ensuring people who want to have the opportunity to discredit themselves can do so, such that others can know the answers to their trolling when there's no affect about it (it can be a disadvantage on many occasions, but not for that, fortunately) and can know how far they can go in ugliness.

No, you forgot your several baseless claims. Besides:

This was a strawman: I never claimed such a thing.

&gt;You don’t care and are blinded by greed. Nothing on planet earth will convince you of one single negative of POS. You simply have too much money invested to argue logically.

Still a baseless claim. Not an argument. 

Besides, I've explained why your supposed arguments were fallacies or I asked for you to provide arguments about your unsupported claims. 

And that's quite rich of you to claim I'm not arguing logically when you're the one who doesn't provide any argument, just claims and fallacies. And then I'm supposed to be the troll? Figures. 

The only arguments you've actually provided were going literally the opposite way, with quotes of Vitalik expliticely explaining Lido's situation isn't the drama people are claiming it is.

Wait. Our? Are you more than one person? Who are you talking about? And half of arguments? Which ones? I didn't see any argument I didn't answer to.

\-Kraken CEO

I originally got into crypto bc I was disgusted by the intersection of money and politics.  I would very much rather the CEO of my crypto to STFU about ANYTHING NOT CRYPTO (as he literally said he was going to do with his company culture LIE) So after seeing someone at the top of a lot of money in order to DYOR we are forced to contemplate what it means.  

So let look at this tweet, it's trying to be pseudo-intellectual in this libertarian wannabe 10th-grade 'gottcha on a technicality' bulllshit that makes my brain want to throw up.  

Wow we only have a 2 sided choice that **you** are giving us? Either we think they got the fact's wrong or OBVIOUSLY, we are angry bc we don't understand what their job is???

Idk about you but I can't fcuking stand when people talk down to ANYONE, much less saying that if we don't agree with SCOTUS it's bc we don't understand what their job is.  NAHHH FCUK YOU - Take your gas-lighting bullshit elsewhere.

This case has nothing to do with the facts, nothing to do with saving babies, and everything to do about the concentration of power and control.  

Something a crypto CEO of crypto should probably be aggressive against (this is why I call ur tweet libertarian wannabe) Then he talks about the roll of specialists in this conversation, all of a sudden just gas-lighting everyone. As everyone is technically wrong but he is right!  BC He is a constitutional specialist?!?

In the eight years since, there's also been plenty of opportunity for anyone else to buy in at low prices. October 2015 got down into the crowdsale price range, under half a buck per ETH. Much of 2016 was under $10 per ETH.

But what if you got into crypto later? Bottom of the 2018 bear market, an ETH cost $82. It stayed around $100 for a good while. In spring of 2020, the ETH price got down to $110, so you could buy a full validator for about $3500.

Basically, if you were paying attention in the early days and weren't homeless, or finally caught on by 2020 and had some reasonable savings, you could easily buy a validator....as long as you hadn't been brainwashed by bitcoin maximalists complaining about the ""70% premine."""	1ec563576df88c2b7633edb8dc94ae953a600925	True	False					0	1656257685		0	{}	idte0w1	False	t3_vl5zya	False	True	t3_vl5zya	/r/ethereum/comments/vl5zya/how_will_eth_function_after_pos/idte0w1/	1656257704	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		True

Your amount of eth id def consider a node or pool. Personally I’d lock some up on a cold wallet hodl then decide pool , node or if you wanted to use a kyc exchange and stake.

This was the USD value of RPL on the day it was available to claim. As you can see it bounces around a bit and is trending down as more stakers come on (and as prices drop in general) but this is also liquid and goes right back to your wallet once you claim it, not being locked in the staking contract until the merge. 

I am using allnodes to run nodes though, so I’ve been paying I think $60/mo for 3 nodes in that time. But they were super easy to get setup on also and I don’t have to worry about it other than making sure I have enough prepaid balance.

In this take-over case, I'm hoping that the honest validators (less than 1/3rd of the network) would fork the state prior to corruption, and continue validating. Since blockchain state transitions are deterministic, it would be easy to prove which is the fake chain versus the real chain.

At that point, everyone would refuse to recognize the corrupted chain as legitimate; i.e., any USDC would be unredeemable, any tokenize real-world assets would be irredeemable, any NFT projects would be seen as illegitimate, etc.

However the people who get really fucked would be any bridged assets.

401	[]	False		php_questions			[]				text	t2_q5rne	False	False	"Your trezor stores the private key (derived from your seed phrase) on the device itself. Your PC could be riddled with malware and keyloggers, yet you could still safely use your trezor connected to your PC.

When you want to make a transaction with the ledger, you need to send it a message like this:  


""Send 1 btc to address X""

&amp;#x200B;

Your trezor then displays the message for you to confirm, once confirmed it will sign the message with your private key.

&amp;#x200B;

Important to note: This message can NOT be altered in any way. You can't just take the signed message and change the address from ""address X"" to ""address y"" or the amount from ""1 btc"" to ""2 btc"" for example. If you change the message, the signature won't be valid anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

There is literally no way to ""hack"" this mechanism, its completely secure.

You can have 100 trojans and keyloggers on your PC, the only thing that can happen is that some malware sends a different message to your trezor:  


For example: You want to send the message: ""send 1 btc to address X""

but your malware wallet sends the message ""send 2 btc to address y""

&amp;#x200B;

But remember: The trezor literally shows you the amount and address before signing the transaction, so if you intend to send 1 btc to address X, but the trezor shows you 2 btc to address y, then you simply decline the transaction on your trezor. 

&amp;#x200B;

Done. Unhackable."	c65849cb4d98d1cb52388caf7d364e2c30d02a53	True	False					0	1656209328		0	{}	idrbu07	False	t3_vk6p3o	False	True	t1_idr86gf	/r/solana/comments/vk6p3o/phantom_wallet_drained/idrbu07/	1656209341	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]
