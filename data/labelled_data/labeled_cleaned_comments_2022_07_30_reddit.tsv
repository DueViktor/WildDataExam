Only one? Too easy. 

Having a credit card and paying anything with it. 

You can also have cold storage services, generic computation services, court arbitration services, video transcoding to streaming format, crowdfunding services, bounty services, betting platform services, gamble platform services, authorship proof services, lending services. There are more, but I don't have them in mind right now.

&gt;Again, you can't go buy a chocolate bar with crypto, nor would you due to the currency's volatility.

This is blatantly false for an entire country, so maybe you could stop deluding yourself so much, you're only shaming yourself in public, here. And volatility has nothing to do with ability and willingness to pay with it, as is proven by all the people who already use it.

53	[]	False		Perleflamme			[]				text	t2_13pqgo	False	False	"&gt;decentralisation is distribution of information (in this case, blockchain data) between several computers. even two computers connected to each other fall under this definition.

More than that, you need a concept of networks where you go beyond the distribution class, into the decentralization class, in that: 

* no node is prevented to access any other node (otherwise, it means specific nodes control the flow and it becomes a distributed network rather than a decentralized one);
* no one is prevented from becoming a new node, given enough resources (this is trustlessness). 

The practical side only is that you'd ideally need a resource constraint (the ""given enough resources"") low enough to guarantee enough people can participate so that any dramatically disruptive event happening to the network doesn't disrupt the network itself, be it local communication interruptions or collusion attempts. 

The resource constraint is the reason why a Raspberry Pi is the target hardware requirement of nodes. Ideally, even having a standard computer as the target hardware requirement would be more than enough. Going to the target hardware requirement of a gaming computer could still be workable, but not ideal. 

But more importantly, it means decentralization aims at ensuring there is no single point of failure and that there is no risk of collusion (which leads to censorship-resistance and history provability). And up until now, I see nothing you've pointed at which is a single point of failure or a risk of collusion. I've neither seen anything you've pointed at which restricts anyone from becoming a node either or from participating to the consensus. 

All I see is you claiming that all or most nodes and validators are owned by companies / government or anything unrelated to users. 

Yet, up until now, I'm yet to see all bakers in the world colluding to poison their customers (that's what you're required to imply to make any sense): not going to happen. Just as much, I'm yet to see miners successfully collude when there are enough miners. And just the same, even if all nodes and validators are from companies, there is no way they can collude, as is shown both by game theory and by miners not having successfully colluded anyway. 

As such, even the assumed fact that all nodes and validators are owned by companies / government isn't enough to break decentralization. 

This is very different from Solana, for instance, which requires extremely high hardware constraints (more than a gaming computer, with also lots and lots of staked SOL to be any profitable) and a specific class of permissioned validators (aka it directly breaks trustlessness). 

&gt;pseudo-decentralisation (that is, commercial) which is used by ethereum, solana etc isn’t really secure as it doesn’t fulfill the conditions of practical decentralisation

This is blatantly false. I know several people who have nodes and who aren't a company at all. But even then, it's not the matter anyway, given what we've just seen. 

You're just handwaving by having claimed as obvious without proofs that all nodes and validators are owned by either company or government rather than users, without showing that it's even a sufficient condition."	f970e9829a36f901a1ecaee22f41d21788f3b590	True	False					0	1659069550		0	{}	ii35yu3	False	t3_wa7a43	False	True	t1_ii31szd	/r/ethereum/comments/wa7a43/why_is_etc_still_alive_and_making_some_occasional/ii35yu3/	1659069562	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]
