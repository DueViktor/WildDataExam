EIP1559 changed gas fees to be comprised of two different portions:
- The base fee, which is dynamically decided upon by the network based on how full each block is. The network always tries to target 50% usage of the total gas in a block, and will adjust the base fee for the next block up or down to meet that 50% target. If above 50%, fee rises by 12.5%. If below 50%, fee drops by 12.5%.
- The priority fee, which is decided by the user, and acts the exact same as the old fee system, except it's typically much, much lower, only being a few gwei. Users always need to pay the full base fee, but may pay extra for the priority fee to incentivise miners to include their transaction first.

The base fee makes up 95+% of the total gas fee and is the part that's burned, hence it being subtracted from rewards, while the remaining &lt;5% is what gets paid to miners (soon to be validators). Because of the burn, it's possible that more ETH is burned than is minted as part of the block reward, which causes that block to become deflationary."				1645414054	{}	hxsemgj	False	t3_sx4dch	False	False	t1_hxrpdj1	/r/ethereum/comments/sx4dch/ethereums_hashrate_reaches_new_alltime_high/hxsemgj/	1651174053.0	5	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m		0	[]

72	[]		Fheredin			[]				text	t2_y4p3e	False	False	[]	"I think the key to understanding what has gone wrong with the centralized internet is to understand that centralized websites are fundamentally dictatorships. Members have no say over who their hosts or admins are, who in turn dictate who their moderators. Fundamentally, it's not your community; you just happen to go there. And for the record, this is not centralized internet's fault; it inherited this from Web1, but as the scale increased, the problems with totalitarian governance worsened.

I don't think we'll see a true web3 decentralized community until we have a tokenomic system to govern such an entity like a constitutional democratic republic. You have to have a way to distinguish longstanding members of a community from visitors, and allow longstanding members to govern themselves. 

Once you have that, I am reasonably confident that the centralization problem will also subside; a member who loves the community will likely offer to host or mirror a community with a very narrow profit margin, much more narrow than a non-member. And most communities would likely prefer a member to host their community because they know the host and have direct access.

What can Ethereum do to create this? Tokenomics and governance. You can create a tokenomic system to determine who is and isn't a member, to govern the community, and to reward members who are hosting. If you want a trustless arrangement, you can also use the blockchain to host NFT hashes to verify what the host is displaying, like the Lens protocol uses."				1645411362	{}	hxs92z9	False	t3_sxazcq	False	True	t3_sxazcq	/r/ethereum/comments/sxazcq/centralization_broke_the_internet_its_time_to_fix/hxs92z9/	1651154511.0	2	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m		0	[]

Obviously this would be a LOT more complicated and challenging than a ""simple"" provider for p2p-based insurance. Therefore it would probably make sense to prioritize the latter to test the waters. 
On that note: there already exists a kind of insurance provider on the Ethereum blockchain : https://etherisc.com/. Right now they offer flight and crop insurance. I imagine both use cases have relatively easy-to-verify payout conditions.

Non native Solana coins are wrapped by a number of different dapps and dex's to create the SOL that they want to use on their respective dapp or dex.  If you go to a dex like Jupiter / saber/ raydim and you type in SOL to swap, you will see wrapped sol, mSOL, aSOL, pSOL etc. If your head hasn't exploded yet, then good. Maybe the easiest way to figure this out is to go back to your original question. How did you receive the original SOL?

259	[]		outdoordude250			[]				text	t2_238ap1vl	False	False	[]	"It's my opinion that Solana has had the advantage of quick infrastructure development speed over Algorand, and that its very strongly correlated to having a strong, well-funded, coordinated push by VCs for better or worse, mainly Sam-Bankman Fried. It has been able to to gain so much traction because it has been able to 'bypass' a lot of the fee/scalability issues inherent to EVM chain architecture and was really the first one funded well enough to do so.

It is also my opinion the the Algorand protocol itself is better and more secure than Solana. I also have a hunch that it is already more scalable as of today but that's another argument. Like Solana, development on Algorand has to be built from scratch h because it doesnt employ EVM. While still fairly well funded, it hasnt had the coordinated effort of an entire large exchange pushing its development. There are a ton of things on the horizon though.

Solana and Algorand both have had extremely aggresive token vesting schedules that are common with POS protocols. I feel like we are seeing that EVM compatible protocols that are faster and cheaper than Ethereum have a relatively easier time overcoming this as developers are already familiar with Solidity dont have to do much extra work to deploy on those chains. Solana was able to overcome because they were able to get products to the mainnet much faster than a lot of others due to their well organized, well funded backing. Unfortunately the Algorand price was not able to overcome the aggressive vesting because it didnt quite have the infrastructure and to have enough value in the ecosystem at those times. The situation has gotten a lot better in the last 2 months. Take this with a grain of salt, but I think the tide is about to change."				1645460133	{}	hxugsgo	False	t3_swfaf3	False	True	t3_swfaf3	/r/solana/comments/swfaf3/why_is_sol_better_than_other_new_age_blockchain/hxugsgo/	1651428031.0	1	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n		0	[]

I took a look at etherisc and it does seem like a platform for insurance applications to be constructed. Also explored one of the books and it seems that they are trying to solve a broader more generic issue instead of tailoring their solution to a single problem. So for me, I am Web developer mostly focused on the front-end. I can do full stack but I am mostly allocated to the FE. Been doing it for some years. Lately have been exploring cryptocurrency and Blockchain and found Solana to be interesting. Have been doing a bit of Rust as well. I actually already started taking a look at this and am making some advances when I have time. Just exploring for now, as I haven't invested enough in research. It started as a way to just learn Solana and block chain, but who knows it could turn out to be something. If you are interested I could share more about it in private, would that be ok for you, would really enjoy a good critic and if you find it interesting you can join, what do you say?				1645479500	{}	hxvtjo6	True	t3_swgoxk	False	True	t1_hxv3dot	/r/solana/comments/swgoxk/distributed_insurance_feasibility/hxvtjo6/	1651596338.0	1	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n		0	[]
