First and foremost, I love using lightning to move bitcoin. I remember back in the day in 2018 people were talking about only 1/3rd of bitcoin lightning transactions above 100 USD were able to succeed. Now everyone can use that amount every single day without issue.              

So I'm glad to see we can use bitcoin to buy groceries, pay for gas at the pump, etc. But my question now is, ""What will it take to make lightning integration *the new and must-have standard*?"" Is this something that will take another halving cycle to complete?"

## Coinbase is now under increased scrutiny from regulators, as the business is the subject of multiple lawsuits. 

The San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange, which is already under investigation by the **US Securities and Exchange Commission** (SEC), is now facing two fresh legal claims from two different law firms.  


On Thursday, Bragar Eagel and Squire, a New York-based law firm, announced that it will sue Coinbase for making false representations about its business operations. Pomerantz LLP has also filed a lawsuit against the exchange, claiming compensation for any losses incurred as a consequence of the defendant's breaches of federal securities laws. This lawsuit was filed to recompense the plaintiffs.

In both complaints, plaintiffs claim that Coinbase made misleading and deceptive assertions about its business, operations, and compliance activities between April 14, 2021, and July 26, 2022. According to the lawsuits, Coinbase failed to disclose that client cryptocurrency was held in escrow at Coinbase, making it part of a bankruptcy estate subject to bankruptcy proceedings in which consumers would be considered as general unsecured creditors of the company.

Furthermore, Coinbase reportedly refused to disclose that it allowed US individuals to trade digital assets that—despite its knowledge and complacency—needed SEC registration as securities. As a result of the aforementioned actions, the lawsuits claim that Coinbase's public claims were always, to a large part, misleading and fraudulent.

**Coinbase** **has already been involved in a number of lawsuits and controversial scenarios. The two new lawsuits came as the SEC investigates Coinbase for allegedly trading unregistered securities. In a related complaint, Ishan Wahi, a former global product manager for Coinbase, is accused of insider trading. Wahi, on the other hand, pleaded not guilty earlier this month in a Manhattan federal courtroom to two charges of wire fraud conspiracy.**"	True	False	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	4460152	public	self			Top cryptocurrency news: Coinbase is facing two fresh lawsuits amid SEC probe	0	[]	1.0	https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/whkp78/top_cryptocurrency_news_coinbase_is_facing_two/		all_ads	6				dark	2ec8e69e-6c36-11e9-a04b-0afb553d4ea6											"Top cryptocurrency news: Coinbase is facing two fresh lawsuits amid SEC probe

He is the sole breadwinner of our family. Owns a reasonably successful small business. Controls all the money. Years of his nasty bullsh*t has left my mother psychologically traumatized, severely ill, and generally not equipped to fend for herself. 

Now for the point…

I have recently learned that he intends to leave my mother and elope with another woman. To fund this he has gradually drained all of the money out of the business, sold all assets and bought a bunch of Bitcoin. He plans to leave the country with his new girlfriend and his Ledger wallet, leaving my mother penniless and broken. 

He may be abusive… but also apparently remarkably stupid… because I’ve been able to find his seed phrase and have taken all of his Bitcoin. I now have sole and secure access to all of his money… and to be honest I’m panicking a little bit. I don’t know what my next move is. I want my mother to be provided for… and I want it all to be legal and above board. We are all based in the UK… perhaps that’s pertinent. 

I suppose I offer this to the community as a kind of thought experiment… I wonder if anyone has any advice they could give as to what I should do next??
