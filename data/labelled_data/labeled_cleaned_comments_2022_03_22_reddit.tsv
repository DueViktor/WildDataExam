It may go up and down in the sort term, but unless you’re planning on trading and playing the peaks and valleys (I’m not a trader, so I don’t get too concerned about the short term price movement) then buying bitcoin now (or dollar averaging in over a few weeks/months) is a great idea.

If you believe in btc’s future like I do, and you think that it’s value in 10+ years will be exponentially higher than it is now, what difference will a few hundred or even thousand dollar purchase price make? It’s like this: if you went back to the time when btc dropped from $4 to $2, or the time it dropped from $100 to $50 etc, would it bother you if you bought at $100 instead of $50? Probably not.

Also, don't reply any DMs, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick and read this short guide, please:

Congrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.

Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, nor next week. Statistically, it's less than four years from now. Anyone who bought Bitcoin at any point in the past and held it for 4+ years is in profit. 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least first year**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to.

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for SATs. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://amber.app/calculate-your-investment/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference.

Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at etoro, RH, PayPal or similar, get the real thing. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for very small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix

[https://muun.com/](https://muun.com/) \- Muun, simple and elegant LN wallet

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're.

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

97	[]	False		igadjeed			[]				text	t2_vy03v	False	True	"Are you asking about the basics of cryptographic signatures? A signature is created using a private key. A private key is secret to one person. The private key is paired with a public key. In asymmetric cryptography, the public key and the signature together prove that a message was signed by the owner of the private key and that the message is unaltered

&gt; Why is digitally signing needed for transferring the coin?

If a signature was not required, then anybody could spend any coin

&gt; Why does the owner sign the hash of the previous transaction instead of the previous transaction itself?

The transaction sender signs a message. The contents of the message are much more than the hash of the previous transaction. The brief answer to the question is that the previous transaction as a whole is not relevant to the spending transaction  

The actual implementation is more abstract than the description in the white paper, and much simpler, because the coin as a chain of signatures was replaced with a single link from a transaction input backwards to the coin being spent  

A transaction contains one or more inputs and one or more outputs. A transaction output is a coin. A transaction input spends exactly one coin from an older transaction  

On the blockchain, each transaction is identified by its hash. Each coin is identified by its transaction ID hash and its output number (0, 1, 2, 3 ...)  

Repeating, a transaction input spends exactly one coin. The input contains the txID hash and output number of the coin. That's the backwards link mentioned above. The input also contains the signature. The message signed by the signature is the spending transaction itself (omitting the signatures, because that would be an impossible self-reference). Importantly, each input has its own signature, and the message covered by each signature includes all the transaction outputs

&gt; What is the purpose of signing the public key of the next owner in addition to the hash of the previous transaction?

The signed message is all the inputs (omitting signatures), and all the outputs. Recall that a signature verifies two things  

*    the owner of the coin being spent  
*    that the message has not been altered  

Signing all the inputs and outputs prevents tampering

&gt; What is the purpose of the “proof-of-work”?

To achieve the purpose stated on page 1 - on-line payments with no gatekeeper - Bitcoin is a decentralized system of independently operated interconnected nodes. To be certain that every node discovers exactly the same transaction history, transactions are collected into blocks, and delayed. Proof of work is a guessing competition designed to create a delay in a system of networked nodes which has no reliable real-time clock  

The forced delay prevents nodes from having divergent transaction histories"	2137b9daa2ae7884bfd4c1d1585d4da7063f0db0	True	False					0	1647860684		0	{}	i1ilorc	False	t3_tiqqpm	False	True	t3_tiqqpm	/r/Bitcoin/comments/tiqqpm/questions_regarding_satoshi_nakamoto_article/i1ilorc/	1647860694	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]

If you can ""hold on for dear life"" you should be okay."	752e79e47a07d65cdb9b2ca73d3c5b9f33cb4de8	True	False					0	1647857845		0	{}	i1ii0bi	False	t3_tiokv7	False	True	t3_tiokv7	/r/Bitcoin/comments/tiokv7/bitcoin_and_crypto_manipulation/i1ii0bi/	1647857858	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]

As far as I know, crypto gains are not subject to capital tax in Portugal? You might not need to declare investment gains then, but don't listen to a random redditor on such important things :)  

The problem with not reporting your income right away is that perhaps many years into the future you will need to explain the source of your bitcoin holdings to the tax man, and if you don't have good explanation and good records/paper trail, you might be in trouble.  

Perhaps you can find an online place focused on taxation in Portugal specifically, if you don't want to ask an accountant.

&gt; Crowdloan allows a team to crowdsource DOT (for Polkadot slots) or KSM (for Kusama slots) to use to bootstrap its parachain auction. So Сrowdloan allows people to contribute by agreeing to lock up their own DOT (KSM) until the end of the lease. Teams can reward their contributors however they see fit, and can structure their crowdloan in various ways, hosting it either natively on Polkadot (Kusama) or on a 3rd-party platform.

Basically a project can fund their auction bid via crowdloan. Which will then be reimbursed at the end of the lease. Winning an auction can spike confidence in potential investors which could then lead to the project itself beeing scummy/rug-pulled (note: I'm in no way talking about the initial DOT invested in the crowdloan but the project itself). Making the whole parachain Eco-System look bad and thus less trustful.

Did i get something wrong? If so, please correct me. One never stops learning - especially on Polkadot.


Anyway: Thanks for your valuable input, though. You could've also esplained what you mean from the start (because I still have no idea what you are on about me needing to read how crowdloans work). Polkadot is complex enough as it is and hard for newcomers to get into.

If all 297 validators and all waiting validators go offline in the same era, then yes, governance and some manual work would be required to restart the chain. If an event occurs which causes every single validator, including the ones in Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Europe, to go offline  in the same 24-hour period, then you honestly probably have bigger problems than Polkadot block production times.

However, as long as a single validator remains, block production will continue, albeit EXTREMELY slowly, with block times for a single validator probably around 25 minutes (back of the envelope calculation here). The relay chain couldn't finalize blocks, since the requisite 2/3rds for the GRANDPA vote wouldn't be there, but you'd have BABE chain selection rules. There would likely be some even more major delays with parachain block finalization.

We actually had a ""dry run"" where something like 90-95% of validators went offline due to an OOM issue in 2021. Block production continued at a rate of about one block every four or five minutes for about an hour or so. The chain pretty much went back to normal after that event.
