As others have mentioned, don't bother with paper wallets. They have flaws that make them dangerous to use (as in, easy to lose money).

You might be able to access the money sent to the paper wallet if you in fact have the private key, but any number of things could have happened to cause you to send money to an address for which you don't have the private key. You'd need to provide more details about what you did in order for anyone to really get down to what happened. If you're willing to count that money as lost, you can just forget about it.

Use a hardware wallet (best) or a software wallet (okay for relatively small amounts). Since you're talking about cold storage, I assume you've already determined you have an amount you'd like to protect and might want to hodl.

I am not too sure why everyone makes it out to be 

Decentralization vs. Centralization…. Truthfully, we need both.
 
When things become TOO centralized it turns into a authoritarian state. Too much centralization is bad, but I would argue that too much decentralization is equally as bad.

Decentralization is great but inefficient in making executive decisions under tight time constraints. Having thousands, if not millions of peoples opinions all being voiced and reviewed would take way too much time.

Also, having ONLY decentralized financial products and no centralized products would not bode well for society, as we are prone to making mistakes and decentralization has no type of customer support/insurance currently. 

If you send funds to a wrong address using a self-custodial wallet, the money is gone for good. Nobody can help.

If you lose your private keys/seed phrase, you lose your wallet. Nobody can help.

An equal balance of both of these forces is the best fit for our future. A variety of centralized and decentralized products that are all valid options to people. 

People deserve the right to choice. This world is catered towards the rich getting richer, and the poor getting poorer. Crypto is a flip in the script to allow ANY INDIVIDUAL equal financial opportunity.

The first major outage was in September. That would have attracted the developers attention. The ones in December and January would have really focussed their efforts. If we are seeing the same type of outages in the second half of the year, then I will want to review why they have not been fixed. If there isn't a good reason, then I'd have to consider that there may be a problem. Real world load testing is always complicated in tech. So long as developers learn, and can fix these issues it's not something to worry about.

Different, unforeseeable outages will also be acceptable for me in the next year or two. But I want to see mainnet-beta turn into mainnet in a couple of years ideally, and these problems subside. If we are seeing prolonged outages every month in the not too distant future, then yes there are problems.

We do have to be aware that the outages have happened over a relatively short time period. Attackers know that if they can short SOL, then bring the network down, they will cash in. So they will attack if they can. However, long term this cat and mouse game will benefit the network - so long as the issues can actually be fixed.

On the tech side I think it's worth giving the developers some time to discover and fix issues for the potential of 65k+ TPS on layer 1. If they actually achieve this and can make the network solid Solana has a great future.

On the centralisation side - well in theory it can only get less centralised. I'm hoping the foundation spends a fair amount of their holdings in the coming years fixing the issues in the network. It's ultimately in their interest to do so. But I agree it's too high. If it doesn't come down then that's a problem. Again - wait and see.

I'd also like to see some tweaks to validator fees. Right now minimum commission is 0%. This creates a race to the bottom. There needs to be some way for newish validators to make some SOL for their efforts. I'll be keeping my eye on that as well."				1645489710	{}	hxwhu0j	False	t3_sy15k3	False	False	t3_sy15k3	/r/solana/comments/sy15k3/noob_here_couple_of_questions_related_to_sol/hxwhu0j/	1651679388.0	7	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n		1	[]

And this behavior started happening from the first time I got banned because my old name was pawdev#3437 and the BOT said that the name should not have DEV in it. Then I changed the user name but I still cannot join. It is a pity because I am really excited about Solana and would like to participate more in the project.

Our school is made entirely to discuss and promote knowledge in ecosystems like polkadot, kusama, cardano, solana, hedera, etc.  
What i want to know, is there are any way in the Polkadot to ask for support donations? In times like this, i think i can only hold more 1 year alone sustain the school, and i dont want to give up my dream about this future, and keeping teaching population about the topic.  
Im a physicist, with master degree, and drop my doctorate to open my school. I will drop some links about me and the school, if any one want to offer help i will be immensely grateful.

\*\*#51 Polkadot’s Update to 160 DOTs as minimumnomination limit: The Reason\*\*

This is a short termupgrade proposed to increase the limit of DOTs for nomination from 120 DOTs to 160, maintaining the increase of 40 DOTs that the network has had throughoutthis period of updating the nominator limit through governance. The reason forthis is the combination of the following:

Polkadot’s 0.9.16 upgrade was scheduled tocontain a fix that would completely remove the 120 DOTs limit. Thisexplained thoroughly in the monthly staking report of January 2022. After the 0.9.16 update,the nomination limit would move to a dynamic system based on demand,rather than a fixed entry barrier.Due to some unforeseen issuesarisen after the deployment of 0.9.16 in Kusama, 0/9.16 has not yet beenproposed to Polkadot.In the meantime, the numberof nominators in Polkadot has been increased to reach the 22500 limit.

As a consequence, we propose to temporarily increase the nomination limit to 160 DOTs. This allows for the permissionless chill\_othertransaction to be used and prune the number of nominators, in order to keep thenomination ecosystem of Polkadot active, whilst we wait for the enactment ofruntime 0.9.16 on Polkadot."				1645565274	{}	hy0lydw	False	t3_sylsx4	False	False	t1_hxynr9p	/r/Polkadot/comments/sylsx4/staking_dot/hy0lydw/	1652193376.0	5	True	False	Polkadot	t5_2ublt		0	[]
