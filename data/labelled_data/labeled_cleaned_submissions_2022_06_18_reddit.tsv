For the discussion let me paint the hypothetical picture.

It is year 2080. You own 100BTC and you are entrepreneurial and have an idea for innovative mean of transport. You want to make it a reality so you start to make calculations. Setting up production and processes gonna cost you 80BTC. For remaining 20BTC you buy first raw materials, hire people etc. Factory can produce 10k vehicles a year. Your margin is 20%

In first year income is 24BTC and cost of materials, fixed cost and labor etc.  20BTC/ year. 4 BTC profit yay!

2nd year:  you need to decrease prices though, because BTC amount is finite and it is more valuable every year, but raw materials prices are falling as well. Your costs were 19BTC, but income 22.8BTC (20% margin). 3.8 BTC profit.

Then situation repeats. In year 3 your profit is 3.6BTC, year 4 - 3.45BTC. After 20 years your profit is less than 1 BTC, despite the fact you are producing different, upgraded model. You start to calculate if your investment made sense. You see that on average your yearly profit was 2.5BTC. So in 20 years it was 50 BTC. You can sell your factory now for 20 BTC. You have 70 BTC now. In 20 years you produced 200,000 vehicles and lost 30 BTC on it. You wish you never did anything productive for humanity and only kept your BTC…

In short time such situation repeats. Everybody else realizes the same and quickly it appears in 2100 that computer technology staled for past 20 years, economy is not developing at all, because everybody is holding Bitcoin… only food producers and developers prosper because people need to eat and leave somewhere…

I believe everything can’t be capped to an asset that doesn’t produce anything. Bitcoin will be store of value but only to some level (maybe replacing gold).

I haven't owned bitcoin since it was around $12.

At the start I loved the idea of a new currency like this but when it started to be seen more and more as some kind of 'get rich' thing I stopped buying it and from there I watched the spikes, the dips, all of it.

Some of you have to help me here. Why is everyone losing their minds over the ""crash"" of the cost to buy bitcoin? How is this even remotely relevant to bitcoin as a currency?

Bitcoin is not an internet stock or an investment and those who try to use it as one are currently realizing why that wasn't a smart idea. Bitcoin is a currency, plain and simple. You use it to buy things, plain and simple, but for the last decade+ it's been nonstop ""HODL!!1"" mantras and essays on why you should never even think about selling or using your btc.

The same thing you could buy last week or last month or last year with bitcoin you can still buy with bitcoin. The price fluctuations in terms of how much USD it costs to buy BTC should not matter. I'm honestly vexed why the mods of this sub even allow it? The vast majority of posts I see on here relate to ""investment"" and ""cold storage"" and basically every topic that involves *not* utilizing bitcoin for its actual intended purpose. It's like if /r/podiatry was overtaken by foot fetishists.

imo the guy who bought that first pizza with bitcoin is smarter than all the crypto ""investor"" bros laughing at him combined. He actually understood what bitcoin was and got tons of people to take an interest in it and to realize that yes, you can actually buy stuff with it - it's actual currency. And yet so many of you still don't get it. You have to explain this to me. You really think this is the smart thing to do in life? To try to make a profit off of bitcoin?

Users can receive tokens for Upvote for their posts. In addition, advertising revenue generated from each subreddit will be distributed proportionally to the NFT holders of that subreddit.

Any opinions?"	is there any problem buying a hardware wallet from anything but official websites i live in brazil and i m interested in a hardware wallet unfortunately those devices are not officially shipped to brazil and the only way to get those is using external sellers like mercadolibre olx and others is there any risk someone modded the chip inside to steal information or something like that i get it i m not buying used ones i m searching for new ones never opened just not in the official website also i m a little worried about the prices they seem too low in the official website a ledger nano s for example is at least 4x more expensive comparing to brazilian non official sellers this is making me think if is really that secure in the other hand trying as much to not be arrogant but i really doubt that simply anyone can modify this chips that easy i mean is not like jailbreaking a freaking videogame console any opinions 	0.002369058085605502	0.9887700080871582	0.9248536825180054	0.007668686099350452	0.007933590561151505	0.550563633441925	0.07886200398206711	8.352189411198196e-07	0.38987019658088684	0.0016352845123037696

They aren't comparable directly, Bitcoin is not competing with the banking system, is competing with a part of it which is transactions, it's competing with something like Visa transactions, sepa and swift, that's it. Then arguable with the dollar but I will not get into that, I will just get into some facts based on personal experience. Read bellow.

I used to be a COBOL dev on the banking sector and even though that doesn't give me the whole picture I have a good sense for the amount of constant processed that are running 24/7, just the whole credit risk systems are a huge beast running on mostly IBM mainframes that do millions of processes per day, really astronomical stuff, that thing is like a spider web constantly analyzing clients data to understand their risk profile and send alerts and updating data warehouse databases that go to other banks and other banking systems and the government and so on.

And credit risk is just a part of it which is the one I work most of the time. Then there's business like factoring, confirming and leasing, these also are constantly taking care of loans and payments of between producers and sales corporations, handling emails and notifications of every kind, calculating interests and much more on a scale that is absolutely mind blowing.

It's something people in crypto really fail to grasp, they will look at visa transfers and compare that to number of Bitcoin transactions per year and so on... It's nonsense, that's nothing compared to what happens in a bank, most doesn't use visa, it's just SWIFT and SEPA transfers and most are done in bulk after millions of transactions happened internally and then basically the processes run that call the SWIFT transfer functions and basically updates the database on the other side.

This is why even though Bitcoin consumes more than credit card transactions it doesn't consume more than the banking system because it can't even replace it. The banking system is doing totally different things and Bitcoin is just too simple to do all the things it does...

This also means that it's complete nonsense to compare the energy the banking system consumes against just a transaction system that is Bitcoin. Banks aren't just transaction systems, are whole business doing many things.

Eventually what can happen is that some of these baking systems start using Bitcoin for some of their transaction processes. Bitcoin will, and it's not create to, replace them as a whole. So comparing saying that Bitcoin spends way less than the banking system to endorse it makes no sense because what you are intrinsically doing is comparing the energetic cost of a house full of appliances (bank with all it's different systems including transactions as simply a part of many things) to the energetic cost of a fridge (bitcoin that just handles transactions).

Floky"	i fell in love with an idea not the prospect of making moon money in 2020 i took every penny i could lose and bought one bitcoin for 9k i have since then hold on to this bitcoin and will keep holding on to it because i love the idea of bitcoin i bought bitcoin because i truely believe in it and will either reise with it or sink with it but i ll be holding on to my btc until the very end may it be sweet or bitter money is nice but we all know the saying money doesn t buy you happiness a world in which i m free from the grip of governments and rich dogs is to me a happier world so fuck the money i ask of you instead of looking at the price of bitcoin look at what bitcoin is and could become cheers floky	0.0008766856044530869	0.9952665567398071	0.8977805972099304	0.062189728021621704	0.9971656203269958	0.26175498962402344	0.10248735547065735	8.514988394381362e-07	0.1839447170495987	0.004780779592692852

This subreddit seems like a good place to ask questions freely &amp; without judgement (hopefully).  


My goal is to invest in Bitcoin (long-term, meaning: even years. Everything takes time), but first I want to learn about it more, analyze the risks before making any move. Note that I haven't made an investment in my life, but was always interested in it, I just did not know how and where to start. Now I feel like I should give it a chance. I would appreciate if you could provide me some information about what is Bitcoin, the history behind it and the possible future. What it means for regular people, what will it mean to society as a whole.  


Things that I know is that Bitcoin could fundamentally change the perspective of how we view and use money in the future, and that any crypto, including BTC is digital money, but I guess there is much more. You can also drop/suggest some useful sites, reliable sources where I can gather as much info as I can to make my decision.

You and your lovely wife share a Bitcoin wallet, we'll call it the ""common"" wallet, and you both know the 12 word key.  One day her mother decides you aren't good enough, divorce time.  The judge says the wallet shall be divided, with half the Bitcoin going to her exclusive wallet(where only she has the keys), and half to yours.  And so it is done.  

But then one day, a tenant who was making automatic payments to the common wallet, accidentally sends another one there.  Well, both you and the ex have keys to that wallet, and as we know NYKNYC.  So...who gets the Bitcoin?  It would come down to who is quickest on the trigger, wouldn't it?  Or whoever sees it first or is made aware of it in time to quickly log in, and send that Bitcoin to their exclusive wallet.  

My question is - for situations such as this, can a rule be set up in say, Ledger Live app, wherein any payment received in the wallet can be automatically and immediately sent to another wallet?  So that you don't have to worry about the ex stealing it.  Because you can never stop her from having the keys, she's already got those.  And so any payment made to that wallet, you've got to constantly worry about it and be checking it, to ensure you don't lose any money.  Right?

Political uncertainty and PR campaigns

The problem I have is: I can't afford a hardware wallet. Actually I can, but I'd have to spend all my BTC on that, so it'd be kinda of useless. Yeah, I don't have much money, but I live in a third world country, so the little I have is significant.

Now, I don't mind too much leaving it on the exchange company, but I'd prefer having my own seed. But I also don't want to use a hot wallet.

Considering that, I had an idea. I'd generate a key offline, write it down on a paper, and then delete whatever I used to generate that key. I'd also of course save the address of that wallet. Now, as far as I know, a hardware wallet is only a means of storing the key offline and sign transactions. With this idea, I wouldn't be able to sign transactions, but it would be a safe storage, right? And in the future, whenever I want to get that money back, I could just restore my wallet and spend it, right? The only problem I see is that I wouldn't be able to generate a key without leaving any track at all, would that be a big problem?

If someone could help me, telling me if I'm right or wrong, and why in the latter, I'd appreciate. Also, if you have any tips for my situation, or any links to useful information, they are welcomed.

My secondary hobby is buying and flipping cars. It's almost like playing with stocks, except I can expect profits within weeks instead of years. To summarize, I travel out of state to buy cars that are priced lower than market value. I bring these cars back home locally and flip them for profit. It's not a bad gig if you don't mind the travel time and expenses, but the end profits more then make up for it. I'm also a hobby mechanic, so I am usually pretty good at sorting out junk. So it's not like I'm gambling with a clunker and getting stuck with it if it happened to break down on me. Anyways, I'm veering off subject now... But with flipping vehicles, I usually continue to work with my profits and purchase another car, rinse and repeat with flipping, etc. 

Well, my dilemma is continuing my tried and true method of flipping cars for profits, or investing this money in a full bitcoin with some change.

The problem as I see it is that if you set up a mobile / desktop wallet to self custody then you have to write the 12 word phrase down somewhere. So if you keep it at home, someone may locate it -  **Physical Risk**

OK so we are told to get a hardware wallet so your keys are not online. Well guess what you still have to write down the 12/24 words somewhere. - **Physical Risk**

So one of my other friends took a photo of his words and put in amongst 10 years of photos on google drive... yes this may be a fairly effective way of hiding it but now you have - **Digital Risk** 

So as I understand it a hardware wallet like ledger can be restored onto another wallet or hardware device using the 12/24 words so its really important to keep these safe.

MultiSig you say... Got it! except you have the same above issues for multisig for each wallet plus you need to store a configuration file that also has to be kept safe. - **Digital &amp; Physical Risk**

Which brings me to Multisig using a 3rd party which seems to have some advantages.

There are Services like [Keys.casa](https://Keys.casa) that enable you to have a 2 of 3 multisig with their server as the 3rd signiture... You could combine a key on your phone with a hardware wallet and them having a key. This seems to mitigate both Digital &amp; Physical Risk as even if someone got access to your phone they would also need access to your hardware wallet or recovery phrase to get your bitcoin... but its not free its a paid service.

Also there is Blockstream Green Wallet and while it doest seem to get that much love you can use it with a Ledger hardware wallet in a 2 of 2 multisig. This service enables you to use 2FA such as a yubikey or other typical 2FA. 

As far as I can tell the Blockstream Green wallet is the best option for free as you could safely write your 12/24 wallet recovery down in a locked note stored on your computer as even if someone got access to it and was able to restore the hardware wallet they would not see any bitcoin as they would also need to have access to the 2FA ... something like a yubikey. Which of course then becomes easier to distribute backup keys and hardware wallets to geographically seperate locations.

Yes its true its not permission less and this means a 3rd part is involved if you take this route but as 99% don't trust them self with self custody Green Wallet combined with Ledger Hardware Wallet and Yubikeys appear to me to be the best option for the slightly paranoid.

## Thoughts on Solana in a Bear Market

Solana managed to stay relatively quiet during another chaotic week in crypto.

The network didn’t crash again and our token isn’t worth ~~Terra~~ zero.

Hands up if you breathed a sigh of relief?

Okay, okay, chill. We’re not *all* supposed to put our hands up!

And while there was Solana news to get to, we thought we’d take the chance to drop our thoughts on this bear market from a Solana perspective.

After all, we’re SOL maxis, right?

https://preview.redd.it/et980hw916691.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=712232d649e44bd9b6be738f347f06fcdab5e403

You see, I’m relatively new to crypto in a hands-on way.

I’ve followed Bitcoin since 2017, so *technically* this isn’t my first bear market.

But I wasn’t actively using Bitcoin like I have been with SOL in the past 6-9 months.

Staking, trading NFTs, exploring DeFi has all been fun.

Watching SOL rise and dip and rally had us feeling good.

Until you stop and realize that no matter how many gains you’ve made, we’re still down \~90% from our all time high.

F\*CK!

And while everyone else in crypto/web3 land is pointing to previous bear markets, it suddenly occurred to me - we don’t have a previous bear market to compare Solana to…

Double F\*CK!!

 This means two things:

1. We *literally* don't know what could happen next
2. We really are *that* early

This is what Solana's all time price chart looks like: 

https://preview.redd.it/uw3bwqbg16691.png?width=765&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b971507869c24d2916b9d16937b53e039332996

It's almost a perfect bell curve. *Up, up, up. Down, down down.*

Compared to Ethereum's all time price chart:

https://preview.redd.it/s7zd4efk16691.png?width=764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d62ac69957dc2955d7e3b1fe3bffcde9c087ec70

They've had more dips and dives than a dodgeball team.

But because of that, they can look back to look ahead.

And it results in tables that paint a reassuring picture, like this one from our frens at the Milk Road:

https://preview.redd.it/gc3hxv8p16691.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da2d4d713bace05a89ea5636664c9dac14ff8688

The narrative here is that the previous high becomes this time's low.

When you zoom out and look at it like that, it's easier to maintain conviction.

*But what do you do if your previous high was zero?*

We look elsewhere to paint our version of a reassuring picture.

It's commonly said that bear markets are when the building happens. Well Solana is still building.

Updates continue to roll out to improve the network. Those who are actually using the blockchain are raving:

https://preview.redd.it/eiczcv1s16691.png?width=464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d731201f942d62ed8731f373bb1f3b76da5efdf

https://preview.redd.it/hkcpda3w16691.png?width=497&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec7d7c39986ea675ea1bb0072eb126ed40102189

And a look deeper shows more positive signals. As Mert points out: 

https://preview.redd.it/5exqdoyz16691.png?width=507&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c06a74b111c2e6b20bf9ca991143ca2e2854fe4

These charts show us three positive signals:

1. Users - the number of active wallets hasn't dropped relative to token price
2. Activity - users are still transacting inside the ecosystem with some activity (NFTs) trending upward
3. Developer activity - hasn't slowed down, builders are still building and shipping

Sure, it's easy to point to a few charts and make it look good. But there's more positive signals than just charts. 

Last week we looked at Solana's $100M investment fund that's being deployed in South Korea.

Capital is still flowing into the system, allowing more building to take place.

This investment only adds to those good looking charts above.

Of course, this could all be wrong and we could still go to zero. We are *that* early, remember.

But I don't see an ecosystem that's hanging on for dear life. I see an ecosystem showing real belief in what is being built. 

Yes, a massive run up towards the tail end of a historic bull run looks bad when that bull turns into a bear.

No, that doesn't paint a true picture of what is happening inside the Solana ecosystem.

It's true that markets go up and down. This is the first time in Solana's history we've seen the market go down.

So far, we're painting a picture that doesn't look too bad.

And maybe we'll look back on this downturn one day as the point where Solana's foundations were truly laid.

## Extra Sweets

New move-to-earn project Walken will launch next week. Whether it's stepping or walking, we probably won't see the highs of move-to-earn again for a while.

Solana's new gas fees model is nearly ready.

Phantom and MetaMask teamed up to fix a potential security bug that could've affected all browser wallets. Like Batman and Robin. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, that was a little different. What did you think?

👍 Loved it

*GM and welcome to SOL Sweet. Did you remember to add sugar to your coffee? Good. Now sit back, we've got something a little different this week...*

## Thoughts on Solana in a Bear Market

Solana managed to stay relatively quiet during another chaotic week in crypto.

The network didn’t crash again and our token isn’t worth ~~Terra~~ zero.

Hands up if you breathed a sigh of relief?

Okay, okay, chill. We’re not *all* supposed to put our hands up!

And while there was Solana news to get to, we thought we’d take the chance to drop our thoughts on this bear market from a Solana perspective.

After all, we’re SOL maxis, right?

https://preview.redd.it/et980hw916691.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=712232d649e44bd9b6be738f347f06fcdab5e403

You see, I’m relatively new to crypto in a hands-on way.

I’ve followed Bitcoin since 2017, so *technically* this isn’t my first bear market.

But I wasn’t actively using Bitcoin like I have been with SOL in the past 6-9 months.

Staking, trading NFTs, exploring DeFi has all been fun.

Watching SOL rise and dip and rally had us feeling good.

Until you stop and realize that no matter how many gains you’ve made, we’re still down \~90% from our all time high.

F\*CK!

And while everyone else in crypto/web3 land is pointing to previous bear markets, it suddenly occurred to me - we don’t have a previous bear market to compare Solana to…

Double F\*CK!!

 This means two things:

1. We *literally* don't know what could happen next
2. We really are *that* early

This is what Solana's all time price chart looks like: 

https://preview.redd.it/uw3bwqbg16691.png?width=765&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b971507869c24d2916b9d16937b53e039332996

It's almost a perfect bell curve. *Up, up, up. Down, down down.*

Compared to Ethereum's all time price chart:

https://preview.redd.it/s7zd4efk16691.png?width=764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d62ac69957dc2955d7e3b1fe3bffcde9c087ec70

They've had more dips and dives than a dodgeball team.

But because of that, they can look back to look ahead.

And it results in tables that paint a reassuring picture, like this one from our frens at the Milk Road:

https://preview.redd.it/gc3hxv8p16691.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da2d4d713bace05a89ea5636664c9dac14ff8688

The narrative here is that the previous high becomes this time's low.

When you zoom out and look at it like that, it's easier to maintain conviction.

*But what do you do if your previous high was zero?*

We look elsewhere to paint our version of a reassuring picture.

It's commonly said that bear markets are when the building happens. Well Solana is still building.

Updates continue to roll out to improve the network. Those who are actually using the blockchain are raving:

https://preview.redd.it/eiczcv1s16691.png?width=464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d731201f942d62ed8731f373bb1f3b76da5efdf

https://preview.redd.it/hkcpda3w16691.png?width=497&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec7d7c39986ea675ea1bb0072eb126ed40102189

And a look deeper shows more positive signals. As Mert points out: 

https://preview.redd.it/5exqdoyz16691.png?width=507&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c06a74b111c2e6b20bf9ca991143ca2e2854fe4

These charts show us three positive signals:

1. Users - the number of active wallets hasn't dropped relative to token price
2. Activity - users are still transacting inside the ecosystem with some activity (NFTs) trending upward
3. Developer activity - hasn't slowed down, builders are still building and shipping

Sure, it's easy to point to a few charts and make it look good. But there's more positive signals than just charts. 

Last week we looked at Solana's $100M investment fund that's being deployed in South Korea.

Capital is still flowing into the system, allowing more building to take place.

This investment only adds to those good looking charts above.

Of course, this could all be wrong and we could still go to zero. We are *that* early, remember.

But I don't see an ecosystem that's hanging on for dear life. I see an ecosystem showing real belief in what is being built. 

Yes, a massive run up towards the tail end of a historic bull run looks bad when that bull turns into a bear.

No, that doesn't paint a true picture of what is happening inside the Solana ecosystem.

It's true that markets go up and down. This is the first time in Solana's history we've seen the market go down.

So far, we're painting a picture that doesn't look too bad.

And maybe we'll look back on this downturn one day as the point where Solana's foundations were truly laid.

## Extra Sweets

New move-to-earn project Walken will launch next week. Whether it's stepping or walking, we probably won't see the highs of move-to-earn again for a while.

Solana's new gas fees model is nearly ready.

Phantom and MetaMask teamed up to fix a potential security bug that could've affected all browser wallets. Like Batman and Robin. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, that was a little different. What did you think?

👍 Loved it

👎 Stick to the news, bro!

Hey Everyone,

We've been heads down building the most feature-rich multisig platform on Solana. We're thrilled to announce we've partnered with Solend, so you'll now able to earn yields directly from a secure multisig platform on Solana. 

This is a feature requested from many platforms and teams, who are interested in earning additional yield however want to do so from a secure multisig platform. Through our Snowflake Safe App Store, teams will be able to select Solend to deposit funds into the reserve and mint cToken. cTokens are a *yield-bearing deposit receipt*, which means they are tradeable whilst also earning interest on the underlying token.
