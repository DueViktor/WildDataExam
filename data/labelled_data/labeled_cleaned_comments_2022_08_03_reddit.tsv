That is quite a statement, I'm a gamer and have been for some time, I'm fairly immersed in gaming news and this just doesn't ring true to me at all. In fact what you wrote looks like a pre prepared press release and makes me want to fall asleep.

People have always made money through gaming, it is nothing new. I sold characters I had levelled up in wow in 2005/2006, people were selling items in other games well before this.

There is very little chance gaming companies are going to agree on sharing the same blockchain so things can be traded equally. The whole NFT thing in gaming was immediately jumped on by companies but it just looked like any other marketing campaign. 

I'm yet to see any use for Ethereum beyond hosting financial instruments and making the act of financial trading more seamless and less centralised.

To add onto the great answers below with my also limited understanding:

There are bridges, and then there are things like Hop/Orbiter, which are not strictly bridges. Let's call them ""bridges"".

Real, canonical bridges lock up your token on L1 Ethereum in the bridge contract, and mint a fake version of it on the L2 or alt-L1. Then when you want to withdraw back to L1 Ethereum, it burns the fake token and gives you back the original token on L1. This is why if a bridge contract gets hacked, all of the fake tokens are now valueless, because the real tokens backing them are gone.

Hop/Orbiter/etc. work differently. These ""bridge"" protocols have *liquidity* on both L1 Ethereum and the L2/alt L1. This liquidity consists of real tokens on L1, and fake tokens on the other chain *that have already been bridged via the official bridge at an earlier date*. This liquidity is owned by *other people*, often the operators of the ""bridge"". When you throw your L1 coin into this ""bridge"", they'll simply claim that coin for themselves, adding it to the L1 liquidity pool. They don't mint a new token on other chain corresponding to it, but rather, just hand you that chain's version of the token from their liquidity pool that's already present. When you ""bridge"" back, this process is reversed. The fake token is *not* burned on the other chain, it just goes back into their liquidity pool there.

So a few key distinguishing factors of these ""bridges"" versus real bridges:

* They do not lock up and unlock, or mint and burn, tokens. Rather, they just accept and hand out liquidity.

* They can work instantly, because the tokens already exist. No need to wait through lengthy challenge periods that official bridges on optimistic rollups often have.

* The liquidity is not guaranteed to be present. Sometimes these ""bridges"" run out of liquidity because a lot of people moved in one direction or the other, and then they can't be used until the liquidity is replenished.

* The liquidity is owned by others. If a ""bridge"" contract gets hacked, it's their liquidity providers who take the L. It has no impact on the value of the fake tokens on the L2/alt L1 - they still retain their 1:1 backing that was created by the canonical bridge contract.

* These ""bridges"" often charge fees, because the liquidity providers on them ain't plopping down significant capital out of the goodness of their hearts.

So from your perspective as a user, it's actually a much worse disaster if a canonical bridge contract (like Nomad...) gets hacked, because that rugs the entire supply of the fake token on the other chain. A ""bridge"" getting hacked just means you can't use it anymore until they fix the bug and add more liquidity.

On the other hand, ""bridges"" tend to be more centralized. There's no guarantee they hand you back liquidity on the other side of the ""bridge"" - you have to trust them. Same deal with real bridges onto alt-L1s. Real bridges onto true L2s do not have the same centralization issues, and the only worries there are smart contract bugs.

Hope that helps!"	822efb6bbf9770e75c2cf093133371edae59345b	True	False					0	1659445585		0	{}	iimzjj3	False	t3_we2f92	False	True	t3_we2f92	/r/ethereum/comments/we2f92/how_are_l2_bridges_more_secure_than_cross_chain/iimzjj3/	1659445596	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]			credit to u interweaver on his comment here https reddit com r ethfinance comments we2rnd daily general discussion august 2 2022 iimw8uj to add onto the great answers below with my also limited understanding there are bridges and then there are things like hop orbiter which are not strictly bridges let s call them bridges real canonical bridges lock up your token on l1 ethereum in the bridge contract and mint a fake version of it on the l2 or alt l1 then when you want to withdraw back to l1 ethereum it burns the fake token and gives you back the original token on l1 this is why if a bridge contract gets hacked all of the fake tokens are now valueless because the real tokens backing them are gone hop orbiter etc work differently these bridge protocols have liquidity on both l1 ethereum and the l2 alt l1 this liquidity consists of real tokens on l1 and fake tokens on the other chain that have already been bridged via the official bridge at an earlier date this liquidity is owned by other people often the operators of the bridge when you throw your l1 coin into this bridge they ll simply claim that coin for themselves adding it to the l1 liquidity pool they don t mint a new token on other chain corresponding to it but rather just hand you that chain s version of the token from their liquidity pool that s already present when you bridge back this process is reversed the fake token is not burned on the other chain it just goes back into their liquidity pool there so a few key distinguishing factors of these bridges versus real bridges they do not lock up and unlock or mint and burn tokens rather they just accept and hand out liquidity they can work instantly because the tokens already exist no need to wait through lengthy challenge periods that official bridges on optimistic rollups often have the liquidity is not guaranteed to be present sometimes these bridges run out of liquidity because a lot of people moved in one direction or the other and then they can t be used until the liquidity is replenished the liquidity is owned by others if a bridge contract gets hacked it s their liquidity providers who take the l it has no impact on the value of the fake tokens on the l2 alt l1 they still retain their 1 1 backing that was created by the canonical bridge contract these bridges often charge fees because the liquidity providers on them ain t plopping down significant capital out of the goodness of their hearts so from your perspective as a user it s actually a much worse disaster if a canonical bridge contract like nomad gets hacked because that rugs the entire supply of the fake token on the other chain a bridge getting hacked just means you can t use it anymore until they fix the bug and add more liquidity on the other hand bridges tend to be more centralized there s no guarantee they hand you back liquidity on the other side of the bridge you have to trust them same deal with real bridges onto alt l1s real bridges onto true l2s do not have the same centralization issues and the only worries there are smart contract bugs hope that helps 	0.0028275090735405684	0.9891138076782227	0.822934627532959	0.03891744092106819	0.008420511148869991	0.5402107238769531	0.10610389709472656	8.245488629654574e-07	0.3762958347797394	0.008600202389061451

My biggest complaint about SOL is the mercenarial actors that operate within its ecosystem.  This mercenarial capital takes on three forms:

&amp;#x200B;

* Predatory tokeonomics for certain SOL ecosystem projects.  Everyone is probably familiar with the predatory high-FDV + low circulation tokeonomics.  I think the principle actors behind these projects should take a cue and burn many of the locked tokens.
* Mercenarial backers.  SOL attracts many powerful backers.  Some are powerful, performative, and loyal (SBF/FTX); others, like Multicoin, will fund SOL while at the same time funding competitors and encouraging SOL ecosystem projects to migrate to those competitors.
* Acceleration of ponzi-scheme implosions (probably the least damaging).  This capital has a strong edge over retail due to expertise in the financial markets, and generally accelerates the demise of yield farming and other opportunities for retail.  But, these opportunities were transient anyway and so mercenarial actors merely accelerate what was going to happen.

Overall, I think these are growing pains that will improve as the crypto space matures.   The bear market + bad press from predatory economics will force out many cash grabs and force future projects to have more realistic tokeonomics.  

Unlike others, I see developments like SAGA and Solana Spaces as being huge net positives and long-term plays that will eventually build a powerful brand and moat for Solana.  And the continual technical iteration from Anatoly and the Solana core team is very promising and I think they'll be able to achieve their vision to scaling the blockchain to the point where it's useful.

In fact, I think they are nearly at the point where it's quite useful for many things already.  Obviously I think they're going to keep on plowing ahead, but Solana is fast enough where you can use it for many interesting applications and I think other future faster chains are (1) not going to improve the experience sufficiently to switch; and (2) will have their most promising tech adapted by SOL anyway."	b78aab56a54ffb7ca22c66a10562fe7b24a3e53d	True	False					0	1659470049		0	{}	iioqlw6	False	t3_wdz7bf	False	True	t3_wdz7bf	/r/solana/comments/wdz7bf/what_is_your_best_criticism_of_solana/iioqlw6/	1659470063	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]			i like sol a lot enough to make many millions on the way up lose many millions on the way down and to keep on buying due to ultra high conviction that it will succeed in the long term my biggest complaint about sol is the mercenarial actors that operate within its ecosystem this mercenarial capital takes on three forms amp x200b predatory tokeonomics for certain sol ecosystem projects everyone is probably familiar with the predatory high fdv low circulation tokeonomics i think the principle actors behind these projects should take a cue and burn many of the locked tokens mercenarial backers sol attracts many powerful backers some are powerful performative and loyal sbf ftx others like multicoin will fund sol while at the same time funding competitors and encouraging sol ecosystem projects to migrate to those competitors acceleration of ponzi scheme implosions probably the least damaging this capital has a strong edge over retail due to expertise in the financial markets and generally accelerates the demise of yield farming and other opportunities for retail but these opportunities were transient anyway and so mercenarial actors merely accelerate what was going to happen overall i think these are growing pains that will improve as the crypto space matures the bear market bad press from predatory economics will force out many cash grabs and force future projects to have more realistic tokeonomics unlike others i see developments like saga and solana spaces as being huge net positives and long term plays that will eventually build a powerful brand and moat for solana and the continual technical iteration from anatoly and the solana core team is very promising and i think they ll be able to achieve their vision to scaling the blockchain to the point where it s useful in fact i think they are nearly at the point where it s quite useful for many things already obviously i think they re going to keep on plowing ahead but solana is fast enough where you can use it for many interesting applications and i think other future faster chains are 1 not going to improve the experience sufficiently to switch and 2 will have their most promising tech adapted by sol anyway 	0.002797792199999094	0.9884431958198547	0.16958941519260406	0.05503154546022415	0.9939934611320496	0.5981277823448181	0.09988605231046677	8.254174872490694e-07	0.297512412071228	0.0313042588531971
