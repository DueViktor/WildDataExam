There are different types of L2s, if you want to find out more, you can check them out [here](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases/) in the section Layer 2 Scaling. Generally there are 2 L2 solutions: zk rollups and optimistic rollups, there are more in development and research.

Next, the merge, a short explanation: the current PoW chain will merge with the PoS Beacon Chain (which has been running since December 2020). Forcing all current miners to become validators. There's more to the exact things that will happen, if you want to get in depth I recommend watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuLyZaty9iI&amp;t=554s), also if you want to get more technical you can watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5p0TB77flM&amp;t=853s).


You can think of Ethereum as the App store. Eth L1 is the infrastructure and L2s &amp; dApps are the apps living on it. Now imagine if Apple never updated their App Store Infrastructure, it wouldn't have run so smoothly, right?
