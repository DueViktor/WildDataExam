All real goods and services are denominated in fiat. Thus its fiat price instability means it can't store value properly to trade for goods and services.

Now, I do believe BTC can BE a good store of value. But I think its development over time has lost its way to being crypto as originally envisioned.

1) Some of BTC's most recent and serious pain come from its ASIC mining. ASIC mining means miners are professional and should live in low energy cost countries. The negative consequence is ASIC makes Bitcoin mining excessively centralized. The concentration of mining in specific geographic locations also means Bitcoin gets extremely sensitive to political movements happening there. Take the example of FUD from China, Kazakhstan, and Russia.  If Bitcoin mining is more decentralized and diversified across the globe, you won't have a massive concentration of Bitcoin stacked in just a few mining operations. And when their local authorities crack down on them, they won't have the massive amount of BTC to dump and crash the market.

2) Many Wall Street money managers see BTC as not better than trading cards. BTC has no value to them if they don't see exponential growth. They don't believe in crypto. They can easily pour money in as they can rug pull out. That is what we are seeing right now. On Coinbase, you can see the vast majority of the activity is buying, yet BTC is still falling. The Wall Street whales are dumping.

If you want the masses to adopt BTC, then you got to get rid of these Wall Street whales. As long as you have these whales here, they will manipulate BTC to move like an 8X leveraged Invesco QQQ index fund. In a way, I am happy BTC is bleeding right now.

For the most part I stuck with BTC and ETH. Started watching Pomp on his YouTube channel, Lunch Money, during the pandemic. 

It was a great ride. I bought sub 10k, 20k, and a lot in the upper 40s. The summer crash was nbd, I diamond handed through the whole thing. Never got tempted and honesty didn’t even check this sub. 

I think the environment dropping to 30k was much different back then. Now the macro sentiment is overshadowing anything. The jury is still out whether or not BTC is a hedge for inflation. We’re excited for Wallstreet to adopt Bitcoin, but we can’t be surprised if they see it as just another asset with higher volatility they can make a quick profit for their investors. Remember, they’re are traders. I know most of this sub has 5+ year outlook, but they don’t have the luxury or option to diamond hand. They have to report every quarter and if they start slipping they’ll be out of a job.  

It’s true, everyone says they’re never going to sell, especially when things go up. That’s usually when you take bigger risks. It’s an amazing feeling. You were right about the asset. You feel invincible. “This things going to 98k by the end of November.”

When prices start dropping, you think it’s just setting up support for the next leg up. But then it continues to drop. You see profits slip, remain unfazed, from triple digits to single digits. “Damn if I just sold the top and bought back I’d have X% more in my stack”. You’re still a permabull. Diamond hands. Then the stock market has a big sell off after the Fed meeting minutes, you glance at Bitcoin as you see it barely moved.  “Wow, it’s so nice to see Bitcoin hold strong and start decoupling from the stock market.”  Then it sells off from 55k to 43k in a matter of hours. “Damn those levered position.”  It’s they’re fault right?

Things are chopping next few weeks. You’re hopeful. “If I can just get one pump, I’ll sell.”  Then Netflix’s earnings come out.  That’s it. There’s no way Bitcoin isn’t coming down with it. That was it. That was my signal to sell.  

Do I think Bitcoin is here to stay. Absolutely. I will most definitely buy it back. Right now I don’t see the demand.  My advice is don’t listen to others on what you want to do. HODL if you want, sell if you want. It’s your decision.  Write it out. Why you want to hold or why you want to sell.  If you’re not sure, educate yourself.

2nd one: **$13.8k-$6.4k**

3rd one: **$10.5k-$3.8k**

4th one: **$64.9k-$28.8k**

If Bitcoin gets to $34.5k, it'll be the 5th time I experience a ≥50% dip.

What did I do every time? **I bought and accumulated.**

Would I buy again? **Already bought and will keep buying if we keep going lower.**

1) If you're planning to hold your BTC long term, keep calm and relax.  Don't worry about these price fluctuations. This has happened several times in crypto and  it will happen again but eventually I believe BTC will be fine. It's always been a roller coaster ride and will always be. 

2) If you're new to crypto and bought it at a higher price, dollar cost average is one of the really good strategies. Perhaps set aside say 5% of your salary to buy every week

3) If your family members or friends are mocking at you or think you are crazy to buy right now, please ignore the fear and FUD. Infact this is really a good time to buy rather than when whole market is bullish and BTC is pumping. 

4) Please don't keep looking at charts all day. If you buy in spot market and put it in some interest earning account, let it be there and go do your normal daily activities,  watch a movie, catch-up with friends and family and relax. There's no point looking at the charts every 2 hours and panicking. Market will recover eventually.

it's already valued at $578.59 which is worth $577.10 btc! to the moon!

haha true story. with the state of the market, i told my mom it was time to get in on the action. if you want the full story, read on:

my tale begins when bitcoin first started making the news, around 10 years ago is when it entered my radar. i was immediately curious and started learning because technology cool.

i pretty quickly discovered bitcoin fountains (which are apparently banned on this sub so don't ask me about them) and made a wallet and started farming. i was young and it was a neat waste of time. eventually i got bored and forgot about it.

years later, bitcoin is all over the news again, all time high, etc. i wonder about my coins, get back into my wallet, boom, i forget how much exactly but like, 50-100 usd just sitting there. i didn't even have a bank account so i just bought stuff on the internet from vendors that accepted bitcoin. admittedly, i bought myself 1 month of reddit gold just to see what it was.

i really just wanted to use it and support businesses accepting it because that's how you get acceptance. i had no interest in investing, just wanted to play with magic internet money. eventually there's just a few dollars and cents in the wallet, and i forget about it again.

well, again, years go by, bitcoin news, ath, i find my wallet again and boom, $200+ available. amazing. i honestly can't figure out the math on this one. looking back, comparing prices and trying to remember when i did it, none of it adds up, but i spent the money, this time i did cash out because i had a real world emergency. checking the wallet was actually a last ditch effort just to see and it saved my butt.

i did check the wallet around 69k and there wasn't much.

okay, side story, somewhere during this time, my family started a business. we have always been poor, no investments, no generational wealth of any sort. my family of 5 worked for free to build a business out of our childhood home, and it worked. we're not rich by any means, but we are more comfortable.

once, during a profitable time, we had an extra $10,000 and we were deciding how to use it for the business. i suggested buying 1 btc, as it had just hit 10k, and was shut down pretty quick. about a week later, btc had about doubled.

i was never rude about it or anything, but my mom recently told me how terrible she felt for not listening to me. when btc was pushing 69k, she again reiterated that she wanted to get in if i ever thought there was a genuine opportunity.

well, today was a day. i woke up, read some news, and texted her that i thought it was time. when she woke up, she responded. i was clear that she could lose every penny she paid, that the price could continue to go down for a long time before it ever goes back up. i called it an entertainment fee, but that the more she spent, the more entertainment she would get. i also explained how the exchange owned her coins and that she would need to do extra steps to have actual ownership, which she hasn't done yet.

i expected $10-$100 just to get in on the hype, but joked that 4 figures would flex on plebs. she didn't know what that meant but kept hitting the buy button until her cc got limited at 6 $100 purchases plus fees.

don't worry, i explained diamond hands, we ain't no paper handed family. im just really happy we have bitcoin now.

thanks for reading, see you again on the moon."	my mom just spent 617 on bitcoin she s stoked about her 600 in bitcoin https i imgur com 3nc1son jpeg it s already valued at 578 59 which is worth 577 10 btc to the moon haha true story with the state of the market i told my mom it was time to get in on the action if you want the full story read on my tale begins when bitcoin first started making the news around 10 years ago is when it entered my radar i was immediately curious and started learning because technology cool i pretty quickly discovered bitcoin fountains which are apparently banned on this sub so don t ask me about them and made a wallet and started farming i was young and it was a neat waste of time eventually i got bored and forgot about it years later bitcoin is all over the news again all time high etc i wonder about my coins get back into my wallet boom i forget how much exactly but like 50 100 usd just sitting there i didn t even have a bank account so i just bought stuff on the internet from vendors that accepted bitcoin admittedly i bought myself 1 month of reddit gold just to see what it was i really just wanted to use it and support businesses accepting it because that s how you get acceptance i had no interest in investing just wanted to play with magic internet money eventually there s just a few dollars and cents in the wallet and i forget about it again well again years go by bitcoin news ath i find my wallet again and boom 200 available amazing i honestly can t figure out the math on this one looking back comparing prices and trying to remember when i did it none of it adds up but i spent the money this time i did cash out because i had a real world emergency checking the wallet was actually a last ditch effort just to see and it saved my butt i did check the wallet around 69k and there wasn t much okay side story somewhere during this time my family started a business we have always been poor no investments no generational wealth of any sort my family of 5 worked for free to build a business out of our childhood home and it worked we re not rich by any means but we are more comfortable once during a profitable time we had an extra 10 000 and we were deciding how to use it for the business i suggested buying 1 btc as it had just hit 10k and was shut down pretty quick about a week later btc had about doubled i was never rude about it or anything but my mom recently told me how terrible she felt for not listening to me when btc was pushing 69k she again reiterated that she wanted to get in if i ever thought there was a genuine opportunity well today was a day i woke up read some news and texted her that i thought it was time when she woke up she responded i was clear that she could lose every penny she paid that the price could continue to go down for a long time before it ever goes back up i called it an entertainment fee but that the more she spent the more entertainment she would get i also explained how the exchange owned her coins and that she would need to do extra steps to have actual ownership which she hasn t done yet i expected 10 100 just to get in on the hype but joked that 4 figures would flex on plebs she didn t know what that meant but kept hitting the buy button until her cc got limited at 6 100 purchases plus fees don t worry i explained diamond hands we ain t no paper handed family im just really happy we have bitcoin now thanks for reading see you again on the moon 	0.002585071139037609	0.9886547327041626	0.001946760923601687	0.012301296927034855	0.9941267967224121	0.9970861077308655	0.1473895162343979	8.573624086238851e-07	0.13717786967754364	0.04692978784441948

The Reason is: Incentive.

Almost 100% of all critics on “Crypto” is not a critic on Bitcoin or the fundamentals of Crypto, it is a critic on human nature.

The Space is wide open and unregulated. This means a lot of bad players have free reign over elaborate scams and schemes. This makes the hole space look bad, but most educated with Bitcoin’s fundamentals, history, and possibilities now and in development, will see through most of the critic being oversimplified nonsense. This happens in many spaces where the macro is too complicated to grasp completely.

While I will not state that I know everything or do grasp anything related to crypto, good or bad, In moments like this I try to remind myself why I think the space will succeed. Not all coins, but the fundamentals.

This one thing for me is: Incentive. 

When you look at how humans buy, react, consume, or work - all is fueled by one thing. Money. In my perspective, the future runs on instant payments on Chains for work or goods. Get your payment or pay others with decentralized, unlimited, instant, and nearly free transactions. When you can pay someone by the minute or get paid by the minute we will enter a phase of hyper-productivity. 

The incentive here is on both sides – with the consumer getting his money instantly for his work done, not by the end of the month but now. On the other hand, the big and small producers / service providers equally want a way to instantly charge someone for service or good, without the need to login or remembering your password.

Connected, ultra-secure multi-signature wallets and the lightning approach with node watchtowers are an extremely good solution for this future.

Payments will be instant, extremely cheap, worldwide and everyone will benefit.

The cheapest, fastest and most effective solution will always win with time.

While in the last few days the price tanked and the sentiment for Crypto in general seems at a low, I always remind myself why I believed in this space in the first place.

The Reason is: Incentive.

Almost 100% of all critics on “Crypto” is not a critic on Bitcoin or the fundamentals of Crypto, it is a critic on human nature.

The Space is wide open and unregulated. This means a lot of bad players have free reign over elaborate scams and schemes. This makes the hole space look bad, but most educated with Bitcoin’s fundamentals, history, and possibilities now and in development, will see through most of the critic being oversimplified nonsense. This happens in many spaces where the macro is too complicated to grasp completely.

While I will not state that I know everything or do grasp anything related to crypto, good or bad, In moments like this I try to remind myself why I think the space will succeed. Not all coins, but the fundamentals.

This one thing for me is: Incentive. 

When you look at how humans buy, react, consume, or work - all is fueled by one thing. Money. In my perspective, the future runs on instant payments on Chains for work or goods. Get your payment or pay others with decentralized, unlimited, instant, and nearly free transactions. When you can pay someone by the minute or get paid by the minute we will enter a phase of hyper-productivity. 

The incentive here is on both sides – with the consumer getting his money instantly for his work done, not by the end of the month but now. On the other hand, the big and small producers / service providers equally want a way to instantly charge someone for service or good, without the need to login or remembering your password.

Some friends expect crypto currency to establish social justice to bridge the gap between rich and poor! The rich are not going to loose rich and the poor are not going to get rich with bitcoin or other digital currencies, no…

The essence of wealth As the rich get richer and the poor poorer and this is inevitable, you seem to have unrealistic expectations!

Consider crypto currency as just a currency as its name implies, like the dollar, it is not right to expect it to be productive!

What does the printing and distribution system of the dollar have now ?! Nothing, only produces valuable paper and no one expects to produce wheat or bake bread !!!

But crypto currencies have an important purpose: to eliminate the need to trust a third party or entity in many matters of the world, because experience has shown that this trust has been abused!

Summary The most important functions of crypto currencies are decentralized electronic financial exchanges.

Just getting into the Solana ecosystem. I found this project called MemeCake.io that started off on another chain, and apparently they are building the first ever multichain social NFT marketplace. Does Solana or any other chain currently have anything like this? They have an upcoming snapshot for their IDO token drop, so I'm thinking of picking up some of their NFTs right now so that I can qualify for it. As far as I understand, I'm thinking their IDO token is something like Binance's BSC token with utility and staking abilities. Also is $0.004/token cheap for IDO?

I am using a Ledger Nano S (firmware 2.1.0, which I believe is the latest) + Solflare wallet. I am trying to unstake SOL (""Native SOL Staking""), but it appears that I am unable to do so.

I press the ""UNDELEGATE"" button.

I then sign the transaction on my Nano S. 

This message is then shown for a short moment (&lt; 1 minute):

Network Instability

Incident status: Identified

Solana mainnet beta is experiencing high levels of network congestion. This is related to issues previously identified that engineers have been working to improve and resolve, starting with the 1.8 release. 1.8.12 was specifically aimed at improving issues of program cache exhaustion, which are largely responsible for recent performance degradations. Developers have made lots of progress on this, but the work is not complete. The last 24 hours have shown these systems need to be improved to meet the demands of users, and support the more complex transactions now common on the network. 

The current issue experienced by validators is due to excessive duplicate transactions. Engineers have just released 1.8.14, which will attempt to mitigate the worst effects of this issue. These forthcoming releases are aimed at improving the state of the network, with more improvements expected to roll out in the next 8-12 weeks. Many of these features are currently live on Testnet, where they are being rigorously tested.

Degraded Performance	Mainnet Beta - Cluster"	solana problems again for those having issues sol is experiencing issues again network instability incident status identified solana mainnet beta is experiencing high levels of network congestion this is related to issues previously identified that engineers have been working to improve and resolve starting with the 1 8 release 1 8 12 was specifically aimed at improving issues of program cache exhaustion which are largely responsible for recent performance degradations developers have made lots of progress on this but the work is not complete the last 24 hours have shown these systems need to be improved to meet the demands of users and support the more complex transactions now common on the network the current issue experienced by validators is due to excessive duplicate transactions engineers have just released 1 8 14 which will attempt to mitigate the worst effects of this issue these forthcoming releases are aimed at improving the state of the network with more improvements expected to roll out in the next 8 12 weeks many of these features are currently live on testnet where they are being rigorously tested release 1 8 14 is now available at https github com solana labs solana releases tag v1 8 14 time posted jan 22 17 55 utc components affected degraded performance mainnet beta cluster	0.0027200966142117977	0.9882493019104004	0.41981780529022217	0.15668295323848724	0.007862931117415428	0.25262466073036194	0.23169560730457306	8.552596000299673e-07	0.5150070786476135	0.024267779663205147

so yesterday I minted meta force, which some of you may know was a scam. I've minted one for 0.095 ETH and bought another for 0.066 ETH, so together I lost roughly 400 USD. I want to share some lessons I learned from this mistake to help you avoid a similar fate. If you can, I would be very grateful if you could send me a small amount of ETH or SOL to reduce the pain I'm going through right now (it would mean a lot to me). 

Eth: 0xe8e24BD21d524f38ADAe51DC2adAB17d724CA050

Sol: 2kEw2vS5KPDcEd1WPEcMS7fNK7hekBMeyTt6e2vmPkwy

Here's what I've learned:

As I said,  the project that scammed me was Meta Force. It was advertised as ""the Asian BAYC"" or ""the next bluechip"" and when I look back, I feel kinda ashamed that I fell for it.

The first sign was the style of promoting. There were 3-4 main accounts with a fairly high number of followers and the style was ""I’m giving away this amount of ETH, so reply to this tweet, and BTW a new cool project Meta Force is minting today, definitely the next bluechip"".

Secondly, there were other signs that something is wrong- no twitter for this project, strangely looking website, the ""former Naruto artist"" wasn’t doxxed, the promotions were saying things like: ""the next 100x, I’m expecting 10 ETH floor at least"", etc. You get the idea.

Also when I looked up mentions on Twitter, there were only two groups of people- these 3 shilling accounts saying it's gonna go to the moon, and then on the opposite side were a few good guys warning others before this scam.

In short, the lessons I learned are:

-Don’t believe someone on Twitter just because they have BAYC as a profile pic and 100k followers.

-Beware when the artist is not doxxed

-Project without a twitter account is very shady

-And most importantly, DYOR before you buy

I hope this will help at least a few of you guys. Also, other scam happening today by the same people is called hype ape club, so don't fall for it."

Solana was this cool party everyone was talking about. Flashy NFTs, actually stuff going on on the chain, high tps, low fees. And yeah all this cool ideas and concepts. When it comes to „hype“ Solana was the one in 2021. Everyone wanted to go to the party.

You can play with it and that’s fun, and it performed better then most other chains in 21, so we got money. That’s nice.
