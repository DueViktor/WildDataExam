When I hear ""70% of the miners are censoring a transaction"" I assume collusion must be happening between them because otherwise, as you say, any attempt at censorship is ineffective. Without the ability to orphan the 30%'s blocks (which collusion would be required for) the only thing that the 70% can do is leave those transactions out of *their own* blocks, which I consider such a mild inconvenience that it doesn't really merit the term ""censorship."" To me, ""censorship"" implies an effort to suppress a piece of information completely rather than passively ignoring it while others communicate it freely.

This is also why I was unimpressed with the ""OMG they're censoring Tornado"" kerfuffle a little while back. Some validators are refusing to include Tornado transactions in their blocks, but they're not fighting with validators that *do* include them. Not really something that warrants a panic (though worth implementing countermeasures against where possible, someday).

You are comparing this situation with a 51% attack.

Let me lay the difference with this case.

In the scenario of a 51% attack, the hashing power needs to be able to work cooperatively on the alternative block chain, this means, a single miner with that hash power or a set of miners interconnected and sharing blocks between them. 

This way, they don't need the neutral non-mining nodes to relay their blocks while their alternative chain is not longer than the honest one.

When this miner or interconnected miners outpace the honest chain, the neutral non-mining nodes will start to relay this now longest chain, and the 51% attack would have succeeded.

But in our 70% scenario I am assuming that these miners are not the same entity, they are NOT directly connected, and they can't share an alternative chain throught the neutral nodes because they will nor relay their censored block if it arrives after the not censored one (wich will happen eventually).

This would be the case of a country that mandates all their unrelated and not directly interconnected miners to censor specific transactions. They would need to accept the not-censoring blocks for the reasons explained."	adde30c2c5e4d2a5ad9991dce2b869822990a96e	True	False					0	1663920714		0	{}	ipkoxw0	True	t3_xkt209	False	True	t1_ipklp8p	/r/ethereum/comments/xkt209/what_is_some_weakness_of_pos_against_pow/ipkoxw0/	1663920728	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

Bad TXs must be blocked. Otherwise, at TPS 100K, the entire node becomes a dumpster. Of course, EIP1559 will try to stop this by deliberately raising gas costs. However, at the TPS 100K, EIP1559 does not have a ""reasonable"" standard for what level of traffic to raise gas costs.  
  
\&gt;&gt; **and can opt to block these kinds of transactions if they wish.**  
  
This is actually the most misleading part. Satoshi or Buterin WISHED. But they couldn't find a way. At least preliminary or in real time. If they had found a way, something like EIP1559 wouldn't have even appeared. This problem, contrary to what it seems, is very fundamental and difficult to solve.  
  
If you don't have enough space, you can sell it through an auction. However, if the space is wide enough and the speed is fast enough, the auction is now just unreasonable. It's no different from raising the price of water or air.  
  
The cause of all these problems stems from the use of gas costs as security tools. Gas costs should be used as gas costs itself and security should be achieved through genuine security tools."	1fe99877634b43b0c35564ba1a7ac32ef5a6659f	True	False					0	1663971832		0	{}	ipne7q2	True	t3_xm1nei	False	True	t1_ipmmnib	/r/ethereum/comments/xm1nei/about_tps_100000_in_l2/ipne7q2/	1663971848	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

This is one of the reasons I suggested the analogy I did; it mostly isn't an oppressive conspiracy that people are obligated to use combustion based transportation, and there are good reasons that's how things are, but it is still not a choice, and there are real problems with this and good reasons to want more choices.

&gt;If you resent having to use your non-favorite payment system to buy something... hold up, let me get my tiny violin to play. I'm really sorry the rest of the world hasn't embraced your ponzi token of choice.

The way you are framing this is pretty weird. Have you read the specific problems OP and many other people in this thread are describing, that are unique to centralized payment processor services?

But, again, this is additional business for the same cost, not replaced business. 

&gt;without needing to work.

False again. They are working. They are providing the same work result as beforehand with miners. Why are you still pretending they don't work, exactly? 

&gt;In the case of PoW the resources consumption is performed by machines, and there are no idle persons consuming value without working.

There is no idle person consuming value without work in validation either. They are working. They're just way more efficient at their work. Work efficiency matters in economics. 

Or else, no one would use Excel or computers and we'd all do all computations by hands, for lack of efficiency seems to you to equate a more efficient economy. 

&gt;The PoW schema is superior, for this reason, the economy is more efficient, and the network security too.

First, the economy is less efficient in PoW, specifically because PoW is less efficient at its work than PoS. You've said it yourself when pretending validators ""don't work"". It's just that they're requiring way less efforts for the same result. 

Second, network security is way lower in PoW, because it is controlled by the L1 consensus rather than the L0 consensus (contrary to PoS) and because it needs way less funds, specifically due to economies of scale, to attack a PoW network than to attack a PoS network.

With economies of scale, PoW ensures a more centralized attacker is always more efficient with its funds than several less centralized consensus defenders. This ensures defending the network is done at a disadvantage. The only thing that protects PoW networks is the sheer quantity of funds needed, but it's still at a disadvantage for defenders whatever they do. And once the attack is achieved, there's no solution against it except having way more funds than the attacker, aka not having an achieved attack in the first place."	3bc2c988c4dc3c4288a1b0ce2d73be533a8ebba6	True	False					0	1663919910		0	{}	ipko3tg	False	t3_xl5us3	False	True	t1_ipkj258	/r/ethereum/comments/xl5us3/if_pos_consumes_9998_less_of_resources_why_didnt/ipko3tg/	1663919923	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

Tradfi is exactly what you asked for. It's not off topic at all.

Again, you're asking for regulated ETH and USDC. It specifically means you're asking for not being able to buy ETH and USDC. So, yep, you can't have it through tradfi, because you can't have access to most performing assets in tradfi.

&gt;So, you were intentionally being misleading, or obtuse.

&gt; If 70% of PoW validators censor certain transactions, the other 30% can still generate blocks to include them in the blockchain.

&gt; The censoring 70% could ignore that block containing the censored transaction, and continue working on the previous one. At some point, they would probably find a new block generating 2 alternate heads of the chain (one censored and one uncensored).

&gt; **The problem is that the non-mining nodes would only rely the first one they receive (the uncensored), and store any other candidate just in case it becomes the longuest chain.**

&gt; This would avoid the 70% censoring to receive their censoring block and continue working on the alternate chain.

I've highlighted the problem spot. Non-mining nodes *don't care* what order they received a node in. The whole point of how a PoW blockchain works is to make it so that a node can be presented with alternate forks and be able to make a decision between those two forks as to which is the canonical chain in a manner that is globally true without needing to coordinate with each other.  There's no globally authoritative time ordering in which blocks reach nodes. If two miners should happen to produce blocks at the same time and broadcast them, some nodes would receive one block first and some would receive the other block first. Ordering the blocks by the *total amount of work done to produce them* rather than the time that you happened to receive them is the only way you can be sure that you're picking the same block as the canonical head as every other node in the world.

If 70% of the hashpower is saying ""block A is the real head of the blockchain"" and the other 30% is saying ""no, block B is,"" it doesn't matter one whit whether block A or block B got to a node first. The 70% is going to overwhelm the 30% in amount of work being applied to its preferred fork and it's going to ""win.""

If the 70% have decided to censor a transaction and orphan any blocks that the 30% produces that contain it, then **the 70% wins**. That's an unavoidable feature of PoW. If it didn't work that way then PoW wouldn't work at all."	bc8f03703898f31fa559741f2af295b13057fb7a	True	False					0	1663915596		0	{}	ipkjccm	False	t3_xkt209	False	True	t1_ipki7z9	/r/ethereum/comments/xkt209/what_is_some_weakness_of_pos_against_pow/ipkjccm/	1663915608	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

No, only long term and with very different ways of consuming the resources. Don't confuse money with resources or you'll end up falling for the broken window fallacy. 

&gt;There is a security budget that happens to be used differently, but that happens to consume the same amount of resources (and thus the same ecological impact).

No, the two aren't the same at all. Equating resource allocation with similar ecological impact is obviously false. You can allocate resources in a way that has huge ecological impact just as much as in a way that has nearly no ecological impact. Equating all activities and allocations with all others would mean to support that no investment can be better than any other.

Not in the same resources, not at the same time, not with the same people benefiting from it.

&gt;Indirect usage is not a problem except that you have not control of the ecological impact

You have a much, much better control on the environmental impact than with a mechanism where you have absolutely no control at all on the environmental impact like PoW was: let's be reminded that, in PoW, the only measure that dictates energy consumption is token price, which then determines how much of each energy type can be consumed. Once unreliable renewable energy surplus are all bought, it forces consumption of non renewable, high environmental impact, cheap coal. And it goes up really fast.

&gt;Remember that what creates wealth is work+capital, and with PoS there are people that don't work but consume.

False. They do work. They produce exactly the same work result as miners.

You're the one who's not thinking it through here. Do you really think a PoW blockchain can simply be hijacked by 30% of the hashrate, with the 70% being helplessly orphaned by those big powerful 30%ers? Even if the blockchain *was* measuring depth based solely on the number of blocks,  the 70% group is producing blocks *more than twice as fast* as the 30% group. They'll quickly surpass them in both total work *and* number of blocks produced.

Nodes don't ignore blocks that they're sent that are *verifiably from a longer chain* than the block they think is currently the head of the chain. That's how reorgs happen, nodes receive a block that's from a longer chain and they discard the conflicting one they had previously.

If it were really possible, why has a blockchain never been hijacked by a 30% attack? Or a 20% attack, or a 10% attack, why would 30% even be the ""floor""? It makes no sense.

No. The ""longest chain"" is the chain with the *most cumulative work*, not the chain with the largest number of blocks.

[Here's another article](https://learn.saylor.org/mod/book/view.php?id=36380&amp;chapterid=19028) that addresses this more directly. 

&gt; Because the blockchain is a decentralized data structure, different copies of it are not always consistent. Blocks might arrive at different nodes at different times, causing the nodes to have different perspectives of the blockchain. To resolve this, each node always selects and attempts to extend the chain of blocks that represents the most Proof-of-Work, also known as the longest chain or greatest cumulative work chain. By summing the work recorded in each block in a chain, a node can calculate the total amount of work that has been expended to create that chain. As long as all nodes select the greatest-cumulative-work chain, the global bitcoin network eventually converges to a consistent state. 

There are many articles out there, this is rather fundamental to how PoW blockchains function. If they didn't function this way then a blockchain would accidentally fragment into multiple forks simply due to blocks being produced ""simultaneously"" by different miners and spreading to different nodes, never merging back together into a single canonical chain. They *have* to be able to reorg like that or the Byzantine generals problem isn't solved.

The only thing that can't be faked in PoW is the *amount of work* that's been done to bring a chain to a particular state.

The amount of work of a blockchain is measured on the number of blocks, the longuest one have more work.

But if you receive one block at height 1000, you validate it and relay it and wait for the block 1001. If at this point the 70% of miners generate an alternative block for height 1000, there is no way to determine that this block has ""more work"" than the previously received.

In this case, the node ignores the new block number 1000 and the rest of the censoring miners never receive it, so they cannot grow the alternative chain.

The 70% of miners are not in a parallel universe, they are a vast MINORITY compared to the amount of nodes (non minin nodes) that are validating and relaying blocks.

The only way would be to interconnect all those 70% of miners that would share their censored blockchain, but it would be a fork. The original blockchain would not be censoring transactions.

That's just not the case, though, and I think is the key misunderstanding you have here. If a block with more work behind it comes along, it supersedes the lesser-work blocks even if those blocks were ""seen first."" It's called a [chain reorg](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/chain-reorganisation). If a node accepted a block and then along comes another alternate block that has more work behind it, the node goes ""whoopsie-doodle, I had the wrong chain"" and accepts the work-heavier one instead. It doesn't ignore it.

There's nothing that limits a chain reorg to just one block.
