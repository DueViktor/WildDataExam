56	[]		BuddyGuyBruh						[]	"I have been in bitcoin since 2014 and I am still hodling. I will not cash out for fiat however I do see myself actually USING the network to purchase things for myself. Till then, I am not EVER going to cash for fiat, and todays actions by Canadian government have made my resolve even stronger.

I do not think this is fascism, I do think this is an over reaction of the government and the precedents set today can very well lead to similar totalitaristc governments such as the ones in Nazi Germany. 

I also agree with the general message of the truckers. 

I think that COVID has been used as a political tool and at this point the measures and mandates do not make sense from a science perspective. I do not believe that we are at this point in the pandemic saving any significant lives by keeping these measures and in fact I believe that we are harming more than saving. I believe people are loosing their jobs and lively hoods, addictions and overdoses are skyrocketing, the mental health and obesity is at its worst, the children that were young and needed to socialize in their early years will probably have lasting effects from this and the list goes on.

[This interview with Brian Peckford, the last living first minister that has participated and signed the Charter Of Rights and freedoms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdhFuMDLBDM) is eye opening and very well articulated of my grievances. I know that JP is a very controversial person, but in this interview he is very concise and the content is solid.

I am scared that we are giving into fear and panic ( or the media is convincing people) to the point that we are allowing the governments to erode our rights and freedoms unnecessarily.

I support the peaceful protests that truckers set out to do. I watched this turn from a fringe minority to an emergency act real quick. I have seen in real time the slandering from the media and fabrications while also being able to see live feeds that disprove the narratives.

However, I also think that the truckers are in the wrong on two main points:

1. Blocking Borders
2. Honking 

I agreed with the message of the last years BLM protests BUT I was not a fan when they started rioting and looting, destroying public property etc. In the same way I am not in favour of truckers blocking the border, tanking the economy and encroaching on other peoples livelihoods by disturbing the supply chain. I do not think it is act of terrorism but I do not also agree with it. Even though I support the message and I think it was very effective to get the governments attention, doing it for such a prolonged time, they are not in the right there.

The second, honking, it was funny at first. However, they are essentially harassing the residents from Ottawa for no reason. I can understand making noise for a bit during the day, but the truck horns are LOUD. Onto of that they were going to far by bringing train horns on the back of their pickups. That is just straight up unbearable and doing it 24/7 is just going to get people angry and rightfully so.

With all this being said, I do not think they are at the level of disturbance as last years BLM protests. I do not think that this was justifiable to use the emergency act and this sets a horrible precedent for future bad actors to use it for any ""emergency"" they see fit. 

As others have pointed out, people are selfish. When they see their ""enemies"" or people they do not agree with politically be squeezed by the government they cheer and are happy, not realizing at all that they allow themselves to be exposed now to the same treatment in the future when they are having a non approved government opinion.

Going after peoples money is evil. 

When the government is able to tell me what I can or cannot do with my money, I do not really have that money. They are just allowing me to have it at the moment, but only to be used for approved uses. That is not freedom.

This should be a wake up call for people that we need a decentralized form of money that we do not rely on trust from anybody but the underlying mathematics. Today you may agree with the government and want to cut off the funding for the truckers and take their possessions. However, know that in the future this can then be used against you in the same way when you have an opinion that doesn't alight with the status quo."				1644911370	{}	hx0enju	False	t3_ssn9z8	False	False	t1_hwz3u39	/r/Bitcoin/comments/ssn9z8/breaking_canada_expands_money_laundering_laws_to/hx0enju/	1647686314.0	13	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj		0	[]		[]	text	t2_89g9d0q	False	False														i have been in bitcoin since 2014 and i am still hodling i will not cash out for fiat however i do see myself actually using the network to purchase things for myself till then i am not ever going to cash for fiat and todays actions by canadian government have made my resolve even stronger i do not think this is fascism i do think this is an over reaction of the government and the precedents set today can very well lead to similar totalitaristc governments such as the ones in nazi germany i also agree with the general message of the truckers i think that covid has been used as a political tool and at this point the measures and mandates do not make sense from a science perspective i do not believe that we are at this point in the pandemic saving any significant lives by keeping these measures and in fact i believe that we are harming more than saving i believe people are loosing their jobs and lively hoods addictions and overdoses are skyrocketing the mental health and obesity is at its worst the children that were young and needed to socialize in their early years will probably have lasting effects from this and the list goes on this interview with brian peckford the last living first minister that has participated and signed the charter of rights and freedoms https www youtube com watch v edhfumdlbdm is eye opening and very well articulated of my grievances i know that jp is a very controversial person but in this interview he is very concise and the content is solid i am scared that we are giving into fear and panic or the media is convincing people to the point that we are allowing the governments to erode our rights and freedoms unnecessarily i support the peaceful protests that truckers set out to do i watched this turn from a fringe minority to an emergency act real quick i have seen in real time the slandering from the media and fabrications while also being able to see live feeds that disprove the narratives however i also think that the truckers are in the wrong on two main points 1 blocking borders 2 honking i agreed with the message of the last years blm protests but i was not a fan when they started rioting and looting destroying public property etc in the same way i am not in favour of truckers blocking the border tanking the economy and encroaching on other peoples livelihoods by disturbing the supply chain i do not think it is act of terrorism but i do not also agree with it even though i support the message and i think it was very effective to get the governments attention doing it for such a prolonged time they are not in the right there the second honking it was funny at first however they are essentially harassing the residents from ottawa for no reason i can understand making noise for a bit during the day but the truck horns are loud onto of that they were going to far by bringing train horns on the back of their pickups that is just straight up unbearable and doing it 24 7 is just going to get people angry and rightfully so with all this being said i do not think they are at the level of disturbance as last years blm protests i do not think that this was justifiable to use the emergency act and this sets a horrible precedent for future bad actors to use it for any emergency they see fit as others have pointed out people are selfish when they see their enemies or people they do not agree with politically be squeezed by the government they cheer and are happy not realizing at all that they allow themselves to be exposed now to the same treatment in the future when they are having a non approved government opinion going after peoples money is evil when the government is able to tell me what i can or cannot do with my money i do not really have that money they are just allowing me to have it at the moment but only to be used for approved uses that is not freedom this should be a wake up call for people that we need a decentralized form of money that we do not rely on trust from anybody but the underlying mathematics today you may agree with the government and want to cut off the funding for the truckers and take their possessions however know that in the future this can then be used against you in the same way when you have an opinion that doesn t alight with the status quo 	0.002496111672371626	0.9869800806045532	0.9295551776885986	0.015501136891543865	0.009464607574045658	0.9956870675086975	0.07997092604637146	8.152519512805156e-07	0.28090164065361023	0.010263185016810894

For example, in a Muslim-controlled State, the Muslims do not pay tax, but only pay the mandatory charity levy (""zakaat"") for the poor.

Only non-Muslims, usually Christians, pay personal taxes to the State (""jiziah"").

This is fair for various reasons.

One such reason is that **Christians believe that they should pay tax** to the ruling mafia. Therefore, there rests a religious obligation on the ruling mafia to force them to do so.

Muslims do not believe this, and are therefore exempt from paying personal tax.

So, yes, **death and taxes** are unavoidable, but only for Christians.

If you convert to Islam, you will not have that problem. At that point, you switch to believing that **""jiziah""** is only meant to burden non-Muslims, who must of course pay. You, on the other hand, you simply do not pay.

According to other discussions, they used a third-party custodial mixer (Helix), which just happened to be the one busted by the FBI in 2020 for its relationship to Alphabay (also busted). It's likely the FBI has the Helix transaction history, which de-anonymizes the thieves' mixing transactions, and leads to the exchanges where they tried to cash out

&gt; Is it that a coinjoin is only as good as the number of participants?

Right

&gt; for example if 10 people take part, all law enforcement have to do is monitor all 10 outputs from that coinjoin?

Wrong. The obfuscation of the transaction graph comes from two things. The first is the contradiction to the common view that a transaction's outputs are linked to its inputs. They're not.

143	[]		itsnotthatdeepbrah						[]	"&gt;money is generally a note of debt in societies and is used to settle debts owned - bitcoin cannot do that except for fringe cases

This is objectively incorrect. Bitcoin is simply a global, open source, decentralised ledger that keeps track of who owes what. On what basis is this only useable in fringe cases when it’s quite literally the ONLY open sourced monetary network that anyone in the world can plug into?

&gt;money must be a medium of exchange - which again, Bitcoin is for only fringe uses

Medium of exchange depends on scalability, liquidity and adoption. Bitcoin has objectively increased its standing in all 3 areas successfully for over a decade and now adoption is even rivalling that of the internet itself. There has never been a more faster adopted network in human history.

&gt;As a store of value bitcoin is less predictable than any currency used today

Not really, 1 BTC = 1 BTC. Whether we’re talking 5 years or 50 years down the line, this will never change. 1 BTC = 1 BTC and 1 Satoshi = 1 Satoshi. Will 1 USD be worth 1 USD in 5, 10 years? The purchasing power of the global reserve currency has decreased by over 90% in the last 100 years. How is this more stable than bitcoin?

&gt;Even using lightning network transactions with bitcoin is slower 

Bitcoin allows cross border final settlement with a digital bearer instrument in minutes, for virtually negligible fees. This has never been achievable ever before in human history. Do you think your VISA payments include final settlement when you pay? Do you even know how long it takes to settle global payments with the current legacy system? It can takes days, even weeks in some instances. Lighting now allows final settlement international remittances in seconds with almost 0 fees. In what world do you think Western Union is somehow better where fixed costs can charge up to 50% in some instances for remittance fees?

&gt;blah blah blah 3rd party apps blah blah

 3rd party apps do not settle transactions that’s handled on the base layer of the network. 3rd party apps allows everyone in the world to plug into and interface with an open source network and provides competition for the best developers to create the best interfaces. Bitcoin does not need these apps to work or function.

There are a variety of subreddits devoted to recording and studying this such as r/ActiveMeasures, r/Disinfo and the sub that I'm part of - r/trollfare. We've gathered a collection of resources on our [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/trollfare/wiki/index), the most relevant of which relate to how trolls, bad faith actors and Active Measures agents will try to control and steer an online discussion [8](https://pastebin.com/raw/irj4Fyd5) [9](https://medium.com/s/story/a-field-guide-to-bad-faith-arguments-7-terrible-arguments-in-your-mentions-ee4f194afbc9) [10](http://www.iftf.org/fileadmin/user_upload/images/DigIntel/SR-2002_IFTF_Biology_of_disinformation_tk_042618.pdf).


And here are some user analysis tools that you can use to check on suspicious accounts:


* https://reddit-user-analyser.netlify.app/ is the simplest and fastest user analysis tool that I know of. It provides a list of the top 100 subreddits a user has posted in and their most commonly used 100 words, excluding articles (the/a) and prepositions (in/on/etc.) I think. There are also graphs of their comments and submissions by date. You can use this information to identify users who bolster their reputation in karma farming subs like 'freekarma4you' as well as commonly upvoted subs like 'aww', 'pics', or any popular sports teams. There is obviously nothing wrong with someone posting on sites like that in general, but if an account only posted replies like ""cute bunny"" or ""go ManU!"" for years and then suddenly start spouting exclusively kremilin talking points then you might have reason for suspicion! 


* https://redditmetis.com/ - Is another site that analyzes a user, similar to reddit-user-analyser but in addition to displaying where and when they post and get karma it also will actually use their posts to extract information they have stated about themselves such as their employment, nationality etc. This shouldn't be taken as reliable as not only can it make mistakes but it also has no way of knowing if a user has lied. Some information has a # link next to it which leads you to the comment from which the information was extracted, this lets you consider context and judge it's veracity for yourself. Another great feature of redditmetis is the activity heatmap, showing when in the day a user posts. If they claim to be from Canada but they only post in working hours Moscow time then that may raise a red flag...


* https://www.redditinvestigator.com/ - Similar to the first two however much slower to generate the analysis. I'd suggest giving it a try, although I use it much less than the others. The one unique feature is that it extracts the website links used in submissions to show you if the user frequently links to certain sites. In the context of this conflict look for sites like RT (Russia Today) and Sputniknews being shared a lot.


* https://camas.github.io/reddit-search/ - This site lets you search all comments a user has made on a certain sub, within a certain timeframe and/or including keywords. If you wanted to find all the posts made by account X in the sub Y that included the term Z you could do so. 


* https://redditcommentsearch.com/ - Does similar to the above but with less search options. No fields to limit date range for example, but otherwise perfectly useful. Sometimes simplicity is good.


* https://www.unddit.com/ - Allows you to view deleted comments from discussions, assuming that the comments wasn't removed too quickly. You'll often see users arguing in what appears to be bad faith, spreading disinformation, then when someone disproves their bullshit or calls them out the bad-faith user may delete their comments, so when they try something similar again no-one can see that they shouldn't be trusted. This site provides you with a counter to these reputation management techniques, allowing you to view and share evidence of previous manipulation attempts that the user may think they have scrubbed from the record.


* https://subredditstats.com/subreddit-user-overlaps - You can use this site to compare subreddit userbase similarities, as a kind of meta analysis of what you're doing by just checking profiles and useful if you see a subreddit that you don't recognize or start to see a pattern with lots of accounts posting in a certain sub.


I hope that this lot is helpful, we're entering a period where I'm expecting disinfo here to really ramp-up, hopefully by working together we can counter it to a certain extent. Please, please copy and paste this comment wherever you like, especially when you see threads with suspicious accounts. Don't call them out directly as this may get you banned in some subs, and don't reply to them even to argue as the primary role maybe just to derail discussion and therefore crack a consensus that is forming. Instead just post this in reply to the person they are interacting with, or just wherever you like really.

pastebin com raw irj4fyd5 9 https medium com s story a field guide to bad faith arguments 7 terrible arguments in your mentions ee4f194afbc9 10 http www iftf org fileadmin user upload images digintel sr 2002 iftf biology of disinformation tk 042618 pdf and here are some user analysis tools that you can use to check on suspicious accounts https reddit user analyser netlify app is the simplest and fastest user analysis tool that i know of it provides a list of the top 100 subreddits a user has posted in and their most commonly used 100 words excluding articles the a and prepositions in on etc i think there are also graphs of their comments and submissions by date you can use this information to identify users who bolster their reputation in karma farming subs like freekarma4you as well as commonly upvoted subs like aww pics or any popular sports teams there is obviously nothing wrong with someone posting on sites like that in general but if an account only posted replies like cute bunny or go manu for years and then suddenly start spouting exclusively kremilin talking points then you might have reason for suspicion https redditmetis com is another site that analyzes a user similar to reddit user analyser but in addition to displaying where and when they post and get karma it also will actually use their posts to extract information they have stated about themselves such as their employment nationality etc this shouldn t be taken as reliable as not only can it make mistakes but it also has no way of knowing if a user has lied some information has a link next to it which leads you to the comment from which the information was extracted this lets you consider context and judge it s veracity for yourself another great feature of redditmetis is the activity heatmap showing when in the day a user posts if they claim to be from canada but they only post in working hours moscow time then that may raise a red flag https www redditinvestigator com similar to the first two however much slower to generate the analysis i d suggest giving it a try although i use it much less than the others the one unique feature is that it extracts the website links used in submissions to show you if the user frequently links to certain sites in the context of this conflict look for sites like rt russia today and sputniknews being shared a lot https camas github io reddit search this site lets you search all comments a user has made on a certain sub within a certain timeframe and or including keywords if you wanted to find all the posts made by account x in the sub y that included the term z you could do so https redditcommentsearch com does similar to the above but with less search options no fields to limit date range for example but otherwise perfectly useful sometimes simplicity is good https www unddit com allows you to view deleted comments from discussions assuming that the comments wasn t removed too quickly you ll often see users arguing in what appears to be bad faith spreading disinformation then when someone disproves their bullshit or calls them out the bad faith user may delete their comments so when they try something similar again no one can see that they shouldn t be trusted this site provides you with a counter to these reputation management techniques allowing you to view and share evidence of previous manipulation attempts that the user may think they have scrubbed from the record https subredditstats com subreddit user overlaps you can use this site to compare subreddit userbase similarities as a kind of meta analysis of what you re doing by just checking profiles and useful if you see a subreddit that you don t recognize or start to see a pattern with lots of accounts posting in a certain sub i hope that this lot is helpful we re entering a period where i m expecting disinfo here to really ramp up hopefully by working together we can counter it to a certain extent please please copy and paste this comment wherever you like especially when you see threads with suspicious accounts don t call them out directly as this may get you banned in some subs and don t reply to them even to argue as the primary role maybe just to derail discussion and therefore crack a consensus that is forming instead just post this in reply to the person they are interacting with or just wherever you like really thank you so much for your time i appreciate that this isn t directly on topic for this sub and i really appreciate you taking the threat of misinformation and manipulation seriously enough to read through this lot

(-) Using marinade does lock up your SOL in the sense that it becomes locked into a separate program (the marinade stake pool program) and not under your ownership anymore.  But, you do get mSOL in return which is a liquid asset and which can be traded back for SOL for a small fee.  So in that sense you can quickly get SOL back if that's what you want.  But just for technical correctness, your SOL does get locked up.

(-) If you are just going for pure yields, mSOL is generally not the best.  As an example, with the SOL-USDC pool on orca.so, your SOL is also ""not locked up"", because you can get your SOL (and USDC) back at any time by withdrawing from the pool, and the yields are higher than the equivalent mSOL-USDC pool.

My points are only that depending on what you are going for (how much liquidity?  How much risk?  How much returns?  How much ""helping the network""?) mSOL + defi systems may or may not be the best choice.

438	[]		molebat						[]	"&gt;Are the DEXs providing an incentive to use these pools? 

Yes the DEXs are providing an incentive to use provide liquidity to these pools. 

&gt;If so, how long can that last?

It depends on the tokenomics of the protocol, Raydium's distribution is over three years from launch. You can read more here about [Raydium Tokenomics](https://academy.moralis.io/blog/what-is-raydium-and-the-ray-token) and [Orca Tokenomics](https://learn.orca.so/token).

&gt;how these rates can be so high? 

Usually rates are high because they  want to distribute the majority of the tokens early to decentralize (so the devs aren't the ones holding all the power). and of course they would want to distribute power to members of the community and incentivise positive actions (liquidity providers, lenders, users). So, the earlier years of these DEXs will have high inflation. And you are incentivized to provide a service (LP, lending, staking, whatever), to beat inflation and receive this early distribution in the form of a token.

So the obvious question here is why would I want this inflationary (for now) token? The utility of these tokens is mainly governance, though there may be other uses depending on the protocol. If you think there is no long term potential for this DEX and its governance, you can sell the token for another token that you think has better value, SOL or UST or whatever. If you think that governance of these platforms holds a lot of value, you can hold these tokens for the future.

But the rest is still trading fees.

On Francium you can see the split between yield and trading fees.

However I would say the rule of thumb is when you see a 3 digit apy it’s either on a shitcoin or it’s just a short time thing.
For example the mSOL/USDC at 3x leverage on Francium (using Orca) was at 800% for a few days, and now gradually back to around 40% now. Still pretty good!

Thanks for replying back! Also a good question. I am pretty  
new to using Koinly so I am not fully confident on all it features, or at least my ability to use all of their features.   
Koinly has some features where when you sync your wallets with your account they can pull in all the new assets/transactions you have made since your last sync. I have some Aca and Astar now in my dot wallet that I received from the crowdloans but they do not show up when I resync my dot wallets. I am not sure if it is a Koinly thing or a Dot / Acala / AStar thing.  
I reached out to Koinly to ask how to account for these new tokens and they respond with this.
