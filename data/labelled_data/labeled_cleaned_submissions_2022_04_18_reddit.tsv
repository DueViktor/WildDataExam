Last week, more than 25,000 Bitcoin enthusiasts descended on Miami Beach for the biggest crypto asset's most lavish convention. They gathered to socialize, trade trading methods, learn about new technology, and mingle with the 'orange peels' worldwide. Danny Nelson of CoinDesk.com was on hand to document the event. 

During the four-day conference, the huge convention center in Miami Beach was a whirlwind of activity. Ticket Holders alternated between the crowded exhibition hall and four satellite stages, each with its personality and concept. For people in a hurry, needing to move from one far-flung destination to the next might be problematic. 

On the first day of the conference, Miami Mayor Francis X. Suarez presented a 3,000-pound charging bull monument in a not-so-subtle to convey the essence of a burgeoning innovation cluster. Unspoken: Miami Beach isn't his city; Mayor Dan Gelber is in charge. Despite this, Suarez's self-proclaimed Crypto.com booster character made him a sure thing for the ribbon-cutting, according to a local officer.

The 'Hodl' sneakers worn by Kraken Head of Growth Dan Held were just one item of Bitcoin regalia among many. Many web 3.0 fans were ecstatic to learn about invites like Point Network, consensys, and other rapidly progressing blockchain solutions.

The gathering was fed a continuous stream of pro-bitcoin rhetoric from MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor and ARK Investments CEO Cathie Wood.

2: It’s not possible to send bitcoin on the LN network to the BTC network directly

The market cap of “x” is $1000
There are 100 units, each unit is $10.

$1000 ÷ 100 = $10

Let’s say a new unit is added, i.e 101 units.

This in turn dilutes the price of each unit.

$1000 ÷ 101 ≈ $9.90

Now, if the price of each is not to be diluted - we want a stable price of $10 per unit - then $10 would need to be added to the market cap.

$1010 ÷ 101 = $10

Now let’s talk about Bitcoin,

If 900 new coins are mined, each day, for the price to be “stable”, let’s use 40k as example, then $36,000,000 needs to be added to the market cap, each day.

And for the price of Bitcoin to rise, in the example above, more than $36,000,000 needs to be added to the market cap. 

If the price reaches $100,000 per Bitcoin,  before the limit of coins mined is reached, do you think the amount of capital required to maintain a stable price is feasible/realistic?

Will we only see extreme highs once all coins are mined and the price per coin cannot be diluted by the addition of new coins? 

Are we at a point where the capital added to the market cannot maintain the price? 

With interest rates going up and I assume most people dumping their saving/stimulus cheques into Bitcoin already, are we at a turning point where the capital required to maintain the price is not enough? Hence the decrease in price from ATH."

Every chart and app, when i switch something like DOT/USD to DOT/BTC simply normalizes the entire graph by the current Bitcoin price.

Obviously that’s not what I’m looking for, that’s the same graph as the dollar graph.

What I’m looking for is a source that shows the actual, historical DOT/BTC exchange rate using the DOT and BTC price on THAT day in the past.

Again, all the sources ive found just compare the historical DOT price to today’s BTC price, which is useless.

A recovery phrase created by ledger will not work with a BitBox hardware wallet, will it?

Let's stick with streaming. The old days were uncomfortable, but they worked. They involved a lot of downloading, ads, subscriptions to strange sites (remember rapidshare?). But they worked. And they are still around in some ways. But then Netflix came around.

And Netflix was cool. Lots of stuff to watch, very convenient. Just worked. Fast forward to 2022. There are like 20 streaming services and the ones you have subscribed to rarely have the shows you actually want to watch. Nobody wants to install all their apps or give out all the data all the time.

But the future is already here, it's just not equally distributed yet. There is the tech to build streaming platforms for the masses that will get the legacy streaming providers innovating again.

We have Tor, we have Lightning. These two alone are powerful enough to build the streaming platform we need these days. One that connects uploaders and streamers. Where a 10 cent Lightning payment gives you access to the next episode of the show you want to watch, without subscriptions, ads, malware and other annoying shit. 

A marketplace for streaming links. You can see the ratings of the link and you can trust that it is actually what it says it is - because an ACTUAL HUMAN is paid to confirm. The links hosted send you to a dedicated uploading site. These service providers, whether on clearnet or darknet, provide the uploading site where the content providers upload any show humans ever made if there are any viewers to be found. 

The one stop shop for streaming. Everyone loves streaming. Anyone everywhere in the world with internet can work on a platform like this, providing content and getting paid for it. 

A technology to facilitate this that works well has the potential to reach hundreds of millions of people. Become the place that needs no advertisement because everyone knows about it and it's the natural go-to place whenever you are looking for that one movie.

A platform that lets the masses spend and earn Bitcoin. Where the average users put 50$ in their Lightning wallets every few months to have money readily available to stream instead of giving Netflix 20$ every month. Where people in the worst economies of the world can make a few hundred $ in Bitcoin every month by providing content.

The future is here my friends."	the real path to bitcoin mass adoption is in the old ways of the internet remember why you got on the internet in the first place it was probably because there was cool shit that would be hard expensive to get in other places conveniently for a lot of us it was streaming ebooks p0 rn let s stick with streaming the old days were uncomfortable but they worked they involved a lot of downloading ads subscriptions to strange sites remember rapidshare but they worked and they are still around in some ways but then netflix came around and netflix was cool lots of stuff to watch very convenient just worked fast forward to 2022 there are like 20 streaming services and the ones you have subscribed to rarely have the shows you actually want to watch nobody wants to install all their apps or give out all the data all the time but the future is already here it s just not equally distributed yet there is the tech to build streaming platforms for the masses that will get the legacy streaming providers innovating again we have tor we have lightning these two alone are powerful enough to build the streaming platform we need these days one that connects uploaders and streamers where a 10 cent lightning payment gives you access to the next episode of the show you want to watch without subscriptions ads malware and other annoying shit a marketplace for streaming links you can see the ratings of the link and you can trust that it is actually what it says it is because an actual human is paid to confirm the links hosted send you to a dedicated uploading site these service providers whether on clearnet or darknet provide the uploading site where the content providers upload any show humans ever made if there are any viewers to be found the one stop shop for streaming everyone loves streaming anyone everywhere in the world with internet can work on a platform like this providing content and getting paid for it a technology to facilitate this that works well has the potential to reach hundreds of millions of people become the place that needs no advertisement because everyone knows about it and it s the natural go to place whenever you are looking for that one movie a platform that lets the masses spend and earn bitcoin where the average users put 50 in their lightning wallets every few months to have money readily available to stream instead of giving netflix 20 every month where people in the worst economies of the world can make a few hundred in bitcoin every month by providing content who will start this platform who will start it for ebooks who will start it for audio who will start it for adult content the future is here my friends 	0.0023422352969646454	0.9886093139648438	0.0018135597929358482	0.01361452043056488	0.9941961765289307	0.9975565671920776	0.08004508912563324	8.409400038544845e-07	0.12997044622898102	0.015333731658756733

Coinjaf came at me accusing me of shilling shitcoin scams and threatened to ban me, then proceeded to belittle me for sharing a link on wallets that linked coinbase. Is this sort of abusive toxic maximalist behaviour conducive to growing a knowledgable and meaningful community?

Gemini has my ACH deposits and I am locked out due to 2FA issues (I changed my phone). The jury is still out from tech support as to whether I'll ever retrieve my fiat currency (fortunately, I offloaded my transaction key(s)  to a cold wallet) but I still have USD in my account.  Apparently, I violated their TOS because I do not have a U.S. phone number (I am in the Dom. Rep.) but the Gemini algorithm accepted my Dom. Rep. number in the first go-round and I used a VPN.  Now I need a U.S. number, I am told, but when I responded, I never heard back and I'm still waiting. 

While I'm still working on this problem, I see the writing on the wall. I must find a global or international exchange; however, when I Google same, although I do find many that claim to be such, when I am able to read the TOS, I find out that either you must be in the United States, and even within certain states and, for others, that you cannot be in the United States.

So I'm looking for any legitimate sites that are international in the sense that they do not require a particular home country. Any leads here?

I did read through a thread here pertaining to ""exchanges for U.S. expats"" but I could not find any solution there. Being in this grey area, where you have to use a VPN, makes it seem that you are trying to ""game the system"" when you run into a problem and need help from tech support. With respect to Gemini, clearly they have an internal problem--staff says that a U.S. number is mandatory but the website algorithm accepts a non-U.S. number, and I'm caught in the middle. 

I don't want to play these cat an mouse games where it's never clear if I am in violation . . ."

Thanks for your help!"	dumb noob question but necessary there s a new bitcoin atm near my house that you deposit fiat currency my usual buying method i on an exchange and when i have a significant amount i send it to ledger transfer fees are a little high l but i like controlling my private keys for obvious reasons my question is from a bitcoin atm it charges the exact amount from the blockchain as opposed to the exchange price but charges a 3 admin fee will there also be mining fees when it s transferred to my wallet common sense tells me i should just do it this way if that s the case thanks for your help 	0.002659790450707078	0.9891483187675476	0.009198264218866825	0.014051578938961029	0.00863524992018938	0.525538444519043	0.0807485431432724	8.26633822725853e-07	0.14236468076705933	0.00769461365416646

I did send this to modmail a couple days ago but didn't get a response and unfortunately this is an extremely time sensitive situation so I figured I had to just post it. I apologize if this isn't the type of content you want to see. I'm just at a loss for where to turn for help. Please check out the [Giveth](https://giveth.io/project/please-help-my-stranded-ukrainian-family) project I created.

Some quick background- my mother and grandparents on her side are in a terrible situation right now, stuck in the besieged city of Mariupol (in Ukraine).

I’ve been trying to raise funds in any way that I possibly can but I just haven’t had much luck. I unfortunately don’t have many “IRL” friends as I am an online student balancing gig work. All of the money I make, except for the absolute bare minimum that I need to survive, I have been sending to my family as soon as I get it - however it just isn’t enough.

For clarity sake I am a US citizen, I don’t intend to portray myself as personally being in Ukraine and firsthand witnessing the horrors unfolding alongside my family there.

In a way I wish I was there though because I just feel so helpless here. I worry for their lives literally every minute of every hour of every day. They have been stuck in their apartment in Mariupol since the beginning of the conflict and society collapses around them further everyday. The entire city is a hellscape. My grandfather is running dangerously low on his lifesaving medicine and they don’t have anywhere near enough money to buy safe passage out of the city and get the supplies and shelter they need.

At first I created a paypal fundraiser as I saw some people had luck with that however it was buried under thousands of others. I don’t really have anyone in person to share the link with so I must rely on kind folks willing to donate anything seeing it on their own. Unfortunately no one ever even saw it. At one point I desperately posted it with a summary of the situation in the [r/Ukraine](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ukraine) subreddit because I didn’t know what else to do but they are a bit jaded from scammers it seems (which is despicable and unfathomable to me right now that some people could be so callous and greedy).

From there I asked for advice in a discord for a crypto project where I have been involved in the community for awhile (Furucombo) and someone there suggested Giveth. I had a tiny bit of hope and immediately made an account/set up a fundraiser but unfortunately it seems like I'm dealing with the same problem where it’s buried under a lot of other projects.

I must ask this favor of you all now… if you have anything you could possibly give it would really mean the world to me. The project has already been approved/verified on Giveth but if there is any other proof you need please let me know and i’ll do my best to get whatever I can to you ASAP.

Here is the link to the fundraiser on Giveth again.

I truly believe in the overall goodness of humanity as a whole and especially the crypto community. If you guys could help me at least get some exposure to this fundraiser you have no idea how much it would mean to me. Get back to me if you need anything on my end please.

So many great apps go unnoticed by this community because someone will jump to a conclusion early and flag something as a scam.

Once something gets labeled as a scam, then the whole community assumes that the commenter knows what they are talking about.

On April 13, Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko confirmed on Twitter that the much-anticipated switch to proof-of-stake will not happen in June. Beiko estimates that the transition to the PoS consensus mechanism will take a few more months, and that no specific date can be given. He did, however, confirm that the company is nearing the end of the Proof-of-Work model.

Beiko's tweet comes just a few days after Ethereum's first mainnet Shadow fork went live on April 11, and the Ethereum Developers continue to work on converting Ethereum to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model. The move to Proof of Stake, in which users reserve the ability to secure the network by ""staking"" ether, is expected to cut Ethereum's energy costs by 99 percent and make scaling easier. This is the latest setback for a project that was supposed to be completed in 2019.

However, given the continued postponement of this move, I believe we should carefully consider our next major projects from a long-term perspective.

I hope it’s okay to ask this here, I never thought I’d need to ask something like this but here goes.

I had two NFT stamps that were originally minted on xDai, I just tried to bridge them to my Eth wallet, but ran out of gas fees and had to get some more Eth.

These two Txs are the last two made in relation to them.

So my wallet has definitely interacted with their smart contract, but I don’t know how to complete the Tx, or even if I can??

Any help given on figuring this out would be greatly appreciated!

Cheers."	question about transferring from xdai to eth hey there i hope it s okay to ask this here i never thought i d need to ask something like this but here goes i had two nft stamps that were originally minted on xdai i just tried to bridge them to my eth wallet but ran out of gas fees and had to get some more eth as i came back to complete the transactions the screen refreshed and i can no longer find them these two txs are the last two made in relation to them 1 0x98186de5dd1645989360f7f425fd63afa9351c15abf26d2ad1c24549e6e43b01 2 0xcadf906ca93904fe172315e06879e068b1344897e8c22b911740a126fc8e7c02 so my wallet has definitely interacted with their smart contract but i don t know how to complete the tx or even if i can any help given on figuring this out would be greatly appreciated cheers 	0.0030170700047165155	0.98909991979599	0.026226162910461426	0.012471433728933334	0.99396151304245	0.5328267812728882	0.15668992698192596	8.30427268283529e-07	0.16199743747711182	0.03580264747142792

Ethereum, a fuel for so many projects including NFTs and the Point Network, is undergoing a merging as a result of two key factors: the existing chain and a new one (relatively) 

""An attempt to convert from a proof-of-work model to proof-of-stake,"" according to Ethereum's merging. 

Ethereum is currently based on proof-of-work. Proof-of-work requires miners to solve difficult puzzles in order to validate financial transactions on the blockchain. 

The procedure necessitates a tremendous amount of energy, and some claim that it has a harmful influence on the environment.

Users will validate transactions based on the number of coins they contribute when the protocol is upgraded to proof-of-stake. 

All users have a higher chance of validating network transactions and earning more coins or incentives if they stake more coins. 

Ethereum uses both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake in tandem. Validators are available in both options. The Beacon chain, on the other hand, is exclusively processed by the proof-of-work chain. 

According to rumors, the merger will ""completely abolish mining."" 

The merger was a long-awaited undertaking. Many people were skeptical about the merger's success. Users continued to buy hardware to mine Ethereum due to a lack of awareness.

Mining equipment is quite costly. Miners require ""To build an Ether mining rig, you'll need computers, graphics cards, and other components. Miners invest a lot of money in equipment in the hopes that it will pay off in the long run."" 

The merger entails a considerable amount of risk. It is, however, a plan that has been approved for implementation. 

""It's a very high-stakes technological upgrade,"" said Matt Hougon, CIO of Bitwise Asset Management. ""There are risks it could be delayed or there could be issues in the implementation.""

While many people are skeptical, Ethereum engineers will complete the merging proof-of-stake.

""Ethereum has guaranteed proof of stake for five years, so there's a lot of mistrust,"" Beiko added. ""It's difficult to persuade folks that this time is different."""

 "	with the ethereum merger no longer expected in june i believe it is time to move on to more efficient projects the much anticipated switch to proof of stake according to ethereum core developer tim beiko may not happen until the fall the merge marks ethereum s transition to a proof of stake pos security mechanism the network currently uses a resource intensive proof of work pow system similar to bitcoin in which a decentralised network of computers competes to validate transactions the switch to pos in which users reserve the ability to secure the network by staking ether is expected to cut ethereum s energy costs by 99 percent and make scaling easier this is the latest in a long line of setbacks for a project that was supposed to be finished in 2019 however as this move continues to be postponed i believe we should examine our next major projects very carefully and with a long term perspective there are energy efficient coins like algorand fantom and new projects like bob eco coin on the market do you think we ll be able to successfully transition to pos this year i m currently considering adding some energy efficient projects to my portfolio 	0.0025317794643342495	0.9893233180046082	0.00619151396676898	0.9452885985374451	0.008015966042876244	0.3474442660808563	0.13889284431934357	8.575063361604407e-07	0.23236636817455292	0.007432505022734404
