I think the main selling point of eth is the number of dapps currently built on it and the amount of usage it currently has. Like how Apple can suck ass but because they have a lot of users and a lot of third party app developers there will never be a company that replaces them.

I think one benefit of making eth deflationary is that it paves the way for more investment in eth projects by the developers and community. It attracts more attention when the price goes up, which draws users, which motivates making eth dapps."	553e3b00a8fa838752df1558d1d2e657b35e04c5	True	False					0	1641052250		0.0	{}	hqtd1mp	False	t3_rtep7v	False	False	t1_hqt5l2c	/r/ethereum/comments/rtep7v/ethereum_eth_on_its_way_to_becoming_a/hqtd1mp/	1641052266.0	1.0	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0.0	[]		[]	text	t2_77ko62me	False	False	dyor and i m not an expert but i heard that most of the traffic on the ethereum network right now is for simple transactions that could should be moved to l2 which still uses eth indirectly the main net is still better for executing smart contracts i think the main selling point of eth is the number of dapps currently built on it and the amount of usage it currently has like how apple can suck ass but because they have a lot of users and a lot of third party app developers there will never be a company that replaces them i think one benefit of making eth deflationary is that it paves the way for more investment in eth projects by the developers and community it attracts more attention when the price goes up which draws users which motivates making eth dapps 	0.0007592349429614842	0.9954234957695007	0.36316847801208496	0.006989436689764261	0.004352880176156759	0.13752631843090057	0.11661536991596222	8.483984288432111e-07	0.33800750970840454	2.760668212431483e-05

So, if all the newly issued SOL goes to stakers, with a target inflation of 1.5%, the yield is 1.5 divided by fraction of staked SOL. So that means a 4-5% yield corresponds to 37.5-30% stake participation.

You might be right, but with liquid staking on the rise, I think staking participation will be much higher."	936b031320d7104fd678ca3b121da9a76acfd627	True	False					0	1641016609		0.0	{}	hqs02oy	False	t3_rswpit	False	True	t1_hqqkv6w	/r/solana/comments/rswpit/why_is_the_sol_staking_yield_going_down/hqs02oy/	1641016620.0	1.0	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0.0	[]		[]	text	t2_f2mjuxav	False	False	you re right thank you the 1 5 2 was from the documentation linked which assumes 90 60 initial stake participation should have made that more clear so if all the newly issued sol goes to stakers with a target inflation of 1 5 the yield is 1 5 divided by fraction of staked sol so that means a 4 5 yield corresponds to 37 5 30 stake participation you might be right but with liquid staking on the rise i think staking participation will be much higher 	0.0028022443875670433	0.9886345863342285	0.5156404376029968	0.945306122303009	0.008867993019521236	0.26926255226135254	0.08609799295663834	8.5405741856448e-07	0.41047337651252747	0.0037733749486505985

Right now there is a lot of misunderstanding of the value of pool tokens (they generally, if not universally, produce worse returns than vanilla SOL in defi systems) and I think the market will learn and adapt to this over time.

An efficient defi system transfers most of the benefits of staking SOL to participants even when unstaked SOL is used in the defi system - because the defi system itself just stakes the SOL behind the scenes anyway and can transmit most of the value back to the participant (to be competitive with other defi systems which would be doing the same thing)."	24d5e35a86e9cb0a8cc8439ba4090e48136100c2	True	False					0	1641079584		0.0	{}	hqv6614	False	t3_rswpit	False	False	t1_hqs02oy	/r/solana/comments/rswpit/why_is_the_sol_staking_yield_going_down/hqv6614/	1641079600.0	1.0	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0.0	[]		[]	text	t2_cqgpowc	False	False	i think that liquid staking has benefit only in convenience for not having to wait for warm up and cool down periods that is it right now there is a lot of misunderstanding of the value of pool tokens they generally if not universally produce worse returns than vanilla sol in defi systems and i think the market will learn and adapt to this over time an efficient defi system transfers most of the benefits of staking sol to participants even when unstaked sol is used in the defi system because the defi system itself just stakes the sol behind the scenes anyway and can transmit most of the value back to the participant to be competitive with other defi systems which would be doing the same thing 	0.0026666601188480854	0.9888926148414612	0.19180873036384583	0.0384909063577652	0.008678397163748741	0.5657137036323547	0.0633103996515274	8.329391789629881e-07	0.4674854874610901	0.029383495450019836
273	[]	False		FunEarnings						"\-**Do you think the flair labels are sufficient or could be improved?** Flair labels are fairly sufficient but would be good to have an ""Other"" label as the message on creating a new post says that flair is mandatory and sometimes the flair labels don't cover absolutely everything. A ""Question"" label and/or ""Help Wanted"" would also be good as many people post looking for resources or help. One other label I can think of is ""Trading"" but I don't want to see this subreddit turn into a mess of charts and outlandish price predictions.

\-**Do you think the welcome thread needs more info and what info? (Personally I think it does need better info, but I also don't know if people actually read it when they get here). The goal is to help get people the info they need and to reduce repeat question posts if possible.** Welcome thread should include [https://solana.com/ecosystem](https://solana.com/ecosystem) as the most prominent link. Additionally, it should have ways to get your hands on some Solana (exchanges, faucets, wallets, etc.). Furthermore, it would be good to link [https://solana.foundation/stake-pools](https://solana.foundation/stake-pools) as stake pools are important for decentralization. It may also be good to pin an FAQ to cover questions such as how to get Solana, how to use wallets, how to stake or use a stake pool, how certain concepts work (staking, stake pools, Solana PoS/PoH, etc.), addressing the FUD around downtime and countering centralization claims, etc.

**-Do you think a more filled out menu bar is better or more/certain info on sidebar? What info is missing from current menu? (I was adding some things Herr then sort of stopped at one point..)** I think that for the menus at the top, you may want to add a general resources page maybe with some links like [https://solana.com/ecosystem](https://solana.com/ecosystem) and [https://solana.foundation/stake-pools](https://solana.foundation/stake-pools) as well as anything else that might be helpful (exchanges, faucets, wallets, explorers, most helpful links from the welcome thread, etc.). Other than that, the layout for the subreddit seems fine.

**-On my wishlist is seeing the Solana Labs folks pop into the subreddit more often and also seeing more participation from established or up and coming projects in the ecosystem (barring NFT project promos lol).** I definitely agree. I know that I participate a lot on this subreddit as someone who runs and develops both established and up and coming projects ([https://solblaze.org/](https://solblaze.org/)) and I love it when I see other fellow developers and leaders in the ecosystem participating here. I know that most of the people at Solana Labs are fairly busy and don't really have the chance to post here, but it would be great if we have people from the Solana Labs team or other prominent organizations (Solana Foundation, Bonfida, FTX, etc.) come over once in a while to share updates and clarify questions. I definitely agree with the NFT promos, every day there are at least 3 new ""exciting drops"" posted here, and most posts with at least 10 upvotes have at least one comment (heavily downvoted of course) advertising the ""next big NFT drop"" and it's very frustrating, I wish there was a bit less of this spam and that the moderators could remove a lot of these posts that are just NFT promos (although I understand moderators are already so busy with running the subreddit in general that it's hard to catch all of these posts). Of course, there are some helpful (borderline-promotion) posts that are actually beneficial to the ecosystem and announce new dApps, DeFi protocols, or tools for the Solana ecosystem that people would find real value in using (I can say I make these kinds of posts all the time for SolBlaze regarding SOLFaucet, BlazeStake, etc.), those we should keep to help other users learn more about new projects, but most of the useless NFT posts should be removed for sure unless it's something like a prominent Solana organization or validator running an NFT sale for the purpose of donating to charity (like what Phantom did with their NFT sale for beta invites to the iOS Phantom app where the proceeds went to the Girls Who Code nonprofit, although that sale was very controversial) as long as those processes are carried out transparently.

I want to extend a huge thank you to the moderator team for r/solana and especially the new moderators of the subreddit (that I've seen around a lot in the recent months since you were made moderators), you all have been doing a great job maintaining this subreddit and have contributed to the success of the Solana ecosystem as a whole. I know there are a lot of ways to improve this subreddit, and 2022 will be a great year to make this community even better, but you have done such an amazing job already and have completely transformed this subreddit from a mess of spam posts, scams, and unrealistic moon-pumping posts to a friendlier environment that surfaces new projects and promotes education for this ecosystem to new users.

289	[]	False		CoinSteve						"In my opinion the liquid staking apps don't make things totally clear.  

&amp;#x200B;

When you ""stake"" on Marinade you're not really staking your SOL.  You're turning over your SOL to Marinade and receiving back an IOU in the form of mSOL tokens equivelent to the same amount of SOL + \~6.6% APY (realized as an increase in token value of mSOL vs SOL, calculated and compounded each epoch).   

In the very short term I believe your coins go into the Unstake liquidity pool which is used for ""immediate unstaking"" (for a small fee, pool is currently at 533,000 SOL).   

In theory Marinade leaves some coins in this liquidity pool but takes the majority of those deposited and spreads them across a very wide variety of validators helping the ecosystem since not all stake is going a small set of validators like when you stake with default settings in some wallets.  

Since to date Marinade has proven to be reputable and has attracted a rather large TVL or, rather,  total amount of coins staked, currently at 7.5 million SOL staked, the mSOL token has held its value and taken on a life of its own in the Solana defi space.   This adds additional utility to your SOL which would normally be locked up if staked normally.   It also can add additional risk if you use it as leverage and are subject to a sudden price change, or a an oracle error, or a bug in a smart contract, or some type of malicious attack which could lose to loss of the mSOL and therefore loss of the original SOL. 

If you need to immediately ""unstake"" from Marinade, sometimes its easier and possibly less costly to swap back to SOL via a DEX or aggregator such as [jup.ag](https://jup.ag).    In this case that is what you did it sounds like.    

If you just want to earn some extra APY on your mSOL you can take a look at various options on apps such as Port Finance, Francium, Tulip Garden (formally some other name), Solend, Mango Markets, and others which will pay some amount of APY on deposited mSOL.  

If you are trying to create some type of looping leverage effect you could deposit the mSOL into a lending/borrowing site such as Port Finance, Solend, etc, and then borrow SOL, mSOL or another asset against that.   Some apps will charge a flat fee on the borrow, some will charge more if you are borrowing the same asset you have deposited.   You can then take that borrowed asset and do whatever you want with it.  But the higher the utilization the higher the risk of liquidation in case something goes wrong. 

APYs on all of these apps fluctuate often and sometimes wildly as the utilization goes up and down and APY chasers move between sites causing changes in utilization and therefore APY and therefore utilization....  

You can also swap the mSOL for other tokens including stable coins  and do defi things with those, swapping back later if you want to get the orignal SOL back, and hopefully if pricing movements are in your favor. 

The mSOL can also be used in liquidity pools and other defi plays to earn or lose higher APYs.   Check Francium, Tulip Garden, Raydium, Orca for some more of these. 

Each option has a varying amount of extra risk attached vs just staking normally and keeping the coins in the wallet.   If 21 SOL is your whole bag it may be better to just stake at least half normally and forget about it for awhile.   Even on Solana with relatively cheap fees you will still pay or at least tie up quite a bit of SOL in network fees, rent fees (refundable in theory but can be significant), etc if you're moving stuff around a lot.

You cannot take advantage of parachain auctions with PolkaDOT and Kusama who pay out roughly 23%  in staking. Wouldn’t have gotten those MoonRiver tokens or Karura, or Bifrost or Shiden or MoonBeam and so on. With Cosmos and Osmosis you can liquid stake. Meaning you can participate in the LPs in Osmosis while also then staking those same assets for the regular APR% which is much higher than what you are showing. You also wouldn’t get the drops of ComDEX, Persistence, Shade Protocol, Hua Hua, BitSong, Desmos. The highly anticipated Sagan experimental chain. Can earn Secret while staking Luna also. Can’t take part in the SiennaDEX LPs there.
