Some users are developing a habit of asking if various random websites some complete stranger PM'd them is a scam or not. Sometimes these sites are completely unrelated to Bitcoin. This is not the purpose of r/Bitcoin.

* Do not trust unsolicited messages telling you to check out some shady website.
* Do not trust Discord randos telling you that you won a prize.
* Do not trust anyone who promises guaranteed profits.
* Do not trust website with unpronounceable domain names
* Do not trust anyone claiming to give away free Bitcoin. (YouTube, Twitter, Discord)
* Do not trust anyone claiming they will double however much Bitcoin you send them.
* Do not trust 'pretty girls' on Tinder telling you about new investment opportunities.
* **If you have to ask** if some sketchy website or special offer is a scam, **then it probably is.**

You have to learn to think for yourselves. Recognize that there are many tricksters out there who will go to great lengths to separate you from your Bitcoin. Use your head and stay safe. If you send your Bitcoin to a scammer, it's gone forever. There are no refunds!

Inequality isn't a problem that needs solving. Human beings are unequal. As for marginalization, Bitcoin may indeed help with that, as it will put more people on equal footing to participate in global markets.

&gt;BTC isn't going to solve Conflict.

Yes, it will, at least at the government/nation-state level. Governments can only afford to go to war if they can force their subjects to pay for it. Bitcoin is going to cripple governments' ability to confiscate wealth.

&gt;BTC isn't going to solve Malnutrition.

Yes, it will. Malnutrition is a symptom of inefficient markets.

&gt;BTC isn't going to solve Climate change.

Yes, it will. Greater prosperity translates into greater ability to care about the environment. It's like Maslow's hierarchy of needs. You can't care about your carbon footprint if you're just trying to survive.

&gt;BTC isn't going to solve Lack of Education.

Yes, it will. You can get all the education you need for free on the Internet, but you need broadband access to the Internet. Again, Bitcoin is the catalyst for people to pull themselves up into prosperity, which will bring them better connectivity to the trove of all human knowledge that is the Internet.

&gt;BTC isn't going to solve Man's Greed.

Greed is not a problem to be solved.

Shoot an email to our support team at support@exodus.com. They'll be able to figure out where your crypto went, if it's recoverable at all (possible if it went to a centralized exchange, but unlikely), and what we can do to take the scam down ourselves so this specific scam doesn't hurt more people.	873aa8f4ddf8f007b0c837f8b9d6500d735fdb5f	True	False					0	1648178440		0	{}	i20rk6r	False	t3_tnc8c5	False	True	t3_tnc8c5	/r/Bitcoin/comments/tnc8c5/need_help_scammed_from_my_exodus_wallet/i20rk6r/	1648178454	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_avjyrgxj	False	False

The actual effect on the price depends on who is doing the buying. The person doing the selling obviously wants to sell for as much money as they can get. So the effect depends on who is doing the buying, if it is to buy and hold then the supply decreases and the price slowly floats up. If, however, the person doing the buying wants to take out a large number of shorts and then dump all the bitcoin on the open market it can have a very sharp negative effect on the price.	4d095f6ac172b32411813c4b3f982055693df168	True	False					0	1648178370		0	{}	i20rf4s	False	t3_tn9p0f	False	True	t3_tn9p0f	/r/Bitcoin/comments/tn9p0f/how_will_bitcoins_price_go_up_if_large_trades_are/i20rf4s/	1648178382	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_kdf3g	False	False

Some L2s, though, use fraud proofs for transactions, which means that a transaction that steals users can be sent to the L1 instead of the transactions the user asked for, with the incentive not to send such transaction because any user can send a proof of fraud that is detrimental to the L2 validator (on top of ruining the business they had). 

And some L2s require some time between when you ask for retrieval and when you actually get your funds back. This is probably why you had some sense of a time period being needed. But that is if you don't directly interact with the smart contract, which would be the case if the validator is down. 

But that's not the case of ZK Rollups: they don't use fraud proof, they use proof of valid transactions, so that it's not possible to add any transaction the user didn't request."	22a961faf64d644c7500009239e9466aca4b5da0	True	False					0	1648178176		0	{}	i20r0ug	False	t3_tm9vgv	False	True	t1_i20ozb4	/r/ethereum/comments/tm9vgv/yesterday_arbitrum_sequencer_was_the_top_spender/i20r0ug/	1648178188	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_13pqgo	False	False
