There is a shitload more competition these days and way too many really bad names that bring down average sales and make finding a good name on opensea hard for people who are browsing (your less likely to sell) buy your names for multiple years if you can afford it and be prepared to be patient.

You're right tokenomics shouldn't be as important. But it's a decentralized ecosystem: people will talk about whatever they want. And since ETH needs to have its price discovered, change in the tokenomics need to be discussed to be priced in.

Regarding SBTs, I guess people don't know enough yet about it to have any opinion. Personally, that's my case. It could be as wonderful as it could be disastrous, because it deals with data that need privacy and that need to be protected from hacks: for instance, having people being able to take your diploma and ID cards and send them to any administration to pretend they're you is a sure way to hurt many people. It could be done right, but it would require such a huge coordination from so many actors I'm not yet seeing how. The definition of the SBT itself isn't enough. 

Besides, there's again no reason for ETH not to be an investment too or a liquidity for. There's nothing preventing any asset to have more than one role. Just like your fiat can buy you some restaurant meal as well as being a hedge against volatility when it's well handled.

The EIP-1559 got a lot of traction and was considered something game changing for Ethereum. Yes, it improved the tokenomics to increase value on the chain but why did not zk developments or the soul bound NFTs or funding protocols gain enough traction to be talked about. Most people that own ETH have not used the chain, not even once. ETH's economic adjustments are vital for development of the network but talking about what happens on the network is necessary. In the case of bitcoin, you talk about the increase in value of time as it is supposed to act as an inflation hedge and preserve purchasing power. The narrative is different in the case of Ethereum that should be understood	faa81b7e917160f1d2ba7ddacac7337f446ee6c8	True	False					0	1654834442		0	{}	ibtg7hg	True	t3_v89cnr	False	True	t1_ibtb64t	/r/ethereum/comments/v89cnr/money_talks_why_not_ethereum/ibtg7hg/	1654834459	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

Your first paragraph makes it seem like a no strings attached life hack, but buried a few paragraphs later there are some really important caveats, like how you need to pay for everything up front yourself, are expected to produce a significant amount of work, and only get paid if you can demonstrate that contributed significantly. Crypto hackathons and scholorships are great, but they also pay way under-market, and are often pretty exploitative of participants.

Generally, if you can do well enough to get a scholarship, or be competitive at a hackathon, you could also just get a job in the space that's going to pay way more than the cost of some conference travel.

I've got to say though, ETH Global hackathons are fun as hell, and I kind of do wish I was still at a point in my life where I could just be a Hachathon Hobo, drifting around the world doing hackathons like many of the people I've hung out with at ETH Global events."	424058bf0e13a9f564a9acf879f4aa947bdcb88b	True	False					0	1654874830		0	{}	ibv5zhx	False	t3_v9557l	False	True	t1_ibv0126	/r/ethereum/comments/v9557l/how_to_attend_ethereum_conferences_for_free/ibv5zhx/	1654874846	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

I thought having such an opening would make it more enticing to the reader and make them more likely to read more. I genuinely don't know which one is better because I know that some people like a more poetic opening.

\&gt; The way the introduction to this post is written sounds just like one of those 30 minute TV infomercials on how to succeed in real estate investing

&amp;#x200B;

This is fair criticism. However, the key difference is that unlike a real estate investing infomercial, almost all of the things I mention here are free and you can follow most of the advice here without me gaining anything financially. For example, if you use Twitter to search for a scholarship using the method I get and you win a $1,000 scholarship and a free flight and hotel to ETHCC in Paris, I don't make any money from that and it was completely free for you.

You pay one time for the domain (NFT).  The only additional fees are gas fees if you want to make a change to the where it points or what it contains.

For example:

$40 fee to mint ""myname.crypto"". You can use that domain as my payment address in many web3 compatible wallets.  If you enter it into a browser, it takes you to my website, or any other content I want to display.  You can enter multiple coin addresses under one domain and the system automatically determines which of your wallets should receive the sent coins.

So you could send Monero to my UD name, and it will go to my monero address listed in the domain.  You could also send ETH to that same address and it will go to my ETH wallet, or LTC, or etc...

I think it's the better system for Web3 and Crypto payments all in one, but at the end of the day the whole UD ecosystem is an Eth Smart Contract so you have to rely on ETH."	5604430bf04ef445e59531f8367e9fe98733db65	True	False					0	1654871948		0	{}	ibuz6i2	False	t3_v8vfp0	False	True	t3_v8vfp0	/r/ethereum/comments/v8vfp0/ens_domains_what_i_have_learned_so_far_and/ibuz6i2/	1654871967	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

""Since the ENS contracts only deal with hashes, they have no direct way to enforce limits on what can be registered; character length restrictions are implemented by allowing users to challenge a short name by providing its preimage to prove it‚Äôs too short.  
This means that you can in theory register both ‚Äòfoo.eth‚Äô and ‚ÄòFOO.eth‚Äô, or even &lt;picture of my cat&gt;.eth.

Dapps that assist users with registering names should prevent users from registering unresolvable names by using nameprep to preprocess names being requested for registration."""	2afb3cf7e4d086aa9ff4e1d683e86a0c428bd1a1	True	False					0	1654862620		0	{}	ibugjsx	False	t3_v8vfp0	False	True	t1_ibug4ks	/r/ethereum/comments/v8vfp0/ens_domains_what_i_have_learned_so_far_and/ibugjsx/	1654862632	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]
