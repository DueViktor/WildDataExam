You're right tokenomics shouldn't be as important. But it's a decentralized ecosystem: people will talk about whatever they want. And since ETH needs to have its price discovered, change in the tokenomics need to be discussed to be priced in.

Regarding SBTs, I guess people don't know enough yet about it to have any opinion. Personally, that's my case. It could be as wonderful as it could be disastrous, because it deals with data that need privacy and that need to be protected from hacks: for instance, having people being able to take your diploma and ID cards and send them to any administration to pretend they're you is a sure way to hurt many people. It could be done right, but it would require such a huge coordination from so many actors I'm not yet seeing how. The definition of the SBT itself isn't enough. 

Besides, there's again no reason for ETH not to be an investment too or a liquidity for. There's nothing preventing any asset to have more than one role.

The EIP-1559 got a lot of traction and was considered something game changing for Ethereum. Yes, it improved the tokenomics to increase value on the chain but why did not zk developments or the soul bound NFTs or funding protocols gain enough traction to be talked about. Most people that own ETH have not used the chain, not even once. ETH's economic adjustments are vital for development of the network but talking about what happens on the network is necessary.

Your first paragraph makes it seem like a no strings attached life hack, but buried a few paragraphs later there are some really important caveats, like how you need to pay for everything up front yourself, are expected to produce a significant amount of work, and only get paid if you can demonstrate that contributed significantly. Crypto hackathons and scholorships are great, but they also pay way under-market, and are often pretty exploitative of participants.

Generally, if you can do well enough to get a scholarship, or be competitive at a hackathon, you could also just get a job in the space that's going to pay way more than the cost of some conference travel.

I've got to say though, ETH Global hackathons are fun as hell, and I kind of do wish I was still at a point in my life where I could just be a Hachathon Hobo, drifting around the world doing hackathons like many of the people I've hung out with at ETH Global events."	424058bf0e13a9f564a9acf879f4aa947bdcb88b	True	False					0	1654874830		0	{}	ibv5zhx	False	t3_v9557l	False	True	t1_ibv0126	/r/ethereum/comments/v9557l/how_to_attend_ethereum_conferences_for_free/ibv5zhx/	1654874846	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]			there s a common phrase there s no such thing as a free lunch your first paragraph makes it seem like a no strings attached life hack but buried a few paragraphs later there are some really important caveats like how you need to pay for everything up front yourself are expected to produce a significant amount of work and only get paid if you can demonstrate that contributed significantly crypto hackathons and scholorships are great but they also pay way under market and are often pretty exploitative of participants generally if you can do well enough to get a scholarship or be competitive at a hackathon you could also just get a job in the space that s going to pay way more than the cost of some conference travel i ve got to say though eth global hackathons are fun as hell and i kind of do wish i was still at a point in my life where i could just be a hachathon hobo drifting around the world doing hackathons like many of the people i ve hung out with at eth global events 	0.0024969475343823433	0.9884468913078308	0.5954755544662476	0.0165629293769598	0.9942672848701477	0.9968947172164917	0.10490511357784271	8.53399512834585e-07	0.314493328332901	0.006125991232693195

You pay one time for the domain (NFT).  The only additional fees are gas fees if you want to make a change to the where it points or what it contains.

For example:

$40 fee to mint ""myname.crypto"". You can use that domain as my payment address in many web3 compatible wallets.  If you enter it into a browser, it takes you to my website, or any other content I want to display.  You can enter multiple coin addresses under one domain and the system automatically determines which of your wallets should receive the sent coins.

So you could send Monero to my UD name, and it will go to my monero address listed in the domain.  You could also send ETH to that same address and it will go to my ETH wallet, or LTC, or etc...
