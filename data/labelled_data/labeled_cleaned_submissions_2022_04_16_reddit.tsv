While we have seen reserve banks issue their own versions of cryptocurrencies, many still see them as a threat to financial stability and their ability to regulate. I know very little about blockchains and their utility to society, but this thought crossed my mind while studying for my upcoming CFA exam. I stumbled on the 51% attack vulnerability in the Fintech section which basically says that if a user or group of miners control more than 50% of the network's hash rate (computer power), they would be able to dictate future changes on the ledger/blockchain. 

So I did an oversimplified version of how much it would cost to do such a thing. To simplify things a little I removed salaries, facilities and other operational expenses. I simply worked out how many Antminer S19 mining rigs you would need to purchase to have the necessary hash rate to perform a 51% attach on Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin network hash rate = 194.49M TH/s

Antminer S19 = 110 TH/s Cost = $13 600 per unit

Units needed = 194 490 000/110 = 1 768 091

Total Cost of mining rigs = $24,05 Billion

Electricity cost per day = 3.25kW/h \* $0.0751 (Louisiana cost) \* 24 \* 1768091 = $10.4 Million a day

Annual cost of electricity = $3.8 Billion

**Total cost of a 1-year project = $27.85 Billion**

So it's extremely expensive to perform this kind of operation for any given individual but from the perspective of the world's largest financial institutions and governments, this is relatively inexpensive if they deem cryptocurrency a threat. For example, China has imposed many restrictions in the past and currently has a complete ban on all cryptocurrency transactions, China's central bank could quite easily finance such an operation if it feels that its ban is being ignored. In this scenario, once the users of Bitcoin realise that a single entity has control of the network with no clear end in sight, it will likely lose its user's trust and therefore its value. Bitcoin is roughly 40% of the total market cap of cryptocurrencies and if it was victim to such an attack, I think it is likely that the overall market sentiment toward cryptocurrencies, in general, would be extremely negative. I'm not quite sure how an issue like this would ever be resolved if it occurred, proof of stake protocols might prevent this from ever happening but they come with many problems.

Learning about this vulnerability made me seriously question how secure I deemed cryptocurrencies to be. I know I've ignored a lot of the costs associated with running such a project and the supply issues with trying to buy such a large number of mining rigs, not to mention their expected increase in price if someone attempted to do so. It's just crazy to me that 1-year project with a cost of approximately 3.67% of Bitcoin's market cap could potentially strip the asset of almost all of its value and cause major panic within the entire asset class. I mean the yearly net income of JP Morgan exceeds this amount (so if Mr Dimon ever feels threatened... he knows what to do lol ). The crazy thing is there is a lot of grey area when considering the legality of it, there isn't really any regulation on it and technically if you own most of the computing power, who's to say you shouldn't be able to do what you want with it?

I know this is very unlikely to actually happen and I'm probably missing a whole load of factors that make this way harder to pull off from a technological standpoint and financial standpoint. This was pretty much just an excuse for me to procrastinate on my studies for a little bit. I'd really appreciate any feedback from those of you with some insights into the technical issues with this scenario as well as other issues."

So few months back I decided to run a full node on my (very capable) home pc running windows.

Maybe I am too tired or just retarded, but I have been thining about this all day and need help..

&amp;#x200B;

I tried mining today with my GTX 1080. I will earn about 1$ in 24 hours and likely spend a lot more on electricity, but this is a test run, so who cares. The program tells me that I run at around 20 MH/s. Other websites tell me that I am likely to get up to 35 MH/s mining sh!tco!ns.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the mining hardware market, I see some quite outrageous prices. BUT, the expensive ones run at 100 TH/s, and a few even higher. 100 TH/s is a lot: 

&amp;#x200B;

100 TH/s is 5.000.000 times more hashes per second than my gtx 1080. But it is pretty obvious that I won't mine the equivalent of $ 5.000.000 per day... 

So what's wrong with my calculations ? Is my logic completely f\*\*\*ed?

&amp;#x200B;

100.000.000.000.000 (TH/s) / 20.000.000 (TH/S) = 5.000.000

That's it. Simplicity is a fundamental security practice. I don't agree with the complexity of multisig, Shamir Secrets, 3rd party signers, etc.

As an aside: Written and stamped seeds create attack vectors. Your seed should be memorized and backed up on a hard wallet. If you have a brain injury, you can recover everything, because your loved ones have a PIN, which differs from yours, but opens the same wallet. Memorization is the coldest act of self-sovereignty there is, because you bond the seed to your person as language. It means that no law enforcement agency, flood, fire, tornado, jealous ex, or lucky metal detector can separate you from your bitcoin by getting your written/stamped seed. 90% of the lost bitcoin wouldn't be lost if people had simply memorized their seed. If you also don't stamp or write your seed, you effectively eliminate every loss vector. There are hacks, but the risk here should be zero, because your seed should never touch an internet connection or internet connected device, because you should be using PSBTs.

As long as we are only engaged and not married, for a state office we aren't family so my fiancee can't just give me this money without paying tax (3-20% i'm not sure how exactly this range is determined).

And as a cryptocurrency user I questioned myself - is there a chance to avoid paying this tax by exchanging this money to BTC on stock market and then Just sending wire transfer to my BTC wallet? 

I guess I will have to sell for cash If i would like to avoid a tax office in 100% but for now I'm curious If this approach has even a chance to fullfilment my purpose.

PS: I live in Poland so If somebody who live there too know only the answer about tax amount in this scenario, I would be really grateful too.

As long as we are only engaged and not married, for a state office we aren't family so my fiancee can't just give me this money without paying tax (3-20% i'm not sure how exactly this range is determined).

And as a cryptocurrency user I questioned myself - is there a chance to avoid paying this tax by exchanging this money to BTC on stock market and then Just sending wire transfer to my BTC wallet? 

I guess I will have to sell for cash If i would like to avoid a tax office in 100% but for now I'm curious If this approach has even a chance to fullfilment my purpose.

PS: I live in Poland so If somebody who live there too know only the answer about tax amount in this scenario, I would be really grateful too.

May the HODL be with you :p"

**Long version**

**The story:**  
My family’s business is making nameplates and other metal products for heavy industry like mining equipment, wind farms, train engines etc. We have quite a bit of experience in making heavy-duty plates with durable markings that have to survive harsh conditions and disasters for evidence reasons.

I’m also a cryptocurrency enthusiast and I’ve seen that the most popular seed phrase backups are quite flimsy and expensive at the same time. This is why I have thought about making something more durable, at the same price or cheaper. I also wanted to bundle everything you need in the box, so you could start right away with making your backup.

I’ve spent the past few months making the website and perfecting the manufacturing process. In the meantime, I got some customers that enjoyed the product (some of them were probably fellow Redditors - thank you!) so I expanded the delivery option from Europe to worldwide.  In the coming days, I will also update the website with new photos, how-to and stress videos. Wanted to spread the word a bit here, looking also for feedback and suggestions.

**About the products:**  
All Coinplate backups are 100% made of Stainless Steel (1.4301 | AISI 304) which guarantees that they’re water, rust and corrosion resistant. It is also fireproof up to temperatures around 1.300°C/2.400°F (even up to 1.450°C/2.650°F), while house fires reach up to 850°C/1.500°F.  My private stress tests show that it can take a lot of beating. I’ll also publish some stress tests videos in the coming days/weeks. I’ll try to ask Jameson Lopp to perform his own stress tests as well.

Coinplate crypto wallets are made of 2 very thick stainless steel plates joined with stainless bolts. Each steel plate is 3/16"" | 5mm thick, forming together a thick steel sandwich to protect your seed phrase. Bolts are also AISI 304 Stainless Steel and are 3/16”| 5mm in diameter. The layout and lettering are deep engraved in steel. These features guarantee seed phrase visibility even after the worst accidents or disasters.

You can store 24 words on each Coinplate with BIP39 seed phrase (mnemonic), so it's either one 24-word-long seed phrase or two 12-word-long. With Coinplate Punch you also have some extra space for additional information. Because Coinplate ALPHA and GRID have a full A-Z layout, you can use them also for a passphrase. If your passphrase has also numbers, you might want to use Coinplate PUNCH for that.

All Coinplate are designed to be easy to store and hide. This is why they have a flat design and no permanent branding. You can easily remove all the branding and logos (it's just a sticker) so it would look just like a steel slab. This way it's much easier to overlook and harder to make sense of what it is when found by someone else.

Also, there are extra mounting holes in all Coinplate steel backups so you can fix or hang it anywhere you want. Inside a wardrobe or cabinet, behind drywall or under the floor - you name it. You even get the wood screws included with the set.

This kind of build and materials make it possible to store your seed phrase for literally decades. You can literally bury it in your yard if you wish.

Coinplate steel wallets are almost 3 pounds (2.8lb | 1.3kg), making them quite solid. Coinplate backups are exceeding standards for mining rigs nameplates by a big margin, and these have to survive explosions and mine-shaft collapse for evidence.

All of this might be a bit too much for everyday situations, but I like to be sure that my seed phrase is secure, and I wanted for others to feel safe too.

**There are 3 products available at the moment:**

1.   **Coinplate ALPHA - $79 – Easiest to use.**  Two engraved steel plates with separate spacing for each letter. Marking with an automatic center punch. Capacity of 24 words  
Included in the box: Automatic center punch, marker pen, torx wrench, tamper-proof stickers, wood screws.

2.   **Coinplate GRID - $69 – More affordable choice.**  Two engraved steel plates with a table.  Marking with an automatic center punch. Capacity of 24 words  
Included in the box: Automatic center punch, marker pen, torx wrench, tamper-proof stickers, wood screws.

3.   **Coinplate PUNCH - $65 – Punch / engrave your seed.** Two plates with engraved spacing for words. Mark your seed phrase with letter punch stamps and hammer or use electric engraver. Capacity of 24 words + 4 extra spaces.  
Included in the box: marker pen, torx wrench, tamper-proof stickers, marker pen, wood screws. Set of letter and number stamps available for extra $15, electric engraver available for extra $20.

Three and five pieces Value Packs are available - save up to 30%.  
Free worldwide shipping with orders from 100$.

Everything is made in-house, so personalization is possible if you would like so.

I'm at the beginning of this project and hope to run it further, improving the offer and introducing some of my ideas to new products.

**If you have questions, feel free to ask here.**  
**Any feedback, criticism or just discussion is also welcome :)**

You can also take a look at FAQ section at my website, use a chat there or e-mail me.

In my most recent YouTube video, I took a look at everything there is to know about Bitcoin fundamentally! I have done a video on how Bitcoin is the best money we have ever seen on this planet; however, this video is my deep dive to help understand nearly everything you can know about Bitcoin. I go into details, including blockchains and hashing, asymmetric encryption, Mining and proof of work, halving and how it drives the investing cycle, and more! I hope this helps people get started in the cryptocurrency space! If you are already very well-read on the space, a little refresher may be helpful :)

Hello Wonderful Bitcoin Community!

In my most recent YouTube video, I took a look at everything there is to know about Bitcoin fundamentally! I have done a video on how Bitcoin is the best money we have ever seen on this planet; however, this video is my deep dive to help understand nearly everything you can know about Bitcoin. I go into details, including blockchains and hashing, asymmetric encryption, Mining and proof of work, halving and how it drives the investing cycle, and more! I hope this helps people get started in the cryptocurrency space! If you are already very well-read on the space, a little refresher may be helpful :)

Link to the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIGEbjIJ1Xc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIGEbjIJ1Xc)

If you enjoyed the video or learned something new that you did not know before, please drop a like and subscribe :)

Have a wonderful day, everybody

This may well be a di*k question but if someone could explain it to me, please:

Suppose you invest your fiat into crypto, such as BTC. Then you make gains. Then you withdraw your funds into your fiat account. 

In the above scenario you need to pay tax on the gains, that I know. 

Now, suppose you do the same but you do not withdraw your funds into your fiat based account... And you find ways to pay for whatever it is you want to purchase online or in store, using crypto, do you still need to pay tax on the above mentioned gains?

I hope this makes sense.

I have already purchased the general access ticket and I am planning to upgrade to industry pass and I was wondering if at the end its worth it for a person in my age to attend this type of event. Like three are a lot of people being salty and telling that the conference is super cringe and the sound festival only was worth it. My other concern is , will I be able to meet and network with people in my age, because (no hate) only older people are attending from what I have seen in social this and the last year. I am also interested to join the external activities during the next bitcoin week like afterparties , other small conferences etc etc. So is it worth it for my age? Will I meet new people easily ?

Claims that will earn the raising of eyebrows, but fail to address the fundamental question is the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining is worth the benefits? This question should be broken down into two aspects: energy consumption and hardware churn.

The energy used by Bitcoin miners does three powerful things:

**Energy consumption**

1.Secures all the wealth stored on the Bitcoin network in a decentralized state.

Most current financial systems are controlled by a centralized entity, banks, credit unions, federal reserve, etc. This means that those central parties can manipulate funds, stop transactions or do whatever they feel is in the “best interest” of whatever source of power is pushing them to act. For example, Canada recently confiscated funds that were donated to a protesting group they did not agree with. Banks, credit unions, GoFundMe, and many other entities were asked to freeze accounts, stop payments or take action in some way to prevent funding the protesters. Because Bitcoin has no single point of control, flexing this level of power is not possible whether you’re an individual or a sovereign nation.

2.Creates a financial incentive that promotes renewable energy sources

Bitcoin mining has become a profitable industry for many companies. One major expense mining companies face is energy costs. What is the cheapest energy long-term? You guessed it, renewables. There is a built-in financial incentive to acquire the cheapest energy for these “for-profit” companies which means every mining company will seek out integrating renewable energies as part of their operational setup. With greater demand for renewables, renewable companies will allocate more funds for research and development to improve wind, solar, and hydro technologies to better fulfill the added market demand. Coming full circle, Bitcoin mining is not only promoting the adoption but also the improvement of renewable energy technology.

3.Provides stability to unstable power grids

An interesting aspect of Bitcoin mining is the ability for miners to be turned on or off ad hoc without affecting operational infrastructure, unlike cement, steel, or any other industrial entity. Because of this, we are seeing grid operators partnering with mining facilities to best make use of the energy grids. In Texas, there was a recent overload on the power grid when a freeze came through and every household had to turn off their heater. With the amount of energy needed to sustain every business and household, the energy grid was at a near collapse and rolling blackouts were pushed to keep the grid intact. Since the freeze, the grid has been expanding with added renewables and with miners leveraging much of the “excess” or unused energy. In the event of another freeze where the household energy consumption is expected to spike, the energy companies would pay the mining companies to turn off a portion of their Bitcoin miners to free up the needed energy supply to the grid. Once the household load subsides, the Bitcoin miners can be turned back on utilizing the freed-up “excess” energy.

**Hardware Churn**

The physical lifespan of a current ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miner is between 2-3 years. Financial lifespan will have a broader range depending on multiple factors such as cost of energy usage, when the miner comes online, the hash rate growth of the network, and what the Bitcoin price does during the miner’s lifespan. 

Another factor that’s had a significant impact on mining is the rate at which hardware technology has evolved, specifically for ASIC miners. As soon as a new miner is released, there is a stronger and more efficient miner right around the corner. This has led to a lot of churn with large-scale mining operations quickly retiring old miners and replacing them with new ones.

Given that Bitcoin mining is still relatively new, especially from a commercialization view, mining technology is evolving at a rapid rate which means if you are in the business of mining for profit, you’ll likely continue purchasing the new mining rigs to keep your financial returns competitive with your peers. This leaves many “older” mining rigs in a position of no man’s land where they can’t return profits worth their operational costs and they can’t be re-purposed for any other use.

I believe this is the most valid critique of Bitcoin mining but one that can hopefully be addressed in the near future. There have been a few ideas floating around, such as integrating retired miners with new home energy builds to help offset energy costs while maintaining the Bitcoin network or building miners in a way where once they are decommissioned, they can be better stripped to have their components re-purposed. Either way, hardware churn is a top concern of the Bitcoin community and is likely to be addressed as more hardware manufacturers enter the space.

**In Summary**

*Bitcoin mining is a waste of energy*

This critique is COMPLICATED - On one hand, the energy Bitcoin consumes is used to secure all of the stored wealth in a decentralized state, provides stability to power grids, and promote renewable energy development and implementation. On the other hand, the physical miners are often replaced frequently with no real repurposable utility for the retired miners."

You’ve probably heard claims like “Bitcoin mining consumes more energy than all of Argentina” or “Bitcoin mining uses more energy than all of Google operations”. Claims that will earn the raising of eyebrows, but fail to address the fundamental question is the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining is worth the benefits? This question should be broken down into two aspects: energy consumption and hardware churn.

The energy used by Bitcoin miners does three powerful things:

**Energy consumption**

1.Secures all the wealth stored on the Bitcoin network in a decentralized state.

Most current financial systems are controlled by a centralized entity, banks, credit unions, federal reserve, etc. This means that those central parties can manipulate funds, stop transactions or do whatever they feel is in the “best interest” of whatever source of power is pushing them to act. For example, Canada recently confiscated funds that were donated to a protesting group they did not agree with. Banks, credit unions, GoFundMe, and many other entities were asked to freeze accounts, stop payments or take action in some way to prevent funding the protesters. Because Bitcoin has no single point of control, flexing this level of power is not possible whether you’re an individual or a sovereign nation.

2.Creates a financial incentive that promotes renewable energy sources

Bitcoin mining has become a profitable industry for many companies. One major expense mining companies face is energy costs. What is the cheapest energy long-term? You guessed it, renewables. There is a built-in financial incentive to acquire the cheapest energy for these “for-profit” companies which means every mining company will seek out integrating renewable energies as part of their operational setup. With greater demand for renewables, renewable companies will allocate more funds for research and development to improve wind, solar, and hydro technologies to better fulfill the added market demand. Coming full circle, Bitcoin mining is not only promoting the adoption but also the improvement of renewable energy technology.

3.Provides stability to unstable power grids

An interesting aspect of Bitcoin mining is the ability for miners to be turned on or off ad hoc without affecting operational infrastructure, unlike cement, steel, or any other industrial entity. Because of this, we are seeing grid operators partnering with mining facilities to best make use of the energy grids. In Texas, there was a recent overload on the power grid when a freeze came through and every household had to turn off their heater. With the amount of energy needed to sustain every business and household, the energy grid was at a near collapse and rolling blackouts were pushed to keep the grid intact. Since the freeze, the grid has been expanding with added renewables and with miners leveraging much of the “excess” or unused energy. In the event of another freeze where the household energy consumption is expected to spike, the energy companies would pay the mining companies to turn off a portion of their Bitcoin miners to free up the needed energy supply to the grid. Once the household load subsides, the Bitcoin miners can be turned back on utilizing the freed-up “excess” energy.

**Hardware Churn**

The physical lifespan of a current ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miner is between 2-3 years. Financial lifespan will have a broader range depending on multiple factors such as cost of energy usage, when the miner comes online, the hash rate growth of the network, and what the Bitcoin price does during the miner’s lifespan. 

Another factor that’s had a significant impact on mining is the rate at which hardware technology has evolved, specifically for ASIC miners. As soon as a new miner is released, there is a stronger and more efficient miner right around the corner. This has led to a lot of churn with large-scale mining operations quickly retiring old miners and replacing them with new ones.

Given that Bitcoin mining is still relatively new, especially from a commercialization view, mining technology is evolving at a rapid rate which means if you are in the business of mining for profit, you’ll likely continue purchasing the new mining rigs to keep your financial returns competitive with your peers. This leaves many “older” mining rigs in a position of no man’s land where they can’t return profits worth their operational costs and they can’t be re-purposed for any other use.

I believe this is the most valid critique of Bitcoin mining but one that can hopefully be addressed in the near future.
