Let me part with this dispute for now. If I invested in real estate, buying a 1st property in May, and a 2nd house in Decemeber, then I should be allowed to sell my 2nd property without being told I must sell the 1st property beforehand for FIFO's sake.

If I later buy a 3rd home and subsequently sell my 1st place, I wouldn't be lectured that I can't toggle between FIFO and FILO. Anyone would respect my prerogative to sell my bought properties in whatever order I choose as long as the cost basis and sale price of each are observed accurately.

The risks I mentioned are protocol and smart contract risks: orca can be hacked or exploited, marinade can suffer hacks or be exploited also, mSOL can lose its peg in convoluted market situations (although I don't really think it would lose its peg for more than 2-3 days), and might be others.				1645097762	{}	hxao70e	False	t3_sumlh5	False	True	t3_sumlh5	/r/solana/comments/sumlh5/is_this_a_good_staking_strategy_or_what_could_be/hxao70e/	1648944221.0	1	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n		0	[]

Thank you so much for your long reply.

\-The Tax thing: I did my research and crypto is very weird when it comes to taxes. My understanding so far: Germany treats crypto pretty much like a Watch, Sneakers or Art that increase in value over time. Holding this type of investment for a year makes it tax free. Using this to gain money by lending it changes it's tax status. At the very moment I decide to stake my coins and click on the staking button, I have to expect to pay full 45% tax on both coins and staking rewards. It becomes both tax free 10 years after I initially bought the coins. 

\-The mSOL thing: It sounds good (even though the chart looks just like a ponzi scheme) but it just adds another party that I see as a risk factor besides me not knowing anything about neither mSOL, marinade finance, the validators or the technical ongoing behind staking. I read through the marinade info sheet and it just gives me off ponzi/pyramide scheme vibes ([https://docs.marinade.finance/marinade-dao/contributors#work-groups-details](https://docs.marinade.finance/marinade-dao/contributors#work-groups-details)). 

Maybe I got some things wrong but I don't really see the point of staking mSol over SOL.

I still hope that marinade is legit and I will follow their path and watch out if there is an oppurtunity for me to use it.

376	[]		R0Y-BATTY			[]				text	t2_1y83l9zq	False	False	[]	Personally I look at Solana and see a network/technology that is currently in use - much of the NFT market uses Solana instead of ETH due to the fees, I don't know much about avalanche so my takeaway is that wether you like them or hate them NFT's seem to be selling well and the fact that the second biggest marketplace is running on Solana would make me think that Solana is already ahead of the game compared to its current contemporary's. You mention network congestion, in the times I have used Solanas network I've only noticed slight slowdown when transferring from kraken exchange yesterday, transferring SOL or buying minted NFT's has been super quick in my experience and also let's not forget that in the future when this technology becomes more mainstream for transactions the vast majority of regular people are used to a transaction potentially taking minutes to complete using the regular means of transfer (banking etc). Again I'm not arguing Sol is better than Avalanche or any other blockchain, I'm just saying SOL is currently being used fairly heavily for real world applications (NFT's) and sometimes being first to market will be what ultimately sees a platform win or lose.				1645084558	{}	hxa7kjf	False	t3_subf8j	False	False	t3_subf8j	/r/solana/comments/subf8j/solana_losing_ground_to_avalanche/hxa7kjf/	1648884103.0	5	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n		0	[]

Unfortunately in this case I think the reputation might be negative for the polkadot as well. I’m not sure what and how will that happen, but something to consider. Another thing might be parachain auctions - higher bidder wins, that means its vulnerable to big money eating small players, but that assumes polka dot will be huge and being there would be privilige. Another is polka dot governence, as in every democracy its vulnerable to masses I believe. So if you try to force some stupid or breaking change into the system it might be possible thanks to stupidity of voters, but Im not sure tbh where votes come from, imo its something controlled by polkadot authorities for now. Tldr in my opinion every flaw in democracy and monopol can be applied to polka dot as well + any other blockchain issues in some sort of variation.
