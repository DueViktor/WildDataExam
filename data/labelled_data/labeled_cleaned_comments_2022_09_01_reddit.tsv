Hayek, 1984

And on that note, Frédéric Bastiat predated him

""When plunder becomes a way of life for a group of men living together in society, they create for themselves in the course of time a legal system that authorizes it and a moral code that glorifies it."" Frederic Bastiat, 1847

And since we are quoting left and right, 1988 Cryptoanarchist manifesto about NFTs.

""Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government  interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures.”

And 1992, Cypherpunk manifesto:

- ""Privacy is the power to selectively reveal 
oneself to the world.""
- ""We must defend our own privacy if we 
expect to have any.""
- ""We cannot expect governments, 
corporations or other large, faceless 
organizations to grant us privacy out of 
their benificence.""
- ""We are defending our privacy with 
cryptography, with anonymous 
mail-forwarding systems, with digital 
signatures, and with electronic money.""
- ""Our code is free for all to use, worldwide.
We don’t much care if you don’t approve of the software we write. We know that software can’t be destroyed and that a widely dispersed system can’t be

You don't need many states to coordinate. China had more than 50% of mining occurring on its own soil. 

At most, you'd probably need two states, right now. Or one state who's also seizing mining equipment directly from manufacturers. 

&gt;No legal implications at all, strictly tyrannical actions across multiple, most likely democratic, first world states to coerce miners?

What legal implication? You're talking about them trying to take control of a chain, they'd just have to say the chain has to be controlled by them and anyone who's in control of mining equipment should hand it over to the state. Anyone who doesn't comply has its equipment seized and considered criminal, because it's the law. Plain and simple. It's the state we're talking about. They are the ones defining the law. The state is the legal implication itself. 

It wouldn't even be the first time states would do such a thing, by the way. We had it with gold, already, after all.

&gt;You're talking killing people and blatant government crimes here.

Quote me saying the state would kill anyone that complies with the law. 

&gt;And it assumes that every single instance somehow works and everyone being coerced agrees to help.

No, it doesn't need to assume that in any way.

At this point, it's only a matter of time before they realize they've finally got a very stable and functional chain no one can seize. 

&gt;Don't really feel like going into a whole other convo on PoW but seems like you're using the example of essentially a metal wrench attack on miners? This theory could probably be done pretty easily to PoS validators with some easy chain analysis to identify owners. Food for thought. However I don't think either of those scenarios are realistic at all. It would require global coordination of police, gov, military, etc. And for what? To try and doublespend a transaction?

Not to double spend, to control the network, just the same as in PoS consensus attack attempts. It's the cheapest way of controlling the chain, and that cheapest way is easily doable with PoW. 

Besides, it's not hard to spot big mining farms at all. You just have to look at your electrical grid and that's it. Big electricity consumption are easy to spot. It's way harder to find validators once they know you're looking for them. The ones beforehand will have doxxed themselves, sure. But son't expect them not to be anonymous afterwards. They'll just use whatever they need to keep being anonymous. Chain analysis only works on people who don't know how to protect their data. 

And you really don't need the military to enforce laws onto people. Just some police officers are enough, just like in England. Unless we're taking about miners turning into mafia or such, but I wouldn't be expecting that. 

&gt;Realistically, any drastic attack on any network can be hard forked for repair, but it's never ideal.

No, a consensus attack on a PoW chain can't be hard forked for repair. Attackers can follow you, because you can't destroy their mining equipment. That's the very problem of PoW, besides economies of scale. 

&gt;But thinking that Ethereum is money is pretty ridiculous. It's pretty clear in the white paper that it is an application platform and never claims to be a monetary system.

It is an asset that can be used as money, just like any other asset. Just like gold. It just happens to be much easier to store, verify and transfer than gold, aka having much better properties. So, yeah, it has been designed as an asset. It can still be used as money. 

In any way, Ethereum is the network itself, the consensus of transactions. Any asset better designed to be a currency can live on it. And I fully agree with you it would be much better not to use Ethereum, the token, as money."	04a318c0c118324265940531bfb1c48b8831ea78	True	False					0	1661918472		0	{}	imhb8py	False	t3_x1tmeb	False	True	t1_imh90ic	/r/ethereum/comments/x1tmeb/friedrich_august_hayek_nobel_prize_laureate_in/imhb8py/	1661918485	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

So yes there are ways to limit inequality and one of those ways is to limit the market. A great book on this is How China Escaped Shock Therapy. 

About consented cooperation. Is it consented if Pinochet privatized everything and now you need to work for a monopoly who has more power than you do?

I mean all u would need to do is work at an Amazon facility for 1 week and it would be more than obvious. But I won't hold my breath. Nothing in capitalism is consented anymore.

As you said, the more blockchain technology takes hold, the more applications such as social networks or services for final users will begin to adopt the blockchain ""disguising"" it as normal 2.0 applications.

I guess that this is really the only way to make mass adoption a reality.

After that, in a few years, people will start to get to know blockchain better and not be afraid of it anymore, but for now, in my opinion, this is one of the few ways for real integration of this new technology.

Cheers!

1) Solend USDT/USDC borrow rates are much higher at 6-7% before liquidity mining incentives. But Solend would give you some small interest on your collateral deposit, which Hubble/Hedge do not.

2) On Hubble/Hedge you can pay back your loan and withdraw at any time, no matter what. On Solend if the pool utilization rate nears 100% (all assets are loaned out) then you may not be able to withdraw your collateral. This happened in June this year.

3) USDC/USDT are centralized stablecoins and could be subject to regulatory action such as address blacklisting or freezing of funds. There has been plenty of speculation on if Tether is really backed 1:1 or has risky commercial paper assets backing the token. USH/USDH are more decentralized and are overcollateralized by crypto assets. It is worth noting that both Hubble and Hedge have peg stability pools that are funded by USDC.

Then I asked if he was staking it. “Am I what now?..”  
It’s unbelievable how many people out there know Solana but have no idea not only about stake pools but about the actual concept of staking.  
So in my opinion, what would really help is a lot of easy to grasp, non-scary infographics on everything related to staking:  
how validators work in terms of securing Solana and delegators’ rewards;  
what is zero risk (staking), low risk (e.g. stabilized asset DeFi), medium to high risk (volatile asset DeFi);  
a map of Solana’s liquid staking and DeFi protocols would be awesome, etc.  
So basically a lot of materials to educate newcomers curious about Solana."	346e62e6f72782fc64d2b09f35f67bcfae61e9a2	True	False					0	1661949318		0	{}	imiioeg	False	t3_wzkijx	False	False	t3_wzkijx	/r/solana/comments/wzkijx/what_else_would_you_like_to_see_in_the_subreddit/imiioeg/	1661949333	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]

Stop lying for Charles Hoskinson. He's got plenty of money, he doesn't need you to defend his lies. He claimed many times to be a post graduate pursuing a PhD which he would later finish. All of those statements were lies. He never ""graduated,"" never started ""pursuing"" a PhD, and you can't ""finish"" a PhD you haven't started:

If you're going to pretend those aren't lies, there's no point in discussing cardano with you, because you're just going to repeat everything Charles says about cardano, even when it's obviously false (like the way you just casually maintained the contradiction that everything was on schedule with the roadmap in 2021, but for some reason Charles, the CEO and owner of Cardano's only core protocol development company, didn't know that Cardano would not possibly be capable of running thousands of dapps until 2023.)"	2eae282c310c4ad47b5f93ca2e44bc6864223598	True	False					0	1661964048		0	{}	imjik85	False	t3_wvoxmu	False	True	t1_imhyy35	/r/solana/comments/wvoxmu/solana_uses_2x_as_much_power_but_pushes_40x_as/imjik85/	1661964068	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]

I wouldn’t say this is “awful” for them, they’re basically moving away from using blockchain and are gonna run the network from a standard centralized server.

He didn't lie at all about it, I listened to the audio recordings and while it's somewhat ambiguous, it's definitely not a lie. He definitely did not say in any way he enrolled in a phd program, just that he was pursuing one at the time. The interviewers' way of questioning is what makes it ambiguous, I probably would've given an similar reply. 

Smart contracts weren't rushed either, just split into multiple phases, as they've done a lot. First native assets, then Plutus V1, for developers to start building, to gather feedback, etc. Sure it got congested, scaling is #4 on the road map, it was never meant to be fast already.

Nothing is rushed, as it's simply not meant to be used as a daily driver yet, and Charles has always been clear about it and tempered people's expectations in his vids.

I know about IELE and KEVM, those are on hold and that's cool, the market and their needs change over time. These were features that are not so important at this time, and I personally don't see their added value anyway. 

He didn't lie about the thousands of dapps either, he started the sentence even with ""I predict"". We all get ahead of ourselves in the heat of the moment.

I've read your blog, you seem ambitious, you have the right attitude, but not really grasping the full idea of your NFT project or even what your approach is considering the lack of an established community. 

You're twitter has followers which is a good sign, considering it's now been around for a year. 

I have a few couple questions:

 \- Do you already have your NFT collection or website w roadmap etc?

\- Could you explain more about your approach to this project considering you're asking for experienced partners?

You said you lack the ability to write in Rust, why exactly do you need this language in particular to your NFT venture? Are you or have been a programmer in your past?

Perhaps you should give more of a backstory to yourself. What technical knowledge you have, business experience, failed projects in the past. etc. before you try looking for partners. We all have struggles, but people here want to know your IDEAS, past, present, future, so ppl can see you're transparent, and ambitious. 

I've started an NFT project myself from zero. Still at zero. But it took me 5 months for the collection itself, design, art, scripting etc. Even in this bear market, where I do believe there is  TON of potential for REAL followers, yet it's still difficult to find the right, creative methods required to gain the critical mass necessary. IMO to grow a community, be transparent as possible with your ideas and execute small goals on a daily to weekly basis to prove legitimacy. 

I'm still interested in why you're looking for a technical cofounder for an NFT project in it's early stages. If you could right another post explaining more deeply about I would love to read it. I've started a small venture in 2014 that was a social media platform, long story short, don't make your friends without experience founders. But it sure makes for a good story years later. Lol. 

Interested to hear more from you,

However, the picture in the article highlights a section of the targets page that says ""min nominated/threshold"" and the page I see just shows lowest/avg staked (1.8647M/2.1508MDOT).

Also, I read in the same article about rebagging, but my ""bags"" page doesn't show any button in the area highlighted, either rebag, or move up 4 shown in the picture.
