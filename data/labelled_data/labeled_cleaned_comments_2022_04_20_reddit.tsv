If you are alluding to the fact that it is not EVM compatible, you'd be right-- but there's only a couple EVM compatible L2's using Zk proofs,  zksync and Starknet which have not ""taken off"" in the literal sense, either.

We are in the midst of pretty big coming of age of Zk roll-ups actually
It is easier to create an EVM compatible L2 using optimistic- they possess market share at current moment (sort of), but things are changing and its too early to call, anything really. It seems Loopring is working hard on their EVM composability.

I don't hold LRC(disclaimer) but operating an NFT marketplace for one of the most talked about companies in the last 2 years does mean something.

* Watch the open kitchen where the chefs discuss how the NFTs and governanace are tied together: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2h7jJSbyU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2h7jJSbyU)
* There's still time to race with ALS: [https://twitter.com/MarinadeFinance/status/1515327402951548930](https://twitter.com/MarinadeFinance/status/1515327402951548930)
* You can level up your marinade NFT. This involves locking more tasty $MNDE into your favorite octopus
* The team also helped ship a new important piece of code called ""[The Decentralizer](https://twitter.com/MarinadeFinance/status/1514669570342141963)""

There's so much building taking place that I strongly encourage visiting one of the friendliest discord groups in the ecosystem at [marinade.finance](https://marinade.finance) (follow the links from there).
