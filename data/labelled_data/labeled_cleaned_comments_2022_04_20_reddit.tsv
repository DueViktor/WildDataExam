You’re giving up all of the use cases that require state level censorship resistance to PoW chains (most likely BTC), and ETH PoS is still going to be horrendously inefficient compared to centralized services like AWS and more centralized blockchains that are going to be perfectly suitable for a lot of the use cases like ticketing and gaming NFTs. It doesn’t matter if it’s more efficient or has more capacity than BTC, it’s still in the middle ground when the full range of platforms are taken into account. By trying to be everything to everyone it’s going to end up being nothing to anyone.

yeah sorry but ethereum smart contracts make it possible to implement decentralized/non-custodial lending platforms (see: aave). borrowing/lending is a fundamental building block of all finance.

if you want to borrow against your BTC you have two options, you deposit it as collateral with a centralized company (remember, not your keys, not your crypto) or you convert it to WBTC on the ethereum blockchain and use defi lending (your keys, your crypto)

we don't just want to replace the world's money. We want to replace all the financial instruments that banks provide.

We are in the midst of pretty big coming of age of Zk roll-ups actually
It is easier to create an EVM compatible L2 using optimistic- they possess market share at current moment (sort of), but things are changing and its too early to call, anything really. It seems Loopring is working hard on their EVM composability.

I don't hold LRC(disclaimer) but operating an NFT marketplace for one of the most talked about companies in the last 2 years does mean something.

After all, it's to get rid of the competitive advantages they have over the many other, smaller miners that PoS has been designed. PoS is way better for the many small miners who are in a pool and have to pay (many, frequent transaction fees) because they pay (taxes due to the tokens they frequently sell) because they pay (their electricity bills). The level of inefficiency of this model is extreme. It's way better to get rid of all the costs beyond opportunity costs and allow the consensus actors to decide about the frequency of their sales without any pressure to pay anything with it.	c72c78868ace4bbb84dec94c205e6f1a20df1f8d	True	False					0	1650399463		0	{}	i5e1d0k	False	t3_u6v9jr	False	True	t1_i5bu45y	/r/ethereum/comments/u6v9jr/who_decided_to_move_ethereum_to_proof_of_stake/i5e1d0k/	1650399481	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

* You can level up your marinade NFT. This involves locking more tasty $MNDE into your favorite octopus
* The team also helped ship a new important piece of code called ""[The Decentralizer](https://twitter.com/MarinadeFinance/status/1514669570342141963)""

There's so much building taking place that I strongly encourage visiting one of the friendliest discord groups in the ecosystem at [marinade.finance](https://marinade.finance) (follow the links from there).
