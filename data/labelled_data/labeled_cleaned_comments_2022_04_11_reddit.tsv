So lots of cryptos try to fix this by developing their own layer 1 solution, often thinking or at least claiming they can make a system that can scale to accommodate all those payments on their L1, generally at some cost in terms of decentralization. Lightning runs on top of Bitcoin as an L2 solution and is so fast that it can be even used for streaming payments (think paying per second for watching a video) and is designed in such a way that it becomes **faster** the more nodes join (think torrents) whilst the underlying asset is real BTC which is the most decentralized, hardest money we have. So you know have your digital gold but you can take bits of your gold, put it in your checking account for small payments and only pay for wiring BTC into/out of Lightning.

Or Bitcoin's hashrate could be larger because extremely cheap electricity could be more readily available in 2056 and that would be okay. We also don't know how efficient SHA-256 hashing ASICs will be in 2056.

Consider this: Bcash's hashrate fluctuates between 0.4% and 0.8% of Bitcoin's hashrate and the Bcash block reward plus transaction fees equals approximately $2,300 worth of BCH per block. Bitcoin miners already often mine blocks that have transaction fees that are worth more than Bcash's block reward and transaction fees combined.

The bitcoin mining difficulty automatically adjusts every 2016 blocks which is approximately every two weeks. The mining difficulty automatically increases or decreases after 2016 blocks depending on the time between the previous 2016 blocks. If the time between those blocks averages out to less than ten minutes, then the mining difficulty will increase and miners will become less profitable. If the time between those blocks averages out to more than ten minutes, then the mining difficulty will decrease and miners will become more profitable.

So if some bitcoin miners stop mining bitcoin because it's unprofitable for them, the difficulty decreases and it becomes more profitable to mine bitcoin."	f50bc0ec8102ead2c0131066800e54cf0448bfe4	True	False					0	1649561162		0	{}	i44b6sq	False	t3_u06xyq	False	False	t3_u06xyq	/r/Bitcoin/comments/u06xyq/does_this_logic_sound_correct/i44b6sq/	1649561178	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]			the bitcoin network is currently far more secure than it needs to be bitcoin s hashrate could be smaller in 2056 and that would be okay or bitcoin s hashrate could be larger because extremely cheap electricity could be more readily available in 2056 and that would be okay we also don t know how efficient sha 256 hashing asics will be in 2056 consider this bcash s hashrate fluctuates between 0 4 and 0 8 of bitcoin s hashrate and the bcash block reward plus transaction fees equals approximately 2 300 worth of bch per block bitcoin miners already often mine blocks that have transaction fees that are worth more than bcash s block reward and transaction fees combined the bitcoin mining difficulty automatically adjusts every 2016 blocks which is approximately every two weeks the mining difficulty automatically increases or decreases after 2016 blocks depending on the time between the previous 2016 blocks if the time between those blocks averages out to less than ten minutes then the mining difficulty will increase and miners will become less profitable if the time between those blocks averages out to more than ten minutes then the mining difficulty will decrease and miners will become more profitable so if some bitcoin miners stop mining bitcoin because it s unprofitable for them the difficulty decreases and it becomes more profitable to mine bitcoin 	0.0007312778616324067	0.9956529140472412	0.3411916196346283	0.9780148267745972	0.0038425696548074484	0.06464652717113495	0.09228397160768509	8.385174510294746e-07	0.27974507212638855	0.0006125598447397351

As batteries age they also don't hold a charge as well.
Is battery tech gonna improve? Cause even now its kinda shit.

I forgot my wallet instead will become ""Ah shit, I forgot to charge my wallet!"" ?

**Natural spread** \- exists on all exchanges, of course.  The difference between best bid and best ask.

**Exchange-enforced spread** \- exists on some exchanges, especially when they try to pretend they're doing you a solid by simplifying the interface so you only have to point and click buy/sell + a price.

Why u/Ok_Aerie3546 may think spread is a problem even for limit orders: depending on the spread (low liquidity and/or exchange-enforced making for the most spread), the above translates into one of 2 bad cases

1. Opportunity cost: if your order isn't hit because the true price and the effective price were that different.  Buy $1000, but my exchange is telling me price is $1100, and before I'm hit the price goes up to $2000
2. Bad trade: if your order *is hit*, and it was hit at an awful price because of how different the true and effective prices are.  Buy $1000, it's hit, and in reality the price is $800.  I'm 20% in the hole from the get-go.

This is only an issue with **large spreads**, and is completely ignorable otherwise, so I'd say your opinion (no spread on a limit order) holds in general.

Just the same it's just the owner of ETH which changes - ETH isn't really in NFTs and gets recreated when the NFTs get resold.

Price will go up to 6-8 bucks cause of all the money US printed. Bitcoin top at 2017 was around 20k and 2021 went as high to 60k tripling and same goes for ethereum. It all tripled from previous high from 2017-2018. Xrp was at 3 bucks in 2018 before this bullshit sec. So now there are less xrp compared to 2018 cause it constantly gets burned and top of that United States printed crazy amount of money.
