(1) It’s $10 for each $100 deposited on your first stake, capped at $50 promo or $500 deposit
(2)To my understanding, the option to unstake will happen once ETH2.0 is fully launched, but I’ve also read that it could be a few months afterwards.  

I’m used to 401k and Roth IRA contributions, and have found great peace in that.  It’s truly not a concern of mine whether or not I have access to rEth.  I think I’m better-suited focusing on increasing my main source of income and letting investments work over the long haul.  

With you response comes my questions:

(1) Is it possible to utilize Rocketpool or Lido from a cold storage?  I like the idea of consolidating my holdings, moreso when it’s on my cold storage.
(2) Around what $value does it become reasonable to send ETH off exchange?  I’ve dabbled a little bit with gas calculators, but I think I’m too stupid to understand them.

In such circumstances, a PoW-based network is lost to centralized censorship. 

And that's what China could have done last year. When they forbid mining activities, they had more than 50% of the mining power on their soil. Within months, they reduced it to nearly 0%.

In no normal blockchain (bitcoin and ethereum included) can you break the rules. i.e. no number of miners or stakers can make an update that takes your money without your signature. **What miners and stakers can do is play with the timing of events, and in an attacks, do it retrospectively (re-org).** In PoW chains, a 51% attack pays for itself, and the attacker gets the block reward, fees and the gains from the re-org. So the main hurdle is the huge up-front capital (and in the case of bitcoin, of machines that can do little else). In PoS, after finality (normally &lt;15 minutes), any re-org will cause slashing of at least 1/3 of stakers, so 4M ETH will be burned. So to make a relatively short re-org, one would need to burn &gt;$8B, which is significantly more than the economic gains that one can have. A few minor points - you can see a re-org coming, as the number of stakers signing will go down from 99.9% to \~66%. Setting up such an attack will take not only money, but time, at which the preparations may be very visible (need to buy/deposit for a 2/3 majority), so if you plan an attack today, and haven't deposited ETH yet, you need 24M ETH (double the current stake), plus 2x whatever ETH flow in until you attack, plus the time to deposit all of this (at \~1300 validators = \~41,000ETH per day ATM).

&gt;Rollups move computation (and state storage) off-chain, but keep some data per transaction on-chain.

&gt;The fact that data is on-chain is key. Putting data on-chain and having consensus on that fact allows anyone to locally process all the operations in the rollup if they wish to, allowing them to detect fraud, initiate withdrawals, or personally start producing transaction batches. The lack of data availability issues means that a malicious or offline operator can do even less harm (eg. they cannot cause a 1 week delay), opening up a much larger design space for who has the right to publish batches and making rollups vastly easier to reason about. And most importantly, the lack of data availability issues means that there is no longer any need to map assets to owners, leading to the key reason why the Ethereum community is so much more excited about rollups than previous forms of layer 2 scaling: rollups are fully general-purpose, and one can even run an EVM inside a rollup, allowing existing Ethereum applications to migrate to rollups with almost no need to write any new code.

I do that all the time, that's almost my job. There is a direct relationship, and why halvings are a meme.

&gt;And yes, miners are transferring their coin - of course they will.  But that doesn't mean it's being transferred in a price-setting activity. 

That doesn't make sense. There's no way to satisfy $30,000,000 of *daily* purchase orders without affecting the public market. If that entity didn't have a miner to buy from OTC they'd have to buy OTM instead which would affect the price. If miners aren't reducing the price they're preventing it from increasing.


&gt;Remember, bitcoin or eth is not priced based on the ""worth"" of the whole lot of 'em divided by the number of 'em (if it was, increasing the number would decrease the price, and the rest of your math all makes sense). 

Crypto absolutely is priced by market cap. If someone minted 21,000,000 BTC right now that would effectively make each one worth half as much.

&gt;It's priced on the margin by the volume of money changing hands.  

Which is directly affected by the total circulating supply.

&gt;People do not just buy bitcoin (or ETH) from miners.  They buy it from each other.   More is bought from non-miners than from miners.  Ergo, the massively dominant determination of price is sentiment.  Period.  Pricing expect by issuance is a fools game.

It doesn't matter if miners are selling to people or not, they're still diluting the markets. My point is they're diluting the markets by $30M each day, over $10Bln each year, to say that has zero effect on price is niave. Crypto has mega volume each day but $10Bln flowing out of it is enough to make a big dent.

People spend more than $30M for ETH blockspace per day when the markets are healthy. Now only $3M will be added to the market each day. Even if for the last **5 years** people were getting excessive ETH for mining (all this off-chain trading you mention) in **6 months** all of that will be used up (taken out of circulation forever) at today's rate of fee-burn. It doesn't matter how much ETH is traded off-chain because it's going to be bought and taken on-chain to generate more income with, then burned, reducing the amount off-chain by at least $10Bln/yr.

Sentiment affects demand but it doesn't affect supply. Right now demand is extremely high and the sentiment doesn't appear to be changing anytime soon, if that carries into the supply crush there aren't many other variables to adjust before the price gets affected."	20f43c86026f03784112a313fd3858cecad1e9ad	True	False					0	1654005698		0	{}	ianwfk5	True	t3_v12szg	False	True	t1_ianass2	/r/ethereum/comments/v12szg/will_all_the_stakers_sell_post_eth_merge_crashing/ianwfk5/	1654005714	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]			 gt don t just watch the halvenings plot price over time on one axis and issuance over time on another axis if there s a relationship it will show up or not do that for multiple currencies i do that all the time that s almost my job there is a direct relationship and why halvings are a meme gt and yes miners are transferring their coin of course they will but that doesn t mean it s being transferred in a price setting activity that doesn t make sense there s no way to satisfy 30 000 000 of daily purchase orders without affecting the public market if that entity didn t have a miner to buy from otc they d have to buy otm instead which would affect the price if miners aren t reducing the price they re preventing it from increasing gt remember bitcoin or eth is not priced based on the worth of the whole lot of em divided by the number of em if it was increasing the number would decrease the price and the rest of your math all makes sense crypto absolutely is priced by market cap if someone minted 21 000 000 btc right now that would effectively make each one worth half as much gt it s priced on the margin by the volume of money changing hands which is directly affected by the total circulating supply gt people do not just buy bitcoin or eth from miners they buy it from each other more is bought from non miners than from miners ergo the massively dominant determination of price is sentiment period pricing expect by issuance is a fools game it doesn t matter if miners are selling to people or not they re still diluting the markets my point is they re diluting the markets by 30m each day over 10bln each year to say that has zero effect on price is niave crypto has mega volume each day but 10bln flowing out of it is enough to make a big dent people spend more than 30m for eth blockspace per day when the markets are healthy now only 3m will be added to the market each day even if for the last 5 years people were getting excessive eth for mining all this off chain trading you mention in 6 months all of that will be used up taken out of circulation forever at today s rate of fee burn it doesn t matter how much eth is traded off chain because it s going to be bought and taken on chain to generate more income with then burned reducing the amount off chain by at least 10bln yr sentiment affects demand but it doesn t affect supply right now demand is extremely high and the sentiment doesn t appear to be changing anytime soon if that carries into the supply crush there aren t many other variables to adjust before the price gets affected 	0.0027355276979506016	0.9885532855987549	0.18017277121543884	0.018399395048618317	0.008796192705631256	0.46694016456604004	0.08282703906297684	8.420586254942464e-07	0.38560086488723755	0.015941975638270378

I think we're saying the same thing. Obviously I'm not looking at issuance without looking at how much demand there is on the other side also.

There is *crazy* demand for ETH blockspace. That's why I'm so bullish about an issuance reduction.

BTC sells like $400K of blockspace per day and issues $35M to miners. When it has a halving that leads to a supply shock sending us into a bull run each time. Over $400K of demand... Ethereum has about as much daily issuance except $10-30M daily demand for its space, and after reducing its issuance to $3M it'll make it the very first blockchain in existence to dish out less in issuance than people are paying to use it. I don't anticipate people buying *less* blockspace in the future if they haven't backed off in the bear market at all.


&gt;Let's say you have 10 tokens in cold storage and have never touched them.  Let's say I have 1 token and I am in need of a kidney and someone with a kidney wants 0.5 tokens.   I give them my half token and I get their kidney.

It's like saying people spend $10M on ETH blockspace per day. Let's say $30M of blockspace is given out for free each day and the price is rising. Now let's say only $3M is given out free instead.

That's like if I have 10 kidneys in cold storage during a time the world loses 90% of its free kidney supply. Nothing is going to inherently make my kidneys more valuable if the market doesn't want them of course. If this happens during a time kidneys are *already* scarce there are no other variables to affect *but* price though (incentivizing cold storage coins to go on the market) until all 'kidney' demand is met or all 'kidneys' are gone. If demand dries up at a $20K ETH because no transaction can generate more income than gas costs at that price then the price will quit trending toward infinity but any time there's 10x more demand than supply it's going to be hard to supress."	74d47d133a0515c77d742cc7d91b1c917581a6c3	True	False					0	1654004682		0	{}	ianub7v	True	t3_v12szg	False	True	t1_ianbfjg	/r/ethereum/comments/v12szg/will_all_the_stakers_sell_post_eth_merge_crashing/ianub7v/	1654004693	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]			 gt defi is causing tokens to be priced based on supply demand relationships between tokens if you d don t see this and you make pricing decisions solely based on issuance you are going to be eviscerated i think we re saying the same thing obviously i m not looking at issuance without looking at how much demand there is on the other side also there is crazy demand for eth blockspace that s why i m so bullish about an issuance reduction btc sells like 400k of blockspace per day and issues 35m to miners when it has a halving that leads to a supply shock sending us into a bull run each time over 400k of demand ethereum has about as much daily issuance except 10 30m daily demand for its space and after reducing its issuance to 3m it ll make it the very first blockchain in existence to dish out less in issuance than people are paying to use it i don t anticipate people buying less blockspace in the future if they haven t backed off in the bear market at all gt let s say you have 10 tokens in cold storage and have never touched them let s say i have 1 token and i am in need of a kidney and someone with a kidney wants 0 5 tokens i give them my half token and i get their kidney it s like saying people spend 10m on eth blockspace per day let s say 30m of blockspace is given out for free each day and the price is rising now let s say only 3m is given out free instead that s like if i have 10 kidneys in cold storage during a time the world loses 90 of its free kidney supply nothing is going to inherently make my kidneys more valuable if the market doesn t want them of course if this happens during a time kidneys are already scarce there are no other variables to affect but price though incentivizing cold storage coins to go on the market until all kidney demand is met or all kidneys are gone if demand dries up at a 20k eth because no transaction can generate more income than gas costs at that price then the price will quit trending toward infinity but any time there s 10x more demand than supply it s going to be hard to supress 	0.002243083668872714	0.9888181090354919	0.4327612519264221	0.018486380577087402	0.007626956794410944	0.3124709129333496	0.06858029216527939	8.558544095649268e-07	0.28265640139579773	0.004061583895236254

2.) That’s simply a math question based on how long you’ll be staking and the fees related to getting them on/off the exchange. Staking rates are typically about 4% APY right now (although they should rise after the merge). So, for every $100 worth of ETH you stake for one year, you’re going to gain $4. You need to ensure the gas you’re paying is (ideally much) lower than than the yield you get the amount you transfer.

I didn't. You asked different questions, I answered different questions.

&gt;Why would I invest in it?

I don't care if you invest in it or not. Do Your Own Research. But to do so, you'd first need to empty your glass. Stop claiming you know everything about blockchain and what it can or can't provide, because you won't learn anything with these unbacked beliefs. 

I can answer questions if you'd like, but it won't benefit you if you're so adamant about unfounded claims regarding blockchains. 

&gt;So let me ask, how would blockchain meaningfully improve my job in the food supply chain? 

I already answered this question. Here:

You're right. That's not the goal.

&gt;doesn't fix them, doesn't save any money. The logistics software we have now is far better, 

Would you mind to prove your claims, for once?

&gt;many major businesses don't want their activities on a public ledger

Care to tell how it's relevant? Many candle users didn't want to use light bulbs. So what? Dinosaurs are everywhere. It's ok, they'll simply be replaced. Like the ones who didn't want to use computers back then. 

&gt;Blockchains are slow, inefficient, and expensive things

You're still missing the point of the service. It's sad, but expected, knowing you. 

Besides, that's a whole lot of text to make a lot of claims so that you dodge a very simple proof by a *working business example*. 

I wonder when you will stop. Given your trajectory, I'd say you won't, even if faced with lots of business activities using them. 

You're just like some people, back then, when planes weren't yet working. Whatever's heavier than birds can't fly, they claimed. Some still claimed it even with planes flying. They just moved on to claim it will inevitably crash. Just like you'll move on to claim crypto will inevitably crash. People will use it, knowing it or not, for decades, and you'll still claim it will inevitably crash, oblivious to the fact it didn't crash and has proven to be at least way more stable than whatever it replaced.

Proof of Stake isn't new at all to me although it will be to Ethereum.  Helium did proof of coverage and that is pretty interesting.  

I'm all for governance-types of solutions as one of my main complaints is that proof of stake is taking a huge amount of power out of the hands of the people and putting it in at best (and literally) a pool of validators who have 32 ETH.  

Your solution puts some more checks and balances back in that were just kind of ""lost"" in the Proof of Stake transition without any real thought put toward how is that still going to happen in the future.

Yes I know about microvalidating / validator pools, but the earnings are already bad for full validators and I'm certain I mine more ETH with 3 GPUs in a day then they will earn in a year microvalidating (it's down to about $11-$12 a day with 8 GPUs that I've had going since Nov 2020).

You need a \*lot\* of money to stake and make anything like what you can make with a few thousand bucks of GPUs.  That same few thousand bucks will take years if not decades to earn what was redistributed to average hardware in a day/week!"	e95ae3b713f166e1b9ec905fe0f6d2899617e7b4	True	False					0	1654032285		0	{}	iapks23	False	t3_v1mno7	False	True	t1_iapji9l	/r/ethereum/comments/v1mno7/i_feel_like_ethereums_scalability_issue_is/iapks23/	1654032299	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]			that s a fair take i know everyone is focused on proof of work s impending and looking toward proof of stake and i m honestly trying to look at what is past that what is the evolution past proof of stake proof of stake isn t new at all to me although it will be to ethereum helium did proof of coverage and that is pretty interesting i m all for governance types of solutions as one of my main complaints is that proof of stake is taking a huge amount of power out of the hands of the people and putting it in at best and literally a pool of validators who have 32 eth your solution puts some more checks and balances back in that were just kind of lost in the proof of stake transition without any real thought put toward how is that still going to happen in the future yes i know about microvalidating validator pools but the earnings are already bad for full validators and i m certain i mine more eth with 3 gpus in a day then they will earn in a year microvalidating it s down to about 11 12 a day with 8 gpus that i ve had going since nov 2020 you need a lot of money to stake and make anything like what you can make with a few thousand bucks of gpus that same few thousand bucks will take years if not decades to earn what was redistributed to average hardware in a day week 	0.002256391104310751	0.9890285730361938	0.5270861983299255	0.025317801162600517	0.0074922628700733185	0.5298705697059631	0.07634348422288895	8.539327609469183e-07	0.18361824750900269	0.013699416071176529
