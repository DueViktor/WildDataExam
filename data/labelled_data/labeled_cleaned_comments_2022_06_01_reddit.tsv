(1) It’s $10 for each $100 deposited on your first stake, capped at $50 promo or $500 deposit
(2)To my understanding, the option to unstake will happen once ETH2.0 is fully launched, but I’ve also read that it could be a few months afterwards.  

I’m used to 401k and Roth IRA contributions, and have found great peace in that.  It’s truly not a concern of mine whether or not I have access to rEth.  I think I’m better-suited focusing on increasing my main source of income and letting investments work over the long haul.  

With you response comes my questions:

(1) Is it possible to utilize Rocketpool or Lido from a cold storage?  I like the idea of consolidating my holdings, moreso when it’s on my cold storage.
(2) Around what $value does it become reasonable to send ETH off exchange?  I’ve dabbled a little bit with gas calculators, but I think I’m too stupid to understand them.

Also online you have to make sure you are loading in the 100% correct link. I haven’t staked so am unsure about requirements there for pool staking but if possible I’d send as little as possible and make sure it’s in the correct spot and always double check the transaction before you confirm. Sending money off exchange for the first time can be nerve wracking it goes from clicking buy eth to send to this contract address and make sure you are on the correct chain when doing so.	558c46ed6395d0c280fde19dfeed64806bcab2a9	True	False					0	1653982398		0	{}	iamzcrv	False	t3_v1f7ds	False	True	t1_iamxhv1	/r/ethereum/comments/v1f7ds/best_avenue_for_staking_eth_with_my_financial/iamzcrv/	1653982412	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

It's important to note that you're talking about a full block reward: 51% of power provides 100% of the reward through reorg and ensures every other miner receives 0%. This means competing against a successful 51% attack isn't sustainable and that you can't get rid of such attack through a fork. In such circumstances, a PoW-based network is lost to centralized censorship. 

And that's what China could have done last year. When they forbid mining activities, they had more than 50% of the mining power on their soil. Within months, they reduced it to nearly 0%. Instead of shutting it all down, they could very well have seized all the equipment and mined themselves, essentially succeeding at a 51% attack. They didn't seize the opportunity, which is very fortunate, but it's an opportunity that could easily happen again. 

Within a PoS-based chain, you can always count on Layer 0 to fork away the attacker, destroying ~100% of their staked funds in the process."	8f1b8732aa4408da0643dade241102fb1d97887e	True	False					0	1653977575		0	{}	iamtmxa	False	t3_v1b335	False	True	t1_iamqf86	/r/ethereum/comments/v1b335/will_the_merge_makes_ethereum_secured_by_only_12m/iamtmxa/	1653977588	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

In no normal blockchain (bitcoin and ethereum included) can you break the rules. i.e. no number of miners or stakers can make an update that takes your money without your signature. **What miners and stakers can do is play with the timing of events, and in an attacks, do it retrospectively (re-org).** In PoW chains, a 51% attack pays for itself, and the attacker gets the block reward, fees and the gains from the re-org. So the main hurdle is the huge up-front capital (and in the case of bitcoin, of machines that can do little else). In PoS, after finality (normally &lt;15 minutes), any re-org will cause slashing of at least 1/3 of stakers, so 4M ETH will be burned. So to make a relatively short re-org, one would need to burn &gt;$8B, which is significantly more than the economic gains that one can have. A few minor points - you can see a re-org coming, as the number of stakers signing will go down from 99.9% to \~66%. Setting up such an attack will take not only money, but time, at which the preparations may be very visible (need to buy/deposit for a 2/3 majority), so if you plan an attack today, and haven't deposited ETH yet, you need 24M ETH (double the current stake), plus 2x whatever ETH flow in until you attack, plus the time to deposit all of this (at \~1300 validators = \~41,000ETH per day ATM). Attacking bitcoin without a factory for ASIC is similarly very hard.	e4ecd25ccdd4f57392f178fbca3fce925e73a5b6	True	False					0	1653975134		0	{}	iamqf86	False	t3_v1b335	False	True	t3_v1b335	/r/ethereum/comments/v1b335/will_the_merge_makes_ethereum_secured_by_only_12m/iamqf86/	1653975150	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

So say you submit a transaction on a rollup. How long does it typically take before it is ultimately finalized on L1?

You mint an NFT on a rollup. Does the NFT still exist natively on L1 or would it need to be minted again to make it to L1 or a different rollup? If you do have to mint again, does that mean they are technically 2 different NFTs?"	bfd53a203eb0d807e250c7b5365cee41d7a30d6b	True	False					0	1654010581		0	{}	iao7bjv	False	t3_v1mno7	False	True	t1_iao65to	/r/ethereum/comments/v1mno7/i_feel_like_ethereums_scalability_issue_is/iao7bjv/	1654010600	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

Here's the important bit about that:

* The Rollup validator(s) can never corrupt the state or steal funds (unlike Sidechains).


*Users can always retrieve the funds from the Rollup even if validator(s) stop cooperating because the data is available (unlike Plasma).


* Thanks to validity proofs, neither users nor a single trusted third party needs to be online to monitor Rollup blocks in order to prevent fraud (unlike fraud-proof systems, such as payment channels or optimistic rollups)."	a0bf7f6890c5b3e22d602d99f9673b70b4314f11	True	False					0	1654010083		0	{}	iao65to	False	t3_v1mno7	False	True	t1_ianzxq4	/r/ethereum/comments/v1mno7/i_feel_like_ethereums_scalability_issue_is/iao65to/	1654010095	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

&gt;Rollups move computation (and state storage) off-chain, but keep some data per transaction on-chain.

&gt;The fact that data is on-chain is key. Putting data on-chain and having consensus on that fact allows anyone to locally process all the operations in the rollup if they wish to, allowing them to detect fraud, initiate withdrawals, or personally start producing transaction batches. The lack of data availability issues means that a malicious or offline operator can do even less harm (eg. they cannot cause a 1 week delay), opening up a much larger design space for who has the right to publish batches and making rollups vastly easier to reason about. And most importantly, the lack of data availability issues means that there is no longer any need to map assets to owners, leading to the key reason why the Ethereum community is so much more excited about rollups than previous forms of layer 2 scaling: rollups are fully general-purpose, and one can even run an EVM inside a rollup, allowing existing Ethereum applications to migrate to rollups with almost no need to write any new code.

I do that all the time, that's almost my job. There is a direct relationship, and why halvings are a meme.

&gt;And yes, miners are transferring their coin - of course they will.  But that doesn't mean it's being transferred in a price-setting activity. 

That doesn't make sense. There's no way to satisfy $30,000,000 of *daily* purchase orders without affecting the public market. If that entity didn't have a miner to buy from OTC they'd have to buy OTM instead which would affect the price. If miners aren't reducing the price they're preventing it from increasing.


&gt;Remember, bitcoin or eth is not priced based on the ""worth"" of the whole lot of 'em divided by the number of 'em (if it was, increasing the number would decrease the price, and the rest of your math all makes sense). 

Crypto absolutely is priced by market cap. If someone minted 21,000,000 BTC right now that would effectively make each one worth half as much.

&gt;It's priced on the margin by the volume of money changing hands.  

Which is directly affected by the total circulating supply.

&gt;People do not just buy bitcoin (or ETH) from miners.  They buy it from each other.   More is bought from non-miners than from miners.  Ergo, the massively dominant determination of price is sentiment.  Period.  Pricing expect by issuance is a fools game.

It doesn't matter if miners are selling to people or not, they're still diluting the markets. My point is they're diluting the markets by $30M each day, over $10Bln each year, to say that has zero effect on price is niave. Crypto has mega volume each day but $10Bln flowing out of it is enough to make a big dent.

People spend more than $30M for ETH blockspace per day when the markets are healthy. Now only $3M will be added to the market each day. Even if for the last **5 years** people were getting excessive ETH for mining (all this off-chain trading you mention) in **6 months** all of that will be used up (taken out of circulation forever) at today's rate of fee-burn. It doesn't matter how much ETH is traded off-chain because it's going to be bought and taken on-chain to generate more income with, then burned, reducing the amount off-chain by at least $10Bln/yr.

Sentiment affects demand but it doesn't affect supply. Right now demand is extremely high and the sentiment doesn't appear to be changing anytime soon, if that carries into the supply crush there aren't many other variables to adjust before the price gets affected."	20f43c86026f03784112a313fd3858cecad1e9ad	True	False					0	1654005698		0	{}	ianwfk5	True	t3_v12szg	False	True	t1_ianass2	/r/ethereum/comments/v12szg/will_all_the_stakers_sell_post_eth_merge_crashing/ianwfk5/	1654005714	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

I think we're saying the same thing. Obviously I'm not looking at issuance without looking at how much demand there is on the other side also.

There is *crazy* demand for ETH blockspace. That's why I'm so bullish about an issuance reduction.

BTC sells like $400K of blockspace per day and issues $35M to miners. When it has a halving that leads to a supply shock sending us into a bull run each time. Over $400K of demand... Ethereum has about as much daily issuance except $10-30M daily demand for its space, and after reducing its issuance to $3M it'll make it the very first blockchain in existence to dish out less in issuance than people are paying to use it. I don't anticipate people buying *less* blockspace in the future if they haven't backed off in the bear market at all.


&gt;Let's say you have 10 tokens in cold storage and have never touched them.  Let's say I have 1 token and I am in need of a kidney and someone with a kidney wants 0.5 tokens.   I give them my half token and I get their kidney.

It's like saying people spend $10M on ETH blockspace per day. Let's say $30M of blockspace is given out for free each day and the price is rising. Now let's say only $3M is given out free instead.

That's like if I have 10 kidneys in cold storage during a time the world loses 90% of its free kidney supply. Nothing is going to inherently make my kidneys more valuable if the market doesn't want them of course. If this happens during a time kidneys are *already* scarce there are no other variables to affect *but* price though (incentivizing cold storage coins to go on the market) until all 'kidney' demand is met or all 'kidneys' are gone. If demand dries up at a $20K ETH because no transaction can generate more income than gas costs at that price then the price will quit trending toward infinity but any time there's 10x more demand than supply it's going to be hard to supress."	74d47d133a0515c77d742cc7d91b1c917581a6c3	True	False					0	1654004682		0	{}	ianub7v	True	t3_v12szg	False	True	t1_ianbfjg	/r/ethereum/comments/v12szg/will_all_the_stakers_sell_post_eth_merge_crashing/ianub7v/	1654004693	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

Both RP and Lido do allow/require you to connect a wallet - but I don’t believe it’s for the security features your question seems to imply.

2.) That’s simply a math question based on how long you’ll be staking and the fees related to getting them on/off the exchange. Staking rates are typically about 4% APY right now (although they should rise after the merge). So, for every $100 worth of ETH you stake for one year, you’re going to gain $4. You need to ensure the gas you’re paying is (ideally much) lower than than the yield you get the amount you transfer. You should also keep in mind for the fees getting it back out of the staking pool and onto and exchange/wallet, although you could theoretically consolidate multiple previous “deposits” into a single “withdrawal” later on for a more streamlined fee."	ea8fb9a1f4983dbe7f621315a5423c48e342d2a2	True	False					0	1654001129		0	{}	ianngjk	False	t3_v1f7ds	False	True	t1_ian0oj4	/r/ethereum/comments/v1f7ds/best_avenue_for_staking_eth_with_my_financial/ianngjk/	1654001143	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

I can answer questions if you'd like, but it won't benefit you if you're so adamant about unfounded claims regarding blockchains. 

&gt;So let me ask, how would blockchain meaningfully improve my job in the food supply chain? 

I already answered this question. Here: 

&gt;They simply have better traceability to detect food health problems and such, at a cheaper cost (notably when investigating when problems arise), that's all.

You don't need a computer either, technically.

You're right. That's not the goal.

&gt;doesn't fix them, doesn't save any money. The logistics software we have now is far better, 

Would you mind to prove your claims, for once?

&gt;many major businesses don't want their activities on a public ledger

Care to tell how it's relevant? Many candle users didn't want to use light bulbs. So what? Dinosaurs are everywhere. It's ok, they'll simply be replaced. Like the ones who didn't want to use computers back then. 

&gt;Blockchains are slow, inefficient, and expensive things

You're still missing the point of the service. It's sad, but expected, knowing you. 

Besides, that's a whole lot of text to make a lot of claims so that you dodge a very simple proof by a *working business example*. 

I wonder when you will stop. Given your trajectory, I'd say you won't, even if faced with lots of business activities using them. 

You're just like some people, back then, when planes weren't yet working. Whatever's heavier than birds can't fly, they claimed. Some still claimed it even with planes flying. They just moved on to claim it will inevitably crash. Just like you'll move on to claim crypto will inevitably crash. People will use it, knowing it or not, for decades, and you'll still claim it will inevitably crash, oblivious to the fact it didn't crash and has proven to be at least way more stable than whatever it replaced. Just like them."	f30164532a8e9f5ad64d85a5e963077d0ac1b46c	True	False					0	1654039856		0	{}	iaq13w9	False	t3_v1mg97	False	True	t1_iapzj87	/r/ethereum/comments/v1mg97/why_supply_chains_and_blockchain_tech_are_the/iaq13w9/	1654039869	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

197	[]	False		LoganGyre			[]				text	t2_ckhh2	False	False	So here is why I’m getting bullish with this. My understanding is that 10% of eth is now locked into the 2.0 staking pools for the merge. These coins can’t be removed for 6 month after the merge. In those 6 months the price will begin to push higher as companies scramble to prepare for issuing the additional coins and be ready for people to cash out. While the cash out will dip the price I think overall it’s not unreasonable to be looking at 6-8k before then maybe even as high as 10-13k if more retail investors begin buying and holding on private wallets.	70212978b1b1aa7c5ad2a60c763de53bbfd1ef9c	True	False					0	1654033169		0	{}	iapmqj4	False	t3_v1r6q3	False	True	t3_v1r6q3	/r/ethereum/comments/v1r6q3/the_merge_is_coming_the_daily_gwei_491/iapmqj4/	1654033185	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

199	[]	False		theremote			[]				text	t2_4c225	False	False	"That's a fair take.  I know everyone is focused on Proof of Work's impending and looking toward Proof of Stake and I'm honestly trying to look at what is past that.  What is the evolution past proof of stake.

Proof of Stake isn't new at all to me although it will be to Ethereum.  Helium did proof of coverage and that is pretty interesting.  

I'm all for governance-types of solutions as one of my main complaints is that proof of stake is taking a huge amount of power out of the hands of the people and putting it in at best (and literally) a pool of validators who have 32 ETH.  

Your solution puts some more checks and balances back in that were just kind of ""lost"" in the Proof of Stake transition without any real thought put toward how is that still going to happen in the future.

Yes I know about microvalidating / validator pools, but the earnings are already bad for full validators and I'm certain I mine more ETH with 3 GPUs in a day then they will earn in a year microvalidating (it's down to about $11-$12 a day with 8 GPUs that I've had going since Nov 2020).

You need a \*lot\* of money to stake and make anything like what you can make with a few thousand bucks of GPUs.  That same few thousand bucks will take years if not decades to earn what was redistributed to average hardware in a day/week!"	e95ae3b713f166e1b9ec905fe0f6d2899617e7b4	True	False					0	1654032285		0	{}	iapks23	False	t3_v1mno7	False	True	t1_iapji9l	/r/ethereum/comments/v1mno7/i_feel_like_ethereums_scalability_issue_is/iapks23/	1654032299	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]
