In addition, they believe that the cost of buying coins is low, so they only need to pay the money to buy coins. But buying currency such as investing in stocks, the income is also big risk, you buy currency in the hand, the price of the currency rises you earn, the price of the currency falls you compensate. And the early need to do a lot of homework, which is similar to buying stocks, which requires you to understand the background of the investors all kinds of information, need to in-depth understanding of all kinds of basic information, according to their own cognition to make choices.  


In fact, you can invest Bitcoin quantitatively every day. You only need to invest once to obtain long-term returns. As long as your machine is up and running, it generates a certain amount of bitcoins every day, and the benefits are endless. Acquiring bitcoins this way does not require you to watch the price every day, wait for the price to rise later, and directly trade in cash. Relatively speaking, cloud mining is the lowest cost.

Hello. I need to talk to someone that knows why my withdrawal is still pending since august 8. It has been 16 days now without any explanation and no answers from support.

Ari

Hello Frank, thanks for joining the chat today

I'm happy to help with this, before we continue I will need to ask you a few security questions. To get started, can you please confirm your full name, Date of birth and the email address registered to your Blockchain Exchange account?

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------removed my personal information--------------------

Ari

Please allow me a few minutes to check your account

Thanks for waiting, Frank

The designated department is still working on your case. We kindly ask you for your patience and understanding. Once there is an update the team will contact you to your email

📷

I can’t believe that you are doing this to me. You are supposed to be [blockchain.com](http://blockchain.com/) “The most trusted exchange and crypto wallet”. A 14-billion-dollar company. And you are just taking all my money?

Ari

I understand the frustration this may cause. Please rest assured your funds are safe. The team must carry out security checks and protocols must be met. Every issue is different and requires different types of checks and time to be reviewed.

📷

I go to work every day, and almost all the money I make is going to pay interest on my loan. 

I am a family man with two small children. 2 and 4 years old. You are destroying our lives.

Ari

I´m sorry you are having this inconvenience, Frank. I do believe the best course of action at this moment will be to wait. I also understand that you may have not been notified of this, and that can generate stress and anxiety, but I can assure you your case is being worked by our internal team.

📷

I need to talk to someone that knows what is going on with my money! Why can’t I have my coins back? I need my money to pay my bills. 

Ari

Your transaction was flagged during our security checks and your case is currently under review by the appropriate team. Please note that I am unable to share more information on the nature of the check. At [Blockchain.com](http://blockchain.com/), we are dedicated to the trust and safety of our users and their funds and are required by law to treat these matters with the utmost urgency, so we appreciate your understanding. Our team will be working as swiftly as possible to review your case. During this time, you may be asked for additional information or documentation to help expedite this process, so please keep an eye on your email inbox for further communication from our team. There is no need to file additional tickets or follow-up chats as your case is already in queue. Once your case has been reviewed, you will be updated via email with the outcome and should a refund be required, this will be arranged for you. Thank you again for being a [Blockchain.com](http://blockchain.com/) customer, and for your patience as we review your case

A refund? This is my life savings we are talking about here, not some refund on a pack of gum. This is unbelievable.

Asha

Hi Frank 👋Thanks for reaching out! Could you please give me a bit more information/background on this? It will help me get a better understanding of your issue.

📷

I was talking to some other guy, but he left

Asha

Sorry to hear. Would you like to be reassigned to him?

📷

No, he wasn't helpful. My withdrawal is still pending since august 8. It has been 16 days now without any explanation and no answers from support.

And he starts talking about ""Maybe a can get a refund some day"".

I thought this was a supposed to be [blockchain.com](http://blockchain.com/) “The most trusted exchange and crypto wallet”. A 14-billion-dollar company.

and now you say that ""maybe a can get a refund some day""?

this is my life savings we are talking about

there shouldn't be any questions whether I should get my money back or not.

Asha

If your transaction raises a security flag, there's no shortcut to getting your funds unfortunately. You'd have to exercise patience for all security checks to be concluded. This could run through various departments before it is completed, depending on the case. I believe this is the situation with you. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, but we still need your patience to resolve this

📷

I have an account at Coinbase, [crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) and [binance.com](http://binance.com/). They have never done this to me.

the worst part is I don't have any clue about how long you are going to keep all my money?

and in the meantime, I have a huge loan in my bank that I must pay interest on every month, the interest is getting higher and higher. I am paying $1.400 every month to my bank on that loan. [Blockchain.com](http://blockchain.com/) is just loaning my money for free, without my consent, and without paying any interest for 16 days straight now.

Asha

I apologize for the inconvenience

📷

Is this a liquidity problem for [Blockchain.com](http://blockchain.com/)? Many people withdrawing at the same time? Then please tell me. I don’t need to withdraw all my coins at the same time, but I need some of my coins now to pay my bills. [Blockchain.com](http://blockchain.com/) is even blocking my small withdrawals. 

Asha

I will follow up with the concerned team regarding this

Hey Frank, I can see you've been away for a while now. This chat will close shortly, if we don't hear from you. If you still need help, feel free to reach out again!

📷

You didn't answer my last question

Asha

Your case is handled by a different department, they are in the best position to answer all your concerns.

📷

can I talk to them?

Asha

They will reach out to you via email and you can get to ask questins reagrding your case

📷

The support chat has been saying that to me for 16 days now

Nothing is happening

I check my email at least 10 times every day

Because my life is ruined because of this

Asha

I explained this earlier 'If your transaction raises a security flag, there's no shortcut to getting your funds unfortunately. You'd have to exercise patience for all security checks to be concluded. This could run through various departments before it is completed, depending on the case.'

📷

There should be no flags, I have been a customer since 2017, you have all my papers, you know who I am.

I've been taking money in and out of this exchange for 5 years without problems

And now suddenly there are red flags?

That doesn't make any sense

The only things that make sense is that [blockchain.com](http://blockchain.com/) does not have the liquidity

Asha

You will get your funds once this review have been completed

Sincere apologies for the inconvenience

Will reach out to the concerned team on your behalf.

📷

How long can I expect this ""review"" to last?

Asha

I can't provide you with a time frame as I cannot tell in advance when a resolution will be achieved, but rest assured that we are working hard to get this issue resolved as soon as possible.

📷

But how long does it normally take?

Are we talking days, weeks, months?

Asha

Each user's case is peculiar, I cannot promise what I am unsure of.

📷

You don't need to promise anything, I would just like to know how long this normally take? On average?

Asha

Our live chat support is meant for quick queries. Unfortunately, I cannot make guarantee on when your withdrawals will be completed. However, I can reach out to the team handling this, which I will proceed to do after this chat

📷

Do I have to get a lawyer?

Asha

Thank you for raising this issue. I will contact the department in question and ask for your case to be reviewed as soon as possible. Please accept our apologies for the inconvenience caused. Keep an eye out for your inbox - our team will reach out to you via e-mail as soon as possible!

In a Bear market, you will say: ""*What if this is still going down?*""

The price of Bitcoin has already fallen more than 70% from its ATH, but you are afraid to buy more BTC at a discount because you think the price might fall further. This is indeed a possibility, but the fact remains that the current price at 70% of ATH is already a huge opportunity. 

In a Bull market: ""*What if this is the top?*""

The price of Bitcoin keeps going up, but you suspect that it will reach a top in the market cycle. So you are afraid to accumulate more. You let months go by without accumulating any when for the next few years, Bitcoin is an accumulation game.

The key is to focus on the fundamentals of Bitcoin and ignore market cycles.

Because while the price of Bitcoin fluctuates with market cycles, the fundamentals of Bitcoin do not change, and it is clear that the price of Bitcoin will go much higher in the future as more and more people become aware of what Bitcoin is and why it is the future."

In a Bear market, you will say: ""*What if this is still going down?*""

The price of Bitcoin has already fallen more than 70% from its ATH, but you are afraid to buy more BTC at a discount because you think the price might fall further. This is indeed a possibility, but the fact remains that the current price at 70% of ATH is already a huge opportunity. 

In a Bull market: ""*What if this is the top?*""

The price of Bitcoin keeps going up, but you suspect that it will reach a top in the market cycle. So you are afraid to accumulate more. You let months go by without accumulating any when for the next few years, Bitcoin is an accumulation game.

The key is to focus on the fundamentals of Bitcoin and ignore market cycles.

Because while the price of Bitcoin fluctuates with market cycles, the fundamentals of Bitcoin do not change, and it is clear that the price of Bitcoin will go much higher in the future as more and more people become aware of what Bitcoin is and why it is the future."

Since this is a considerable size, I researched the fastest way to get the blockchain on my PC and in fact I didn't find a single piece of information that was relatively new. Even the official Bitcoin documentation still mentions around 200 GB and that it could take several weeks depending on the device.

Then I found another website that offers full node dumps to speed up the process:  
[https://blockchair.com/dumps#nodes](https://blockchair.com/dumps#nodes)  
The problem: The download is limited to 100 kbit/s, so the download takes more than a month.

I imagine there are enough other people asking the same question, which is why I'm writing this post.

Since I couldn't find any useful NEW info on the internet, and the blockchain dumps I found take too long to download, I took it into my own hands and played around with bitcoind's parameters.

My setup:  
OS: Fedora Linux 36  
CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 2700X  
Memory: 32GB  
External Disk: Samsung Portable SSD T7  
Bandwidth: max. 50 MBit/s (mobile internet)

My goal:  
To download the entire blockchain to the external SSD including creation of all available indices.

With this command I was able to download the entire blockchain in almost exactly 24 hours:

`bitcoind --datadir=&lt;path-to-external-ssd&gt; -blockfilterindex=1 -txindex=1 -coinstatsindex=1 -dbcache=16384 -daemon`

Of course, the command and the resulting performance only refers to my setup. You'll definitely need to adjust the -dbcache parameter if you don't have 32GB of RAM available. The -dbcache parameter is set in MB and can be between 4 and 16384.  
After downloading the blockchain, you can set the parameter back to the default value by simply removing the parameter.  
Furthermore, you will definitely get even better performance if you remove the index parameters - if you don't need them for any development purposes, feel free to remove the parameters from the command.

Finally, an explanation of my used parameters for completeness:  
**-datadir=**&lt;dir&gt;  
*Specify data directory. This specifies the whole "".bitcoin"" data directory, so if you e.g just want to have the ""blocks"" subdir on a different location, you have to use -blocksdir. There are a few more dirs to set if you want, just look in the --help of bitcoind*

**-blockfilterindex=**&lt;type&gt;  
*Maintain an index of compact filters by block (default: 0, values: basic). If &lt;type&gt; is not supplied or if &lt;type&gt; = 1, indexes for all known types are enabled.* 

**-txindex**  
*Maintain a full transaction index, used by the getrawtransaction rpc call (default: 0)* 

**-coinstatsindex**  
*Maintain coinstats index used by the gettxoutsetinfo RPC (default: 0)* 

**-dbcache=**&lt;n&gt;  
*Maximum database cache size &lt;n&gt; MiB (4 to 16384, default: 450). In addition, unused mempool memory is shared for this cache (see* ***-maxmempool****).* 

**-daemon**  
*Run in the background as a daemon and accept commands (default: 0). If you run it as a daemon, you can check the progress in the debug.log in the .bitcoind dir.*

The main reason this happened is because of us, not crypto itself. We let centralized exchanges take over the entire crypto space. What do you expect to happen when an American centralized exchange like Coinbase or Binance US have everyone’s private information and facial ID?

What do you expect to happen when we rely on Tether or Circle for our stablecoins instead of something like MakerDAO’s DAI?

We are all a part of the problem. What we are in right now isn’t a crypto market because it’s centralized asf.

What we’re doing goes against everything that crypto stands for in the first place.

What happened to the days where DeFi was king?

Don’t get me wrong, DeFi TVL is still higher than that on CEX and we’re still seeing a lot of development in the DeFi world

AAVE will soon drop their own algo stablecoin similar to that of DAI.  
Bitdao already has $1.5 billion worth of assets in its treasury treasury and will soon launch its own L1  
Curve voted on adding even more liquidity to their pools (which is great because that would boost algo stablecoins even more).

But all of that alone still doesn’t matter when the other half of crypto is still run by centralized exchanges.   
Yes, DeFi TVL is higher but you can’t ignore how huge CeFi TVL is as well. People aren’t willing to lose this much money.

If we’d all use DEXs, DAOs and other DeFi tools, we wouldn’t care less about what the US government says because they can’t reach us. But when USDC, USDT, Coinbase, Binance US and many more crypto companies are US law abiding companies then it’s a big deal.

So bottom line, stop blaming crypto and DeFi. The fundamentals are still there. Start blaming the people that made the crypto space regulatory compliant. This is the reason why the US has such a huge effect on the crypto market that was supposed to be decentralized and only answers to the community in the first place."

So basically it all starts from here :-  

1. India being a developing country it doesn't want INR to be converted to USD by any means. 

2. India has UPI a unified payment interface which is made by central banks and other banks together. Which every month does the transaction equivalent of 20% of India's annual budget every month and almost everyone has a UPI app in their phone. That too for free. And since trackable by banks so it is always preferred by banks to let people use UPI rather than crypto which they can't track or control sometimes.

3. India have applied 30% tax on all crypto profit and 1% tds on every transaction.

So now keep in mind above points.

Now the real story begins, India is having huge demand for crypto so huge that arbitrage of buying crypto in India is as high as 5-6% from CMP. Now you might be thinking why? So the thing is that to get crypto in India you need to get it from exchanges or p2p or mine the crypto apart from this there is no possibile way to get crypto in India for a regular Joe in exchange of INR.
 I went through the depth and found out that the reason why people are paying 5-6% of premium for buying crypto is just because they cannot buy crypto directly from exchanges  .
All banks have stopped direct deposits to crypto exchanges as banks won't allow it and won't want it because of point 1&amp;2 , so the only way out is p2p. 

Now since it is said so we have tons of people buying crypto right? No! Actual demand that was shown by exchanges and charged premium saying demand is high is false. I saw myself on wazirx (biggest platform in India) there were trades on Bitcoin after 15 mins of intervals , volume was so less. 

So people who are supplying crypto are just making huge cut out of nowhere .
Indian banks will never support crypto and won't allow direct transfer from banks to exchanges because they have UPI for transactions that they created and they control. So therefore Indians will keep paying premium to get into crypto .

Here is good news, india central bank is thinking to charge fee of $0.24 per transaction of $10 in INR for UPI transaction as maintaining UPI was costly for banks now . So as we know many blockchain need much less fees for transaction maybe UPI will be over thrown and crypto will win."

Independent of the state of the economy, there will always be a demand for gaming. The industry's attempt to switch from a play-to-earn paradigm to a play-and-earn approach is among the topics now being explored.
