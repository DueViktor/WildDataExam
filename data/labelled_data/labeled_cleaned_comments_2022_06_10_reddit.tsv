Bitcoin in its speculative/asset phase (where it is predominantly hodl'd and not as much used as a MoE) may see its value go up up up and then crash, sure.  But since Bitcoin is also a medium of exchange, a crash won't kill it at all.  It will continue existing.  And it will eventually become a currency, once hodling has less chance for massive gains (e.g. when yearly average appreciation goes down to say 5% against the dollar).

For people who **only** see it as an asset, a majority (51%+) will probably be screwed, as they'll buy high and sell low when their time preferences / daily needs force a sell during a dip.  If you're on this subreddit, hopefully you're in the minority who have the ability to wait out dips.   
 The companies and mill/billionaires investing will too.

That's unfortunate, but hey, Bitcoin is not a true asset.  You don't live in it, you don't hang it on the wall or put it in a humidity-controlled garage.  It is only meaningful because of the network, and the network exists to *transact*.

For people who see Bitcoin as a **future currency**, these crashes are next to meaningless.  Worst case you think ""I could have bought in at 50% discount and had more for later"".  You are not waiting for a dollar value to sell.  You are waiting (if at all) for goods and services to be transacted in Bitcoin in your area."	744133b6575102e2723bbe4ad09abfb52bd50de8	True	False					0	1654746341		0	{}	iboyjoa	False	t3_v822cm	False	False	t3_v822cm	/r/Bitcoin/comments/v822cm/could_it_be_a_bubble/iboyjoa/	1654746351	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]		True

Here's a definition of theft from the encyclopedia Britannica: ""Theft is defined as the physical removal of an object that is capable of being stolen without the consent of the owner and with the intention of depriving the owner of it permanently.""

Setting aside the part about ""physical removal"", you are suggesting that central banks are intentionally taking your money away from you for the express purpose of permanently depriving you of wealth? If you honestly believe that monetary policy's actual goal is to deprive citizens (and the government) of wealth just to inflict harm, that explains a lot of why we seem to be talking past each other.

I don't think harm is the intention, even if it is sometimes the outcome.

&gt; You want intellectual honesty? Make it tax instead of inflation, call it ""tax for stimulating economy"", and let's see just how high you can hike that before you get trouble.

That's not what intellectual honesty means. I was specifically referring to the use of loaded language in an attempt to mislead about the true nature of the topic under discussion. But, yes, of course if inflation were manufactured and tightly controlled by the central bank, it would be perfectly valid to consider targetting 0% inflation and then implementing a 2% wealth tax. I doubt this would have the same impact, as after that 2% is taken, there is less incentive for the rich to ""guard"" the rest by, e.g., hiring people.

&gt; To clear up details: the opposite of theft isn't welfare; it's playing it straight.

I disagree. The opposite of taking is giving. Giving free money to people is welfare. And deflation gives you free money in precisely the same way that inflation takes it away. It doesn't matter if only those who already have money are eligible for the free money -- it's still welfare. And it'll take more than an assertion to the contrary to convince me otherwise.

&gt; On deflation - you are talking deflation through removing money from the existing supply; but with Bitcoin, it's largely just not adding to the supply.

No, I am not. To a first approximation, I am talking about not maintaining a constant supply *per capita*. But even that is a rather gross misrepresentation of what I am saying.

&gt; Assuming full adoption by the time deflation/supply cap is happening, the only reason you'd get to buy more for same amount of sats would be progress in productivity and tech, which sounds pretty nice to me.

Unless you believe in supply and demand. There can be at most 2100000000000000 sats, ever. If they all existed now and we split them evenly among every human on earth, that'd be about 270,000 sats per person on Earth.

Now suppose BTC/sats is the one and only currency. If Earth's population doubled to 15 billion, there'd only be 135,000 sats per person. Since there ""the only reason you'd get more for the same amount of sats would be progress in productivity and tech"", absent such progress you seem to be saying that each human would only be able to get half as much. Because the limited supply would remain blissfully agnostic to the drastically increased demand?

&gt; It's also not % off the monthly paycheck, as you say; it's off anything that's cash/currency and not stashed away (if you can afford the fees and taxes to keep converting currency back and forth).

How does converting currencies help? The only reliable way to guard from inflation is to put your money to productive use. Lend it so somebody who has a business venture you believe in; start a restaurant and hire some people to work in it; buy raw materials and turn them into something more valuable to sell; etc.

&gt; And, it doesn't matter what the central bankers' target is; I'm evaluating their results, not their targets, because if they are unable to hit in proximity of their targets, what do we need them for?

We get some pretty brutal forest fires around here. We have people dedicated to forest management and fighting forest fires (in my undergrad days, I used to work on the forest fire simulation software they use to model fires and deploy resources). Yet, try as they may, some years the fires go nuts. Sometimes a bunch of people die. Sometimes entire towns burn to the ground. If the forest fire people cannot always keep fires in check, what do we need them for?

In a similar vein, there has been a huge spike in opioid deaths around here. Seems as though safe injection sites and addictions counselling isn't fully solving the problem, so why do we have it?

&gt; So 8% is likely off, but so is 0.67%, and really either would be a tough sell as tax on everything.

Indeed 0.67% month over month is equivalent to 8% year over year, so they are either both correct or both incorrect. My point was merely that your example was consistent with a 15% inflation rate, not the 8% you stated.

&gt; Christine Lagarde is the President of the ECB, and recently featured on this sub refusing to give a sensible answer to the simple question of why she's screwing millions of people and when she'll stop.

Ah, I missed that one. FWIW, if the question was worded like you just worded it, then I would say that telling the asker to kindly go fuck themselves would be an appropriate response.

If the question was worded more sensibly, then I can only conjecture why a substantive answer was not forthcoming. In my country, something like 60% of ""excess inflation"" (i.e., inflation beyond the target of 2%) is due to oil &amp; gas prices and food prices. Short of assassinating Putin, what can a central banker do about that? For the other 40%, they can raise  interest rates to neutral or higher. (Does that count as theft? In this case, somebody literally takes your money and keeps if for themselves.)

&gt; Whether she's targeting 0% or 2%, she's missing her target by a wide gap. And I mean, it's a tough job and people screw up, just what happens. But if my dentist or developer or cleaner screwed up AND refused to explain themselves, they'd be out of job. For Lagarde, not a problem.

Agreed. But next time you go to the dentist, ask him how many more cavities you will have in your lifetime. I bet he'll say something weaselly like ""according to our current understanding of dentistry, if you brush twice a day with a fluoridated toothpaste and floss regularly, you shouldn't have too many more cavities. But I really can't say for sure."" Then stick to your principles and fire his ass."	3911ef6a80f654dc9402b2f0a4cfe6f00b4e3240	True	False					0	1654742301		0	{}	iboqvhw	False	t3_v64unp	False	True	t1_ibo1sm0	/r/Bitcoin/comments/v64unp/this_is_why_we_need_bitcoin_the_government_in/iboqvhw/	1654742312	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]

To be fair, I actually disagree with the statement ""there is no encryption in bitcoin"", Bitcoin does in fact use elliptic curve cryptography to sign messages, and the message signatures are \*technically\* an encrypted hash of the message, though this is not really the use case people typically think of when they use the term ""encryption"" so I can see where u/SmoothGoing is coming from.

I would agree that bitcoin is ""protected and defended with encryption"" in a technical sense, I just disagree that SHA256 is that encryption, because it is not. ""Encryption"" and ""hashing"" are both terms of art with specific and distinct definitions and we should use these terms correctly because cryptocurrency is already confusing enough as it is without misuse of terminology."	f755a75a810690a2029fad59e3671cf223aae9ff	True	False					0	1654741029		0	{}	ibooehw	False	t3_v81fdu	False	True	t1_ibohqzi	/r/Bitcoin/comments/v81fdu/interesting_pov/ibooehw/	1654741042	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]

&gt;lol no, I believe ETH will do things such as smart contracts between countries where fees don’t matter and security is of high priority , where SOL will do things such as stock exchanges where people want the lowest cost per transaction.

&gt;Each has their use cases. I’m bullish on both, and bag both.

Since it's centralized, actually, it's just like the stockmarket, as it can be coerced and regulated just as much as the stockmarket. But then, the stockmarket already exists, you can already use it. 

That's why you will never have big money flock to Solana (at least as long as it can't prove it's decentralized and uncensorable): don't imagine many people with millions will accept to lose their funds just because some coercive group decided to shut down the chain (be it the devs or anyone who can coerce the few of them). It's too high of a risk for such amounts of money. When they can already use the stockmarket? What's the use for? 

Sure, you'll always have dumb investors with a high risk profile even with big money, but the risk is high enough for most investors to keep it at bay."	c9f3080b29adce900f167e18f6ebc329b213e4f8	True	False					0	1654817900		0	{}	ibskpg6	False	t3_v8jgei	False	True	t3_v8jgei	/r/ethereum/comments/v8jgei/regular_outages_in_solana_is_why_it_receives_bad/ibskpg6/	1654817911	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

If someone were arguing to you that we should just use Microsoft Excel spreadsheets for real estate transactions to solve the housing crisis because our system is messed up, you'd feel like you were talking to a madman right? Cuz that's how I feel at the moment. Let's use a decentralized append only database. That will somehow fix enormous concentrations of wealth???

Here a lending pool could choose to give you a better rate than a bank, with better terms, to get your business. 

Why?

Because the interest generated on the loan is now paid back to us, the human lenders, as direct income and we have cut out the banks by becoming the lending institution.

We can generate the interest on loans, as individuals, through the power of shared lending pools, and we do it without intermediaries taking massive cuts.

Will they take a cut? To do the regulation dance and the trust thing… sure. But it forces competition, and empowers us as individuals to lend instead of paying it all back to banks who give us unfavorable terms, get bailouts, and never pay for their misbehavior.

But what I do know , is that our current real estate system has many many areas that are extremely inefficient and that just maybe, it may be worth looking into how NFT ownership could assist. It's clear there is a good use case on the Blockchain, it's why crypto is still a thing after 10 years- everyone is just scrambling to understand how it can be in service and be implemented correctly. 

Today's US housing market is a prime example of how this system is failing. Large corporate entities like black rock, Goldman Sachs, citadel have legally decided they can wipe out the entire housing market in the 100-500k range creating an entire nation of renters who don't own any single thing, because they purchased every single mid range single family own and many of those properties will ever enter the market again, most likely many will sit vacant as well. It makes perfect sense for them as well- real estate is and will likely always be a primary way to invest capital for the entities that have billions or even trillions in assets to do so with and provide them with significant equitable returns and more importantly, power over the non existent middle class. It's within their legal ability to do so.

Right now, you have a indexing system operated by people that basically stores information about local real estate.

The improvements on the land (the actual building) don't even have their own recording system; they're affixed to the land so they go wherever it goes.

Deeds are just pieces of paper saying X passes title in this land to Y. Title work is just an aggregation of data about land that includes encumbrances on that title. Even mortgages are just data: it's just a recording of an agreement share title. It's all data.

I've actually talked with the devs of Solrarity and other similar tools (like NFTSoloist) - you can actually stream those NFTs as they get listed/delisted/sold straight from the chain. AFAIK both Solrarity and NFTSoloist are streaming events to you straight from the chain, which is why you see these events before the front-end of Magic Eden updates via their API.  


On-chain monitoring is extremely powerful for this type of data, and SolanaFloor does a great job of streaming and aggregating this activity across all marketplaces.

Then you may want to get on Twitter and debunk this ""FUD"". It has to be the most damning report I've ever seen regarding Solana and I wish I hadn't found it as I was a steady investor who first found SOL around $4.40. 

Given the fact they review all blockchains, one can't say they're attacking just SOL for some nefarious reason but if they are I'm happy to see the hard evidence.

Your take on this snippet of their report?

Are there scams?  Yes.  Are there projects that go up 5000% after mint?  Yes.  And with the joy of Solana you don't have to worry about losing $1000 to gas and not even getting your transaction processed.

Regulation is coming right now it's the wild west so you have to be very cautious.  Degods was a 2 SOL mint or so and it's worth over 300.. Okay Bears same explosive growth with more volume than the majority of ETH projects etc.

Solana has been killing it.. even Opensea has opened up their marketplace to Solana.  

There are already companies that do their best to vet projects.. as well as communities that un-rug some of the projects.  Clearly it's still extremely risky.

I'd rather be on Solana after a year of fixing these bugs than Eth L2 during it's first year experiencing them.

* handle 85+ Gb/second inbound traffic
* recover from halts with zero data loss
* halt itself in fundamentally impossible scenarios to prevent malicious exploits
* agree on 2/3 weighted consensus within seconds
* handle over 50% of all of the world's cryptocurrency transactions
* allows smart contracts or ""user programs"" to be built that execute anything possible within the bounds of the platform
* stay online without forcing endpoint nodes to update to latest software versions unless 95% of nodes agree it's required

OP, have your managers ever told you that 200k users will be on your system before you can finish your QA tests and pre-release checks?

Solana does not have a perfect test environment to run in, as the on-chain activity is constantly evolving and adjusting to new smart contracts (user programs) and changes in activity distribution. There isn't a chain in existence that has solved problems at this level - there is literally no roadmap or testcase.

If you want a chain building the ""perfect chain"" and entirely missing user adoption or ecosystem momentum, check out Cardano.
