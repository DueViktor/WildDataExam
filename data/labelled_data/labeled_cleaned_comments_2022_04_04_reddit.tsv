In that case, and assuming none of these algorithms counteract each other, the algorithms used act sort of like a password. Except that instead of an alphabet of 36 or more characters, your alphabet is limited to common reversible encryption algorithms. Say there are 10 such algorithms you've mentioned so far. So even if you apply a random 6 of them, it's like a 6 digit PIN code, and there are only 10 \^ 6, or a million possible combinations. It's relatively easy to brute force them all.

You'd need a large alphabet of encryption algorithms and lots of them strung together to make enough entropy to match a secure password. And in that case, you have three key disadvantages over simply using a secure password as your key:

* It's really hard to remember which algorithms and their order.
* Some of those algorithms might counteract each other, in ways that could make your secret easier to decode.
* You either have to do this by hand (tons of work) or implement it in code somewhere (someone can find it).

Generally cryptographic algorithms are put together by extremely smart people, and are designed so that the key is the only secret. Your BIP39 seed phrase is already a key, and you can add a 25th word as a password to add even more entropy. If you want even more entropy than that, then focus on making that 25th word even harder to crack. That's easy to do simply by making it longer with something else at the end. If you want to type the names of the algorithms at the end, ironically that should add just as much entropy if someone knows the scheme, and even more if they don't. And you don't have to do any extra work except typing just a bit more to access the funds.

But usually, this isn't the attack vector which gets people. It's more likely one of the following:

* A fraudulent scam investment or platform.
* Someone tricked you into using a fraudulent wallet.
* A smart contract hack where the funds were stored.
* Signing a malicious transaction.
* You lost your access to your wallet and the backup.

In my experience that is a problem when competing in an international software environment. I am german in enginnering with strong software interfaces. I have worked for major Dax companies and in my experience Germanys culture has evolved around conservative mechanical engineering which is opposing the rather fast progressive  mindset of software development. Each has an advantages in its context but hinders each other when having to work together. I really wonder if competitive german software companies can survive when the hole system focuses on conservative technologies eg. automotive. I wonder how they have survived so long and I have not heard of them as they seem to be quite a solid dev team. Another thing Germans tend to underestimate is PR where eg.

Which means that right now some non-zero amount of real estate is being traded for bitcoin directly. This is literally real estate being demonetized in favor of monetizing bitcoin as a SoV. To what extent redfin didn’t quantify and I imagine it’s a niche occurrence now but I think it’s an emerging trend that’s going to intensify over the coming decade. 

This trade really does make sense for those heavily weighted in real estate as a SoV. Holding bitcoin is zero cost, no entropy and 100% secure. Holding real estate is expensive and real estate is subject to some regulatory and legal uncertainty (eminent domain, changing tax structures, political uncertainly, etc).

I wouldn't follow any network that implements that, because it's a huge red flag of theft.

Seamless. One second your wallet is connected to the PoW network, the next it's connected to the PoS network.

&gt; Will you have both old and new ETH in your wallet?

It's less that you'll have old and new ETH in your wallet, more that there will be two entire separate Ethereum networks for the briefest of moments. Your ETH exists in both networks at the same time, as both networks originated from the same history, but you'll only see one network, as your wallet will (hopefully) seamlessly switch from the old network to the new network.

&gt; If a few people keep the old fork running, does your ETH hold value in both forks?

The new network's ETH will hold the same value as before, as exchanges will also be seamlessly switching from the old network to the new network, but the old network's ETH will start losing value, as it's not listed on exchanges (yet, it may be listed if the old network survives the fork), and so nobody's trading it.

The same thing happened to ETC, which itself was born of a fork: the network hard forked, creating two separate versions; exchanges followed the new version, so the ETH listing updated to the new version, meanwhile the old version wasn't listed and so the price started to plummet; the old version was listed again under ETC, but by the time it was listed, the damage was done and it was a fraction of the price of ETH.

Since then, ETC has been following its own pricing trajectory, as for all intents and purposes, it's a different coin to ETH, following the fork. If the PoW network survives the merge and miners/users get it listed on exchanges, then it'll likely go through the same process as ETC.

&gt; What if it does, can you still sell it?

If it gets listed on exchanges, yes. As said above, though, its price *will* diverge from ETH, so you may not make as much money selling it as you'd think/hope. Until it gets listed on exchanges, then you can only sell it P2P: directly trading it for some other coin or fiat with somebody else.

&gt; Do you have to make a new wallet?

Assuming it survives the fork, then your wallet software would just need to be updated to list it as a new coin, and point to the old network. It *is* Ethereum at its core, it's just a version of Ethereum that took a different trajectory than the main Ethereum network, so your wallet will support it easily, and you'll even be able to keep the same address."	985eb7cf1a7b98c1e3eb284d3e6575e01826ba0e	True	False					0	1648952550		0	{}	i36bqdt	False	t3_tuv8yd	False	True	t1_i368ty0	/r/ethereum/comments/tuv8yd/how_will_we_see_that_the_merge_has_started_and/i36bqdt/	1648952561	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]				 gt like do current eth holders have to do anything with their eth for it to be valid on the new chain or is everything seamless seamless one second your wallet is connected to the pow network the next it s connected to the pos network gt will you have both old and new eth in your wallet it s less that you ll have old and new eth in your wallet more that there will be two entire separate ethereum networks for the briefest of moments your eth exists in both networks at the same time as both networks originated from the same history but you ll only see one network as your wallet will hopefully seamlessly switch from the old network to the new network gt if a few people keep the old fork running does your eth hold value in both forks the new network s eth will hold the same value as before as exchanges will also be seamlessly switching from the old network to the new network but the old network s eth will start losing value as it s not listed on exchanges yet it may be listed if the old network survives the fork and so nobody s trading it the same thing happened to etc which itself was born of a fork the network hard forked creating two separate versions exchanges followed the new version so the eth listing updated to the new version meanwhile the old version wasn t listed and so the price started to plummet the old version was listed again under etc but by the time it was listed the damage was done and it was a fraction of the price of eth since then etc has been following its own pricing trajectory as for all intents and purposes it s a different coin to eth following the fork if the pow network survives the merge and miners users get it listed on exchanges then it ll likely go through the same process as etc gt what if it does can you still sell it if it gets listed on exchanges yes as said above though its price will diverge from eth so you may not make as much money selling it as you d think hope until it gets listed on exchanges then you can only sell it p2p directly trading it for some other coin or fiat with somebody else gt do you have to make a new wallet assuming it survives the fork then your wallet software would just need to be updated to list it as a new coin and point to the old network it is ethereum at its core it s just a version of ethereum that took a different trajectory than the main ethereum network so your wallet will support it easily and you ll even be able to keep the same address 	0.0029809661209583282	0.9884215593338013	0.03232728689908981	0.045370131731033325	0.008542940951883793	0.40612155199050903	0.06991645693778992	8.488160005981626e-07	0.23700231313705444	0.03671198710799217

In decentralization, anyone can choose whatever chain they want and fork however they want. That's what happened. 

You're the one thinking about it backwards. If a majority or a minority could prevent any other majority or minority from forking, then it would be centralized.

First, AVAX isn't PoS. It's dPoS. It's known dPoS is way less decentralized than PoS. That's a huge part of how they can achieve their 4.5k TPS. 

The other reason of their 4.5k TPS is their hardware requirements to launch a validator. Have you seen these hardware requirements? No wonder they're having only ~1.4k validators. 

And even with all these sacrifices they made, they couldn't be more scalable than Ethereum and the solutions of L2s it uses. Ethereum handles ~55 TPS and L2s can already provide more than 5.5k TPS. 

And you expect this chain to compete? They'll need rollups. They're using subnets, but the fact they aren't compressing the data means they're lacking on huge improvements of their scalability.

But some of my friends love it but are chasing other investment and are hoping they will be aible to buy xrp before it blows up. So for short term gains many go for other alt coins. While i just have 90% of my portfolio in xrp and dont have to stress or think about the prices. Ive done so much research on xrp and the ripple team that i dont even care if it fails. There are just a couple of times in my life when I was conviced that a company would be huge. Tesla, amazon, alibaba, Google and Facebook.
