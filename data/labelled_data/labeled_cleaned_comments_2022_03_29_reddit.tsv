As I said, I don't think it exists a single member that straight-up refuses to comply with some regulation.

Until you have a lot, the best BTC strategy is to simply HODL, and push savings into bitcoin.

Even if you have a whole BTC, a better strategy than trying to trade it (Which in itself has plenty of risk) is to utilise that time and energy to work at what you're good at, and buy more.

If you go by the numbers, 100% of holders are killing it after 5 years, whereas 90% of traders are bust after 5 years. It's not easy to trade, otherwise everyone would do it.

Top selling is relatively easy too some of the time, but if you look at on chain analytics for example, even sophisticated traders get it wrong. On the run up in 2020, through the 15k-30k portion of the USD price range, huge amounts of Btc was distributed by long term holders. People who should know better. They sold with the idea they would buy back on the dip.

We never and probably won't ever again, revisited those prices.

So that's an example of people who traded BTC for years and years, and still got it wrong.

If your goal is to accumulate, then accumulate. Use bitcoin like a savings account. Park spare money into it. When there are vicious dips, consider picking up overtime, and you've essentially found an awesome hack to leverage your hard work."	abc97f1e1589597b12eee0cb36fc647cc295246a	True	False					0	1648453016		0	{}	i2evasj	False	t3_tq2zma	False	True	t3_tq2zma	/r/Bitcoin/comments/tq2zma/discussion_investment_strategy_hodl_staking_defi/i2evasj/	1648453032	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]

SOL will see it's gains from the success of the Solana platform and ecosystem. It was never really designed to be the ideal currency.

Nano and Solana are quite different and could co-exist nicely. If Solana is a superior Ethereum, Nano is designed to be a superior Bitcoin. Its a deflationary digi-cash, fairly distribution, decentralised, energy efficient, instant, feeless. 

Reasons it's so low currently 
1. It's it's being suppressed by major exchanges.
2. People believe for crypto to succeed Bitcoin needs to lead the charge. Nano could cause mixed messages, leading to slower adoption.
3. It doesn't offer rewards. (High rewards usually mean highly inflationary and are only used as incentive)
4. Doesn't fit with today's lust for layer 1 smart contract platforms. (Useful but not needed for digi-cash)
5. Uses block lattice (DAG + Blockchain) rather than blockchain which is a feature but it just need more validation just like PoH to validate it's success.

I'm bullish on Solana as an ecosystem for dApps and information transmission, what it was designed for. 

XNO is technically design to be digital cash and it does that better then SOL ever could in my opinion.


p.s Nano has made solid process on the spam prevention. Its just a matter of time until people realise crypto has numerous categories, some day people will realise they prefer to send 100 then receive 100 not 99.999 or less."	36d06a2163ce93338a16414b7f028a15055dc31f	True	False					0	1648454388		0	{}	i2ewvf2	False	t3_tq1a82	False	True	t1_i2eqymt	/r/solana/comments/tq1a82/i_bought_chairs_paid_by_solana_and_now_im_so/i2ewvf2/	1648454404	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]

I’d you are looking to HODL long term, don’t want to take on extra risk, and want to set it and forget it there’s no better option then native staking with a validator. 

As far as picking a validator, I’d recommend checking out stakewiz.com to get a ranked list of validators based on a number of metrics combined into one. You can still sort by pure apy if you’d like. Other good options are stakeview.app and solanacompass.com

Are you an advanced crypto user and looking to go full degen and jump straight into defi? I’d recommend using marinade and their liquid staking token. For some ideas on what you can do in defi to take extra risk but earn more rewards you can check out this guide I wrote in exactly that. https://medium.com/@Cogent_Crypto/solana-staking-guide-part-2-advance-staking-strategies-335337b77ec9

Also there are Block rewards. You get them if you are in the leader schedule. This schedule is calculated based on your stake.
