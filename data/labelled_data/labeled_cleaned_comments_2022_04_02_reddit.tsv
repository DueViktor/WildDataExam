ETH going offline would presumably cause the price of ETH to tumble - when restarted at a lower price, many positions would be instantly liquidated without anyone having the opportunity to top off or close positions before that happened.

But wouldn't the owner of the position *also* have the opportunity to top off or close out before someone can liquidate them?  How is that any different than if a sudden drop happened in the matter of seconds?  To the contracts on the chain, it's all the same, right?

I guess the only exception to that would be things that try to use the timestamps in the block.

&gt; The state on the chain is going to be significantly out of sync with the state of the real world when it spins back up - that has ramifications for nearly all of DeFi, and that can cause unpredictable second order consequences. I would not be surprised if many contracts break as a result.

Can't people just decide in a *decentralized* fashion to just... not reintroduce real-world state back onto the chain immediately? /s

&gt; And that's assuming it's a clean freeze. If there's a fork and there needs to be a rollback, that's far worse because no matter what block gets chosen, it's going to screw a lot of people. Even rolling back a minute (4 blocks) would undo tons of real world transactions and trades that were presumed valid.

But that can happen anyway, even under PoS, to any block that hasn't achieved finality, right?"	615b090ae55ca95331e4fdb9e811bdc8584d8e3d	True	False					0	1648793368		0	{}	i2y9gdi	False	t3_tt34gb	False	True	t1_i2xobci	/r/ethereum/comments/tt34gb/looking_for_input_from_the_community_regarding/i2y9gdi/	1648793381	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

As seen from the other comments, some people (some would argue that ""most people"") do not think for themselves and are just followers repeating the popular opinions. This kind of people are the ones that fooled others into their scamcoin because they form the majority (not calling eth one, however its still a failcoin as time will tell).

Bear with me:

Knowledge in the real sense of the word is Applied Theory. Vitalik (and anyone under a certain age) is very smart when it comes to Theory and that alone gives away the fact that he lacks the Applied part.  
 
This is true for most of reddit whom although you're all know it alls you can barely do your own shopping because /r/outside is not at all like you've read on the internet. 
 
Money is no joke, money has shaped the world. To think a piece of code solves a life long problem is nothing but naive, its actually just get rich quick wishful thinking. 
 
All regulations coming down will slap most alts out of existence. Bitcoin has not succeeded yet but at least its sewer rat attitude gives it better odds.
