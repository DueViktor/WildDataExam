If you earn $1,000 worth of staking rewards, that’s equivalent to $1,000 income and you owe taxes on $1,000 income.

But when you sell it, $1,000 is your cost basis. So if you sell to USD right after receipt you pay no additional taxes because your cost basis is the same as your sale price.

If you hold and your rewards moon and your rewards are worth $10,000 and then you sell, you owe capital gains taxes on the $9,000 profit.  

If your rewards crash to $100 and then you sell, you can claim $900 loss as a capital loss and deduct it from your taxes.  

Where it can screw you is if you earn $10,000 one year, and the next year it crashes.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

The rest of what we here on these networks is right-wing, pro corporate propaganda, regardless of if they favor dems or not.

Not all games are made in the same way. A skin from one game is coded and program in a specific fashion in a specific engine. So trying to go between different games with different engines would have to involve some sort of universal engine or interpreter. Not to mention potential legal issues due to copy right.

Of course we don’t know the future. But it’s legitimate to argue, let’s say, a cyclist that drives 40km/h and 2 meters in front of him is a cliff, will fall over that cliff. We can’t predict the future, but we can deduct in some instances with higher certainty and in others with lesser certainty what is more or less possible to happen.

If you are comparing Solana’s decentralization to Ethereum, then yes Solana is LESS decentralized. 

But saying that Solana has NO DECENTRALIZATION is a baseless claim with zero accuracy.

The Nakamoto coefficient has steadily increasing since inception, the amount of Validators has steadily increased as well, these are all variables to measure a blockchains decentralization. 

Decentralization is measurable and takes time. It’s not an on/off switch. Compare Solana’s current state to 2016/2017 Ethereum if you want an accurate comparison. 

Solana was launched in March 2020, while Ethereum has been around since 2014. Of course Ethereum will have a more robust and developed infrastructure… that’s basic common sense.

As to why it is useful? I would do some basic research in to the innovative improvements Solana has developed.

Try building Solana Pay or Zebec Protocol on Ethereum and let me know how it goes. 

There are these things called trade offs one must consider when developing their product. Some developers prefer the best UX for their audience and aren’t as worried about 100% decentralized, which is perfectly fine. 

Not everything needs to be 100% decentralized. The same way things don’t need to be 100% centralized, it’s an equal balance between both forces."	15abef77dbe0dab9a4313529d23ca31a4bb37032	True	False					0	1647701745		0	{}	i1abged	False	t3_thrfub	False	True	t1_i19yp13	/r/solana/comments/thrfub/on_solana_i_think_the_best_retail_focused_dapp_is/i1abged/	1647701764	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]		really if you are comparing solana s decentralization to ethereum then yes solana is less decentralized but saying that solana has no decentralization is a baseless claim with zero accuracy the nakamoto coefficient has steadily increasing since inception the amount of validators has steadily increased as well these are all variables to measure a blockchains decentralization decentralization is measurable and takes time it s not an on off switch compare solana s current state to 2016 2017 ethereum if you want an accurate comparison solana was launched in march 2020 while ethereum has been around since 2014 of course ethereum will have a more robust and developed infrastructure that s basic common sense as to why it is useful i would do some basic research in to the innovative improvements solana has developed try building solana pay or zebec protocol on ethereum and let me know how it goes there are these things called trade offs one must consider when developing their product some developers prefer the best ux for their audience and aren t as worried about 100 decentralized which is perfectly fine not everything needs to be 100 decentralized the same way things don t need to be 100 centralized it s an equal balance between both forces 	0.002672472270205617	0.9883967041969299	0.1712663769721985	0.051200006157159805	0.9943918585777283	0.3027431070804596	0.08807611465454102	8.557850037504977e-07	0.5546150207519531	0.05907797813415527
