Staking in Solana is the process delegating sol to a validator, which helps increase those validators’ voting weight. Validators process new incoming transactions on the network, as well as for voting on and appending new blocks to the blockchain. The more stake is delegated to them, the more they can vote on ergo the more stake the better. 

There is a lock up of a couple days ie epochs with traditional staking. A warm up before you start earning rewards and a cool down when you unstake your sol. Marinade does solve this problem with a recent feature though, Liquid Unstake. You are able to unstake instantly from any validator for a fee!

Totally recommend staking with Marinade, there is smart contract risk but they were audited by Kudelski Security, the firm that audited Solana blockchain itself, Ackee Blockchain and Neodyme. There is no smart contract risk in traditional staking ie staking with a validator directly but there is risk of delinquency ie no rewards and you aren't decentralizing the blockchain. Marinade delegates your stake to all validators that aren't in the superminority and fulfills the minimum requirements for good behavior and low commission fees. Which totals over 440 validators now, a win for decentralisation 😁 You are also able to instantly stake and earn rewards, you get a proof of stake token mSol that you stake again in defi for higher yields and yeah, that's it.

I have typed a lot🤣 All in all, DYOR!

For good projects, you can check the Solana list in defillama.com, Marinade is currently no 2 by TVL

The main issue was always the inability to handle overflows in bandwidth, this possibly stupid way of putting it essentially means the leader (current person processing transactions) had no way to filter a single or multiple bad actors in the system.

The solution for this specific issue has been to remove the current network protocol UDP to a more TCP-like one, the issue with TCP though is it's too slow with requiring multiple back and forths.

The real solution identified by the team was to use Googles fancy QUIC protocol, from my short research this takes what some of what TCP does but manages to do it in a single call meaning alot quicker speeds.

Because of this (plus local fee markets) Solana has more stability and ways to handle the spikes in user activity in NFT mints where one person may spam thousands of transactions to get in with no downside (due to low fees and the ones that fail dont cost).

I'm sure there is alot more under the hood but this has been the main narrative I've seen regarding the protocol."	4227fcad91787b9a1d7545a0cf6d789ee8d12607	True	False					0	1663669903		0	{}	ip6e241	False	t3_xioko3	False	True	t1_ip6atuv	/r/solana/comments/xioko3/with_all_the_recent_upgrades_and_solana/ip6e241/	1663669915	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]		so i think to answer this question it s good to know why solana fell over numerous times the main issue was always the inability to handle overflows in bandwidth this possibly stupid way of putting it essentially means the leader current person processing transactions had no way to filter a single or multiple bad actors in the system the solution for this specific issue has been to remove the current network protocol udp to a more tcp like one the issue with tcp though is it s too slow with requiring multiple back and forths the real solution identified by the team was to use googles fancy quic protocol from my short research this takes what some of what tcp does but manages to do it in a single call meaning alot quicker speeds because of this plus local fee markets solana has more stability and ways to handle the spikes in user activity in nft mints where one person may spam thousands of transactions to get in with no downside due to low fees and the ones that fail dont cost i m sure there is alot more under the hood but this has been the main narrative i ve seen regarding the protocol 	0.0021436805836856365	0.9885536432266235	0.5530789494514465	0.010945232585072517	0.008905994705855846	0.40150532126426697	0.0971929207444191	8.415512411374948e-07	0.3632194399833679	0.0016962448135018349

Is everyone from all projects in the multisig doxxed? Have we forgotten about the whole Ian Macaliano being a dev of 11 protocols already? I wasn't aware that Solana Labs/Foundation had closer oversight for Marinade compared to their official SPL pools.

As for Foundation upgrade authority, they are way less likely to make a malicious update to their own program which is under the SPL itself compared to a smart contract run and deployed by an independent team that controls hundreds of millions of dollars. The Foundation has way more SOL in things like the delegation program compared to what is in stake pools under their deployments, so it's pocket change to them compared to what they could rug from the rest of the Foundation reserves (so again, very unlikely that Foundation pools are compromised by Foundation itself).

 Additionally, Foundation is going to burn upgrade authority similar to what they did in SPL token, making it basically as secure as SPL token itself (with some additional discussion on even converting the stake pool program to a native program within the Solana core codebase), at that point you cannot compare a non-upgradeable program with an upgradeable program!"	1343471e551a0a79f8c6257fcc8255fb9c00eb9d	True	False					0	1663663056		0	{}	ip664n9	False	t3_xim21o	False	True	t1_ip65rli	/r/solana/comments/xim21o/sol_staking_vs_liquid_msol/ip664n9/	1663663074	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]		it is marinade 3 outside devs from those protocols takes only one rogue dev from 3 protocols to collude with marinade devs and considering it s hundreds of millions of dollars it would be pretty easy to buy out those devs no is everyone from all projects in the multisig doxxed have we forgotten about the whole ian macaliano being a dev of 11 protocols already i wasn t aware that solana labs foundation had closer oversight for marinade compared to their official spl pools as for foundation upgrade authority they are way less likely to make a malicious update to their own program which is under the spl itself compared to a smart contract run and deployed by an independent team that controls hundreds of millions of dollars the foundation has way more sol in things like the delegation program compared to what is in stake pools under their deployments so it s pocket change to them compared to what they could rug from the rest of the foundation reserves so again very unlikely that foundation pools are compromised by foundation itself additionally foundation is going to burn upgrade authority similar to what they did in spl token making it basically as secure as spl token itself with some additional discussion on even converting the stake pool program to a native program within the solana core codebase at that point you cannot compare a non upgradeable program with an upgradeable program 	0.002292244927957654	0.9897425770759583	0.42167022824287415	0.06957166641950607	0.007839575409889221	0.4471282660961151	0.08596830070018768	8.475113304484694e-07	0.4994511604309082	0.00934721902012825

95	[]	False		FunEarnings			[]				text	t2_92eu1zhu	False	False	"Hi there, welcome to the community, this is a great question!

Full disclosure: I run one of the liquid staking pools on Solana called BlazeStake ([stake.solblaze.org](https://stake.solblaze.org)), pretty similar to Marinade but a bit smaller, so I could really use your support! 

When you stake SOL, you essentially lock up your SOL to delegate your voting power to a validator. This validator is responsible for voting on blocks and proposing new blocks in proportion to their total voting power (which grows as more people stake). However, this can lead to centralization by a few big players with large voting power, so it's important to stake to smaller validators to increase decentralization. Additionally, your SOL is locked up to secure the network, so it will take up to 2-3 days to unlock that SOL.

As long as the validator votes on transactions, those votes will turn into rewards that get paid to stakers like you (and validators can take a cut as well to ensure they can pay for server costs, this cut is known as commission and is a percentage of staker earnings). Currently, there's no way to lose money staking SOL directly, the worst that can happen is that the validator goes offline, so you stop receiving rewards. However, slashing may be implemented in the future, where bad validators who submit malicious votes or stop voting may result in lost rewards or lost SOL, so you'll need to monitor the validator you stake with if/when this slashing is implemented (won't happen for at least a year I think) to ensure that you can unstake before you start losing money.

In contrast, liquid staking pools have a lot of benefits that help alleviate some of the pain points of staking with a validator. For the purpose of this explanation, I'll use my pool (BlazeStake) as an example. With BlazeStake, whenever you deposit stake through the main website, your stake gets deposited into a permissionless smart contract (for BlazeStake, this smart contract is owned by the Solana Foundation, and for Marinade, the smart contract is owned by the Marinade developers, so make sure you trust the people who own the smart contract! Solana Foundation is also planning on revoking their ownership of the BlazeStake smart contract pretty soon, making BlazeStake one of the most secure pools to use as nobody will be able to make changes in the future to the code).

Once your SOL is deposited into the smart contract, the SOL is automatically staked with many validators. Depending on the pool, this can be as low as 10-20 validators, but with BlazeStake, your SOL gets spread out across 100+ validators that are picked for their unique contributions to decentralizing the network while maintaining high rewards for stakers. Plus, if one single validator goes offline, this does not impact your rewards that much, as it's only one of 100+ validators that go offline, so in many cases less than 1% of rewards would be lost compared to 100% of rewards if you stake directly with a validator that goes offline. Additionally, the pool automatically destakes from validators that go offline or validators that are about to get slashed, dynamically rebalancing your stake so that the pool is in the most optimal configuration.

When you liquid stake with BlazeStake, you get the bSOL token, which is a direct representation of your staked amount. The price of bSOL increases relative to staking rewards, and you can always redeem that bSOL back for SOL at the smart contract itself, or you can sell directly at a decentralized exchange. In both of these methods, you can perform what is known as liquid unstaking, where you skip past the 2-3 day delay of direct validator unstaking because of the fact that you use a pool token.

An additional benefit of liquid staking is that you can now use these staked tokens in DeFi integrations or for other rewards! In the case of BlazeStake, you can provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges for extra rewards, and you will also be able to get airdropped tokens from Solana projects pretty soon if you are interested in that as a way to increase your rewards.

I hope this comment was informative, but if you have any other questions about the staking process, please feel free to let me know! Also, I hope that you will consider staking with my stake pool, BlazeStake, at [stake.solblaze.org](https://stake.solblaze.org), I could really use your support!"	93d63fa6254ac4431c01472946b93a3541dfa330	True	False					0	1663634440		0	{}	ip4wjny	False	t3_xim21o	False	True	t3_xim21o	/r/solana/comments/xim21o/sol_staking_vs_liquid_msol/ip4wjny/	1663634452	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]		hi there welcome to the community this is a great question full disclosure i run one of the liquid staking pools on solana called blazestake stake solblaze org https stake solblaze org pretty similar to marinade but a bit smaller so i could really use your support when you stake sol you essentially lock up your sol to delegate your voting power to a validator this validator is responsible for voting on blocks and proposing new blocks in proportion to their total voting power which grows as more people stake however this can lead to centralization by a few big players with large voting power so it s important to stake to smaller validators to increase decentralization additionally your sol is locked up to secure the network so it will take up to 2 3 days to unlock that sol as long as the validator votes on transactions those votes will turn into rewards that get paid to stakers like you and validators can take a cut as well to ensure they can pay for server costs this cut is known as commission and is a percentage of staker earnings currently there s no way to lose money staking sol directly the worst that can happen is that the validator goes offline so you stop receiving rewards however slashing may be implemented in the future where bad validators who submit malicious votes or stop voting may result in lost rewards or lost sol so you ll need to monitor the validator you stake with if when this slashing is implemented won t happen for at least a year i think to ensure that you can unstake before you start losing money in contrast liquid staking pools have a lot of benefits that help alleviate some of the pain points of staking with a validator for the purpose of this explanation i ll use my pool blazestake as an example with blazestake whenever you deposit stake through the main website your stake gets deposited into a permissionless smart contract for blazestake this smart contract is owned by the solana foundation and for marinade the smart contract is owned by the marinade developers so make sure you trust the people who own the smart contract solana foundation is also planning on revoking their ownership of the blazestake smart contract pretty soon making blazestake one of the most secure pools to use as nobody will be able to make changes in the future to the code once your sol is deposited into the smart contract the sol is automatically staked with many validators depending on the pool this can be as low as 10 20 validators but with blazestake your sol gets spread out across 100 validators that are picked for their unique contributions to decentralizing the network while maintaining high rewards for stakers plus if one single validator goes offline this does not impact your rewards that much as it s only one of 100 validators that go offline so in many cases less than 1 of rewards would be lost compared to 100 of rewards if you stake directly with a validator that goes offline additionally the pool automatically destakes from validators that go offline or validators that are about to get slashed dynamically rebalancing your stake so that the pool is in the most optimal configuration when you liquid stake with blazestake you get the bsol token which is a direct representation of your staked amount the price of bsol increases relative to staking rewards and you can always redeem that bsol back for sol at the smart contract itself or you can sell directly at a decentralized exchange in both of these methods you can perform what is known as liquid unstaking where you skip past the 2 3 day delay of direct validator unstaking because of the fact that you use a pool token an additional benefit of liquid staking is that you can now use these staked tokens in defi integrations or for other rewards in the case of blazestake you can provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges for extra rewards and you will also be able to get airdropped tokens from solana projects pretty soon if you are interested in that as a way to increase your rewards i hope this comment was informative but if you have any other questions about the staking process please feel free to let me know also i hope that you will consider staking with my stake pool blazestake at stake solblaze org https stake solblaze org i could really use your support 	0.0028546126559376717	0.9886825084686279	0.02098768949508667	0.09052382409572601	0.008357485756278038	0.39025333523750305	0.11562097817659378	8.462230880468269e-07	0.3537948727607727	0.014324704185128212

The question to ask is why would a team even participate in the parachain auction? 

Auctions were very complicated to implement and took a lot of energy from the Polkadot team. From the perspective of a team, they have to deal with this complexity and cost. All for the tiny fraction of users actually on Polkadot. 

Why would they do this? Instead they can just launch on Cosmos and gain access to a thriving ecosystem with users...

IMO Polkadot is suffering from the same problem as Cardano.

According to https://polkawatch.app/validation/ half of the rewards get distributed to 5 entities which leds me to believe that they do control half of the stake as well. A third (which is where Polkadot's nakamoto is at since it uses a BFT finality mechanism) seems to be 3-4 entities.

Where is the 82 number from? Mind you that a single entity can have more than one node. For example the first 5 entities from the site above own 54 validators, not just 5.

Oh and also, Bitcoin does not have a 7k nakamoto coefficient lol that's ridiculous, the number refers to the amount of full nodes on the network, NC is calculated using block producers.
