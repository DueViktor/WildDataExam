Those salivating over sub-10k coins are being unrealistic IMO. If the floor is that low then we have entered a whole new paradigm and we'd might as well just throw out all the historical data because it would be irrelevant...

If we dip back down to 4 digits anytime soon it would be total chaos. No one would have any way of making heads or tails of without any well-fitted trendlines to use as a point of comparison.

I could see us dipping down further toward 15k, but even if holding out for a lower dip pays off, that level of price savings is gonna be insignificant over the timescales you should be holding BTC for.

The play is to start DCA once new price floor stabilizes, keep at it for several months or a year+, and then wait for the next media hype bubble in a couple years.

~10-20k is a perfectly reasonable price for bitcoin IMO and a fantastic entry point for long-term investment.

59	[]	False		Everbanned						"Been following bitcoin since 2011. Used to hold 41 coins, but sold them to take profits in a previous bubble cycle for a pittance compared to what they would have been worth at the peak of this bubble.

I checked out and stopped actively following BTC when there was talk of a hard fork and rising environmental concerns.

I was sure the idea had fundamental flaws and was dead in the water, but still believed that blockchain tech had promise... It seemed like it was only a matter of time until some new altcoin would come along that took the original promise of bitcoin and improved upon it, supplanting it and causing a complete migration.

*It is obvious now that I was wrong. Bitcoin has survived for more than a decade, against all odds.*

It cannot be killed.

And if it continues, then it will absolutely bubble again in the next few years... and possibly again after that. I truly believe that I will see a million dollar coin in my lifetime. Probably sometime around 2030.

I wish I hadn't been such a fool all those years ago by selling my 41 coins for a few thousand dollars. It seemed like so much money at the time. RIP.

To all you newcomers: Stay the course. Don't doubt yourself.

Looking at those same long-term charts I was looking at back when the first halving was making headlines, now is the best time to buy bitcoin I have seen in years.

This recent price action has awakened me from my ignorance to the longevity of this technology. We're way below the longterm trend line right now, yet people are still buying with blood in the streets.

If bitcoin's new low is **twenty thousand dollars** then it is indisputably here to stay. This ecosystem has blossomed in a mere decade far beyond our wildest dreams back in 2011.

When you could buy whole coins for fifty bucks people would have thought you were insane if you told them that coins being sold for $20k in 2022 would be considered a ""crash"". That's my perspective as a 31 year old millennial digital native that has been in this since before the first halving.

I was so sure back then that the old financial system was crumbling, that bitcoin was the future, that it would be around for years, and that coins would be worth several thousand dollars one day... Turns out I was even more right than I knew.

I will never doubt myself again."	3b3d380cf5f4162b38a9f3f2554f47062d2c709d	True	False					0	1655710704		0	{}	id1aohn	False	t3_vgdko4	False	True	t3_vgdko4	/r/Bitcoin/comments/vgdko4/daily_discussion_june_20_2022/id1aohn/	1655710715	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_m4mepzj	False	False		been following bitcoin since 2011 used to hold 41 coins but sold them to take profits in a previous bubble cycle for a pittance compared to what they would have been worth at the peak of this bubble i checked out and stopped actively following btc when there was talk of a hard fork and rising environmental concerns i was sure the idea had fundamental flaws and was dead in the water but still believed that blockchain tech had promise it seemed like it was only a matter of time until some new altcoin would come along that took the original promise of bitcoin and improved upon it supplanting it and causing a complete migration it is obvious now that i was wrong bitcoin has survived for more than a decade against all odds it cannot be killed and if it continues then it will absolutely bubble again in the next few years and possibly again after that i truly believe that i will see a million dollar coin in my lifetime probably sometime around 2030 i wish i hadn t been such a fool all those years ago by selling my 41 coins for a few thousand dollars it seemed like so much money at the time rip to all you newcomers stay the course don t doubt yourself looking at those same long term charts i was looking at back when the first halving was making headlines now is the best time to buy bitcoin i have seen in years this recent price action has awakened me from my ignorance to the longevity of this technology we re way below the longterm trend line right now yet people are still buying with blood in the streets if bitcoin s new low is twenty thousand dollars then it is indisputably here to stay this ecosystem has blossomed in a mere decade far beyond our wildest dreams back in 2011 when you could buy whole coins for fifty bucks people would have thought you were insane if you told them that coins being sold for 20k in 2022 would be considered a crash that s my perspective as a 31 year old millennial digital native that has been in this since before the first halving i was so sure back then that the old financial system was crumbling that bitcoin was the future that it would be around for years and that coins would be worth several thousand dollars one day turns out i was even more right than i knew i will never doubt myself again 	0.0024388511665165424	0.9882557392120361	0.4132782518863678	0.0072087980806827545	0.008499657735228539	0.6060903668403625	0.06470750272274017	8.428098681179108e-07	0.14378368854522705	0.03354915231466293

156	[]	False		Everbanned						"Been following bitcoin since 2011. Used to hold 41 coins, but sold them to take profits in a previous bubble cycle for a pittance compared to what they would have been worth at the peak of this bubble.

I checked out and stopped actively following BTC when there was talk of a hard fork and rising environmental concerns.

I was sure the idea had fundamental flaws and was dead in the water, but still believed that blockchain tech had promise... It seemed like it was only a matter of time until some new altcoin would come along that took the original promise of bitcoin and improved upon it, supplanting it and causing a complete migration.

*It is obvious now that I was wrong. Bitcoin has survived for more than a decade, against all odds.*

It cannot be killed.

And if it continues, then it will absolutely bubble again in the next few years... and possibly again after that. I truly believe that I will see a million dollar coin in my lifetime. Probably sometime around 2030.

I wish I hadn't been such a fool all those years ago by selling my 41 coins for a few thousand dollars. It seemed like so much money at the time. RIP.

To all you newcomers: Stay the course. Don't doubt yourself.

Looking at those same long-term charts I was looking at back when the first halving was making headlines, now is the best time to buy bitcoin I have seen in years.

This recent price action has awakened me from my ignorance to the longevity of this technology. We're way below the longterm trend line right now, yet people are still buying with blood in the streets.

If bitcoin's new low is **twenty thousand dollars** then it is indisputably here to stay. This ecosystem has blossomed in a mere decade far beyond our wildest dreams back in 2011.

When you could buy whole coins for fifty bucks people would have thought you were insane if you told them that coins being sold for $20k in 2022 would be considered a ""crash"". That's my perspective as a 31 year old millennial digital native that has been in this since before the first halving.

I was so sure back then that the old financial system was crumbling, that bitcoin was the future, that it would be around for years, and that coins would be worth several thousand dollars one day... Turns out I was even more right than I knew.

176	[]	False		Everbanned						"Been following bitcoin since 2011. Used to hold 41 coins, but sold them to take profits in a previous bubble cycle for a pittance compared to what they would have been worth at the peak of this bubble.

I checked out and stopped actively following BTC when there was talk of a hard fork and rising environmental concerns.

I was sure the idea had fundamental flaws and was dead in the water, but still believed that blockchain tech had promise... It seemed like it was only a matter of time until some new altcoin would come along that took the original promise of bitcoin and improved upon it, supplanting it and causing a complete migration.

*It is obvious now that I was wrong. Bitcoin has survived for more than a decade, against all odds.*

It cannot be killed.

And if it continues, then it will absolutely bubble again in the next few years... and possibly again after that. I truly believe that I will see a million dollar coin in my lifetime. Probably sometime around 2030.

I wish I hadn't been such a fool all those years ago by selling my 41 coins for a few thousand dollars. It seemed like so much money at the time. RIP.

To all you newcomers: Stay the course. Don't doubt yourself.

Looking at those same long-term charts I was looking at back when the first halving was making headlines, now is the best time to buy bitcoin I have seen in years.

This recent price action has awakened me from my ignorance to the longevity of this technology. We're way below the longterm trend line right now, yet people are still buying with blood in the streets.

If bitcoin's new low is **twenty thousand dollars** then it is indisputably here to stay. This ecosystem has blossomed in a mere decade far beyond our wildest dreams back in 2011.

I was so sure bitcoin was the future, that it would be around for years and that coins would be worth several thousand dollars one day... Turns out I was even more right than I knew.

I will never doubt myself again."	0b2a1dcd44ee2ae9bca11d5637979abd0262dc79	True	False					0	1655708269		0	{}	id17usl	False	t3_vgeks1	False	True	t3_vgeks1	/r/Bitcoin/comments/vgeks1/mentor_monday_june_20_2022_ask_all_your_bitcoin/id17usl/	1655708286	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_m4mepzj	False	False		been following bitcoin since 2011 used to hold 41 coins but sold them to take profits in a previous bubble cycle for a pittance compared to what they would have been worth at the peak of this bubble i checked out and stopped actively following btc when there was talk of a hard fork and rising environmental concerns i was sure the idea had fundamental flaws and was dead in the water but still believed that blockchain tech had promise it seemed like it was only a matter of time until some new altcoin would come along that took the original promise of bitcoin and improved upon it supplanting it and causing a complete migration it is obvious now that i was wrong bitcoin has survived for more than a decade against all odds it cannot be killed and if it continues then it will absolutely bubble again in the next few years and possibly again after that i truly believe that i will see a million dollar coin in my lifetime probably sometime around 2030 i wish i hadn t been such a fool all those years ago by selling my 41 coins for a few thousand dollars it seemed like so much money at the time rip to all you newcomers stay the course don t doubt yourself looking at those same long term charts i was looking at back when the first halving was making headlines now is the best time to buy bitcoin i have seen in years this recent price action has awakened me from my ignorance to the longevity of this technology we re way below the longterm trend line right now yet people are still buying with blood in the streets if bitcoin s new low is twenty thousand dollars then it is indisputably here to stay this ecosystem has blossomed in a mere decade far beyond our wildest dreams back in 2011 i was so sure bitcoin was the future that it would be around for years and that coins would be worth several thousand dollars one day turns out i was even more right than i knew i will never doubt myself again 	0.0024421701673418283	0.9882552623748779	0.3707449436187744	0.007286645472049713	0.008499079383909702	0.6061069369316101	0.06488289684057236	8.428138471572311e-07	0.13887256383895874	0.03356986120343208

The problem is everyone wanted mutable contracts, because it otherwise means you can't profit from any upgrade while you're on the first contract.

When you can suffer from IL in the process or are staking into some liquidity fund that is supposed to freeze your assets for a lot of time, it's not an option. 

Worse, without mutability, you can have bugs you can't get away from, condemned to be stolen whatever you do. 

We could also improve mutable contracts so that they respect trustlessness and self-sovereignty, but no one cares enough for the moment to create an interface based on diamond, but restricting it so that each user can decide whether to follow the upgrade or not. 

But I'm guessing that the market simply isn't yet mature enough. We may get such thing later, once people will have a better idea of the consequences of their naive implementation choices.

That said, there is a problem with DAOs changing the rules of previous contracts.

Lido is a liquid staking derivative (stETH) offering: 3.94%

Yearn is a vault strategy offering: 5.85%
