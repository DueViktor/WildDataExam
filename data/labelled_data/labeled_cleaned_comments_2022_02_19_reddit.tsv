People is just staking in Kraken and other CEX which does not help whatsoever with decentralization.

Cosmos on the other hand is so simple. I regret going balls deep on DOT,not gonna lie. And I bought at 4$,which is better than most people can say.

This sub was always mocking atom ""cos security blablabla"" and I swallowed it. The tech looked really cool so I went in. Gavin is a legend after and parachains looked solid

Well... COSMOS pretty much would have paid my home with airdrops...and instead here I am watching ACA and GLMR being gang banged by dumpers.
