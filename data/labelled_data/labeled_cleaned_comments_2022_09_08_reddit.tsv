22	[]	False		Perleflamme			[]				text	t2_13pqgo	False	False	"&gt;""Unstoppable"" doesn't mean no laws apply

It does. But you're entitled to reframe definitions in any way you like: definition games are inconsequential anyway. 

&gt;the Office for Foreign Asset Controls (OFAC) states that the Tornado Cash entity (essentially “organization”) is being targeted for helping launder the proceeds of cybercrimes, including more than $450 million laundered by North Korea from the proceeds of the Harmony and Nomad bridge hacks. 

This is an arbitrary ruling, as shown by the fact lots of banks regularly violate AML regulations and only get as a result to pay a fine. Arbitrary ruling is illegitimate: if arbitrary ruling was legitimate, we wouldn't need any law to begin with. And very justifyingly, it was the biggest concern people had about how monarchies were ruling in countries where it got challenged during democratic revolutions. 

For this ruling not to be arbitrary, all US citizens should be forbidden to deal with any bank which has ever been found to violate AML regulations. That's the very minimum standard to expect for this ruling not to be arbitrary ruling and, therefore, completely illegitimate. 

&gt;Although Github did in fact remove Tornado Cash’s repo, it did so not because the code was banned, but because providing services such as code hosting to sanctioned parties is forbidden.

Inconsistent with the rest of the article. Github doesn't host the smart contract address. It only hosts the source code. So, either the source code was sanctionned and Github indeed was forced to censor the account or the account wasn't a sanctionned party to begin with. So, which is it?

&gt;Tornado Cash and other mixers seek to address this problem by allowing users to “pool” their funds together in a common liquidity pool

Demonstrably false. Deploy Tornado Cash by changing ETH to any non fungible token and you will see people will only ever receive exactly the tokens they've put in it. This serves as a demonstration no token is pooled with any token of anyone else: you receive exactly the tokens you put in it and never touch any token from anyone else.

&gt;As “money laundering” is defined as “the concealment of the origins of illegally obtained money”, Tornado Cash is also textbook money laundering if the money put in is illegal in origin.

Just as much as taking items from someone else is theft if you've taken it without consent. The problem is violation of consent, not the fact of having taken an item. What was the point, exactly?

&gt;From a pragmatic standpoint, if for example hacked bridge funds are moved immediately to a mixer, it may not be possible to identify the organization responsible since all money movements beyond the mixer are obscured.

Irrelevant. The fact lawmakers try to create unenforceable laws is their concern, not the concern of anyone else. They could also create laws forbidding fire to burn buildings and people. We won't just make it all seem as if it was enforceable. 

&gt;Considering another option, why not limit access only for bad actors rather than for everyone? Though it’s clearly possible to limit the access of bad actors to decentralized tools to some degree (e.g. via address blacklists), this won’t work 100% of the time.

Again with another ""pragmatic"" take. Ok, since it seems to be perceived as important, let's talk about the actually pragmatic take. The sanction did literally nothing to prevent criminals from laundering money. Nothing. The contract still is entirely accessible. All it did was preventing some law-abiding citizens from accessing a service providing for their very important privacy needs. 

As such, from a pragmatic standpoint, not only the sanction was a net negative but, on top of that, it provided literally no positive. What you're defending precisely is a few politicians burning wealth and shooting in the foot of their own citizens. That's the pragmatic standpoint.

&gt;This percentage of illicit activity is almost certainly higher than levels for common payment channels (e.g. cash, bank transfers) or communication tools (e.g. encrypted messaging, email, etc) frequently raised as comparisons.

Source? I'm pretty sure it's the very opposite, as is seen by lots of phone scams, bank refunds and even banks themselves regularly violating AML regulations, so regularly they get fined on a yearly basis. And that's, on top of all, in a very opaque system compared to a very transparent one. Expect actual numbers of AML violations from banks to be much higher than that. 

&gt;Even if a smart contract is deployed with no pre-built controls, it’s not clear this removes all responsibility from the developer as it is “unstoppable” then only by the developer’s choice.

The thing is it is completely lawful when the action is done and there's no way to stop it once it's considered illegal. Retroactively claiming it's illegal and should be punished is illegitimate. Or are we to expect politicians will consider every past of your actions as illegal after the facts? That's clearly not how the law works.

&gt;If someone deliberately pushed a boulder down a hill onto an innocent bystander, the fact the rolling boulder couldn’t be stopped wouldn’t excuse their decision.

If it's a very big boulder slowly going to a path that will destroy a tree, and that pushing the boulder wasn't illegal when it was pushed, then it is legal. If, at some point after the fact, it is decided destroying such sacred tree is illegal, then it can't be retroactively applied to the boulder that has been pushed, even though the boulder hasn't yet reached destination and destroyed the tree.

&gt;Even if Coin Center’s “lack of control” argument satisfies the letter of laws around sanctions, it could be perceived as relying mostly on a loophole.

If you consider arbitrary application of law retroactively as a ""loophole"", I guess you're going to defend dictatorship, since there's literally no difference.

&gt;As regulations for emerging tech can often require several tries to get right, the government could pass a law clarifying that organizations can be sanctioned or punished for deploying fully autonomous smart contracts, or simply give OFAC the additional authority to block smart contract access, whether using sanctions or newly introduced tools.

Maybe you haven't understood the very fact that a censorship-resistant tool isn't meant to be coerced. Be it by a group of thugs or by a state. That's a very important point, because it's how you can ensure there will always be tools available to protect the self-sovereignty of people over their data, their communication and their finances, three needs that are extremely important to provide in a censorship-resistant way, to ensure no wannabe dictator can easily attack political opponents. Don't give to dictators an even easier life.

&gt;What if communities pass laws saying, “you must abide by our community agreement or lose your stake (money) and self-sovereign identity”?

First, you can't lose your self-sovereign identity. Otherwise, it's not a self-sovereign identity to begin with, because it's simply not mechanically designed as such.

Second, the very difference between a blockchain community and a country specifically is about self-sovereignty: first, you can always create more blockchain communities and compete with existing ones; second, you can always enforce your freedom of association.

&gt;For the future however, effective regulation and cooperation with governments can build credibility with and increase adoption by the general public, many of whom today view crypto as a “scam”.

It's literally the other way around: removing censorship-resistance would destroy credibility and transform it into tradfi.

Besides, it would remove a powerful tool ensuring there are ways to prevent the worst from becoming a huge threat. After all, it's not governments in themselves that are a threat. Rather, it's their misuse and exploitation by malevolent people, notably wannabe dictators, at the expense of everyone else.

&gt;Implement regulations as high in the “stack” as possible

That's called a CBDC. To be clear, if any crypto implements that, that means a fork from which will be the birth of a CBDC, in one branch, and a crypto in the other branch, the one that hasn't been changed. 

&gt;At the bottom layer, the “immutable database” layer is designed intentionally to be difficult to modify since it provides the security and reliability on which higher layers depend.

Ah, now you see why it's useless to implement regulation ""as high as possible"".

&gt;while finding ways to leverage technological flexibility higher in the stack to create room for governments and blockchains to co-exist peacefully.

That's not the point, at all."	d63a02a51a14c7551eefa5422a4b28173f1f2f5c	True	False					0	1662531750		0	{}	inf2uza	False	t3_x7tuew	False	True	t3_x7tuew	/r/ethereum/comments/x7tuew/tornado_cash_and_the_regulation_of_smart_contracts/inf2uza/	1662531763	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

In [another blog post, they detailed more information about how the security between types of ENS domains are different](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/how-eth-names-compare-to-dns-names-imported-to-ens-ab855a6dbdb2).

&gt; The two kinds of names have different security models.
&gt; 
&gt; Because .ETH names are native to ENS, ENS is the only source of truth for who owns a particular one, and no admin powers exist in ENS to take away a user’s .ETH name.
&gt; 
&gt; Such admin powers do ultimately exist, however, for DNS names on ENS. Because whoever owns the name on DNS can always claim the corresponding name on ENS, the ultimate security of a DNS name on ENS depends on the security of the name on DNS.
&gt; 
&gt; Further, while the ENS root keyholders have locked the .ETH TLD (so that they no longer control it), they have not done this for any DNS TLDs on ENS. While it is unlikely, this means that it would be possible for the ENS root keyholders to take control of a DNS TLD, and thus any of its 2LDs, on ENS.

They're also transferred when the DNS is changed

&gt; DNS names on ENS, however, can only be transferred if the DNS name’s TXT record is first changed to the new Ethereum address. This is because the ultimate source of truth for who owns a DNS name on ENS is on DNS.

It might be possible to decentralize the reporting more, but, I don't think it really matters considering normal domains are heavily centralized. Anyway, I encourage you to check the first reply if you want more information."	8e52400de11524314d92a261ef6059656424c050	True	False					0	1662530277		0	{}	inf0s0s	False	t3_x6ywld	False	True	t1_inexr47	/r/ethereum/comments/x6ywld/ens_should_offer_a_holding_cell_for_people_to/inf0s0s/	1662530293	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

And here, the scarce resource you could model is about post position in a post ordering list. As such, when you post, you can either do it freely and be last in that list or spend tokens to come higher. Then, you can be given tokens by people depending on the relevance of your post. As such, you can pay for the advertisement of being first in the list, to ensure more people view your post, because you believe lots of people will find it useful enough to notify it as relevant and give tokens to you. 

But by posting anywhere except at the last position, you push some people away from where they were. So, you could handle that by actually staking tokens rather than spending them. And then, staked tokens are regularly spent depending on how high the post is in the list. 

That's the spending part of the tokenomics, revolving around a scarce resource. 

Then, you can model the issuance part. Well, the issuance could be done by another token or the same token being staked to generate more tokens or anything to provide more tokens over time to people providing a service. Now as to what service to provide, that is a good question. Ideally, nothing tied to Karma, due to its very easy manipulation. Just being a Reddit viewer, as some sort of consumer? More than that? It's the half I'm struggling with.

Interestingly enough, this at least means it can be either handled by Reddit or any front end parsing Reddit posts and showing them in any order. So, technically, being a viewer looking at advertisements (if there's nothing else that can be done to monetize it) is a service provided to the front end and that could ensure there's a service and there are tokens users could earn, at the very least."	62bb03c7dc52c670015148a46f16a022aaf2656d	True	False					0	1662523700		0	{}	ineq3bn	False	t3_x7tx4l	False	True	t3_x7tx4l	/r/ethereum/comments/x7tx4l/paid_to_post_the_monetization_of_reddit_karma_and/ineq3bn/	1662523716	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

He took screenshots of the transaction with the block number, TXN Hash, gas fees, etc, which look identical to the Etherscan page you would normally look at. He was telling me that my ETH should be coming but hours later I still hadn't receieved it (I was looking at the Ethereum Main Network of course). As I said above, his screenshots listed ""indexing"" under the status when veiwing in Etherscan. I believe this is because it was on the test network vs Ethereum mainnet. I did heavy searching and couldn't find anyone talking about a situation where the status lists ""indexing"" instead of ""success"" or ""pending"". I also searched the TXN Hash and Block number on Etherscan and couldn't find it.... because it was actually on a fake network. 

So if you are reading this and seeing the same indexing issue and haven't receieved your ETH, MAKE SURE YOU AREN'T BEING SCAMMED! Check some of the test networks and see if you receieved the fake ETH there. The transaction he sent went through right away so the screenshot he sent was listed as ""confirmed"", but when viewing in Etherscan said ""indexing"" instead of ""success"".

1. Many websites accept just a username and password because in the worst case scenario for those websites, someone just posts something under your name on Facebook or deletes a bunch of your photos. With crypto, the worst case scenario is a monetary loss.
2. Banks accept just a username and password even though there is a potential monetary loss because banks are able to reverse many monetary transactions given the right legal framework even when money is transferred to another country. Most crypto transactions cannot be reversed.
3. Banks themselves are shielded from being responsible for your monetary loss under certain situations because banks are regulated and the government will step in and protect them from you. Crypto companies are not regulated so they must take the full legal repercussions if they or you suffer monetary loss. Therefore they prefer not to manage your crypto on your behalf.
4. Most crypto exchanges don't just use a username and password but also use multi-factor authentication including SMS code for each transaction. They also run a risky business and try to protect themselves from monetary responsibility by requiring KYC from all customers and preventing customers from withdrawing their crypto if they suspect there is foul play. Other exchanges protect themselves by incorporating in a country with lax regulation and don't reveal the real identities of the owners so that they can disappear at any time. Some even register themselves as an investment company so that your funds are technically investments in the eyes of the law and therefore are not as well protected."	b711a2438f6168be2b6371199b4ba8de508a5fa4	True	False					0	1662557631		0	{}	ing5tai	False	t3_x7u8ya	False	True	t3_x7u8ya	/r/ethereum/comments/x7u8ya/why_dont_we_see_more_online_wallets_based_on/ing5tai/	1662557642	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

There is a program/interface that works with the wallet to approve and send funds* important note; if the seed phrase was ever compromised, you can technically send from ANY wallet , again, the security here is your specific seed has NEVER touched the internet . So until your seed is compromised all of your funds are secure in the wallet. Second, removing the private key from metamask will help but it’s still internet facing so you are still able to be tricked or duped to connect your wallet to something	c74db0c3edbe84a5a7297fce5b3aad892aecd541	True	False					0	1662553668		0	{}	infxdkp	False	t3_x7dvfl	False	True	t1_infv7qo	/r/ethereum/comments/x7dvfl/my_trezor_was_drained_of_128_eth/infxdkp/	1662553681	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

188	[]	False		FaceDeer			[]				text	t2_4ljvm	False	False	"When the Merge happens, in about a week or so, there is the possibility that a second fork of the chain may exist for a while that commonly goes by the name ""ETHW"". This is the old proof-of-work chain that some dead-ender PoW miners have vowed to keep ""alive."" Most people here expect it to be a damp squib of a blockchain that will fizzle out immediately, and if you agree or don't care about that then you can just proceed as normal. However, some folks are going to make an attempt to sell off the ETHW tokens that they have on that chain (all tokens are duplicated across both chains in the event of a chain split like this) and if you happened to want to do something like that you need to tread carefully. Any transactions you post on the ETHW chain could be ""replayed"" to the proof-of-stake ETH chain. If you don't take care you might end up losing valuable tokens.

Probably the easiest approach if you want to try this would be to move your tokens off of centralized exchanges (as you have done), and then wait for an exchange to announce that they're providing a ""splitting"" service supporting both ETH and ETHW. Then get an account with that exchange and send your tokens to them. The transaction sending those tokens will be replayed on both chains, the exchange will get both sets of tokens, and then you can just tell them ""sell my ETHW for whatever they're worth"" and you'll maybe get something out of it.

Personally I wouldn't bother, I share the common opinion that ETHW will crash to near-zero in price almost immediately and never recover. So you can basically ignore everything I just said and live life as you were doing before. :)"	20dcbc34a8a2d6eafb33f02303739b6979208b74	True	False					0	1662589594		0	{}	inih14f	False	t3_x7zoto	False	True	t1_infg97h	/r/ethereum/comments/x7zoto/i_have_eth_sitting_in_a_few_different_exchanges/inih14f/	1662589606	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]
