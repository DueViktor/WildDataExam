As I understand it, the bank lends the money they do not physically have and creates a debt to be repaid.  This increases the banks balance sheet and increases broad money but not actual money in circulation.  

At the end of financial cycles or bull runs in the market, money is easy to get, rates are low and banks are handing out loans to anyone (the last 10 years).  They are now raising rates to fight inflation caused from increased demand for goods and services as everyone is flush with cash.  

This is a separate from quantitative easing where the fed simply prints more money into the money supply decreasing the value of everyone's dollar.  I believe they do this mostly through buying bonds and propping up the entire market in general.  

Probably butchered that last part and dont fully understand it.

 Lightning network is like as if you met someone in person and you both agreed to create a shared Bitcoin wallet that requires to use two keys to do any actions with the shared balance. 

Both of you put some money inside that shared wallet, but then every time you wanna make a transaction both of you have to agree by using your key. 

Each time you make a transaction on lightning you create a contract that states how much you own and how much your friend owns in that shared wallet.

This means that while much functionality may be possible, some things that computers can do are simply impossible in your restricted model of computation."	a53cc0f2200621b6a494262cafb245a71e54271e	True	False					0	1662000365		0	{}	imlzyby	False	t3_x2sdsp	False	True	t1_imlxedz	/r/Bitcoin/comments/x2sdsp/can_someone_please_explain_what_theyre_beefing/imlzyby/	1662000383	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]

That's because you are the one doing it.

Imho, L2 is for companies/service providers.

For example:

- Mark Cuban said they are releasing NFT for Dallas Mavericks season tickets 
- people will just buy using Visa on Dallas Mavs website.
- and the ticket NFT will be shown on either metamask or some special mavericks wallet.

All bridging etc. happened in the back.

Same goes with gaming NFT, insurance service etc.

All these activities will eventually settled on L1, burning ETH.. and so on.

----

Us who invest in, should just stick on L1 imho. Of course you can invest on L2 tokens too."	5e5d5266af1fae090c588286da0af7651edd4b2c	True	False					0	1661998414		0	{}	imlvr05	False	t3_x27cdf	False	True	t1_imirp74	/r/ethereum/comments/x27cdf/to_quote_the_ethereum_foundation_the_ethereum/imlvr05/	1661998425	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

False. This is literally the dirt pie fallacy.

I can create dirt pies. I put lots of effort in it. It costs me a lot to do them, in money as well as in time. In electricity, even, to bake them. But it is clear it's worthless and I'm not the one dictating its price. It is worthless and there's nothing I can dictate about it.

That's Bitcoin. Except that there are users who want to buy Bitcoin, at the price they want as a whole. That's what matters: users, who compete between each others to buy products. Miners don't dictate the price at all. It's only availability of the products and of the demand, nothing else.

As a proof, it's Bitcoin's price that dictates how many miners will mine the tokens, not the other way around. You don't see miners increasing the mining difficulty inconsequently and price following them. No. You see price increasing and miners following until price doesn't increase anymore and, suddenly, miners stop increasing mining difficulty. Did they decide price was enough? No. They didn't decide anything. Users decided.

And when Bitcoin's price decreases, is it that miners finally consider the price is too high and that they want to stop mining? No. They didn't decide anything. Users decided. And miners followed by mining less as a result.

&gt;And it is getting harder and harder with every 4 years. In my opinion this is THE main and important thing.

What you're seeing is a temporarily somewhat constant demand that is suddenly met with a halvening of newly available tokens. This is what drives prices higher, because demand is suddenly met with a halved offer. It has nothing to do with the effort miners put in it, as has already been shown above. Of course, miners won't sell at a loss, but that is not regulated by selling higher as if miners could decide about that. Instead, that is regulated by miners mining less and, as a result, difficulty decreasing to match user's demand."	db48369254240a0242f16721eebadec1c18e18c5	True	False					0	1662018808		0	{}	immsn19	False	t3_x1tmeb	False	True	t1_immnlk5	/r/ethereum/comments/x1tmeb/friedrich_august_hayek_nobel_prize_laureate_in/immsn19/	1662018823	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

I say Blackbox with known behavior because you can fully see its behavior, yet you don't need to know how it works or who's behind. There probably are many other people behind that black box. For instance, as a lender, there probably are many borrowers, but they don't matter. 

This is due to trustlessness. And that trustlessness can't be maintained without decentralization, because the lack of decentralization means at least one person can harm trustlessness. And even with decentralization, people can propose trustfulness, as can be seen with diamond interfaces and lots of contracts being upgradable without user's consent. 

So, sure, idealism is useless in itself. I agree. But these ideals aren't favored by people for nothing. They are favored because they provide useful properties, like trustlessness. Or self-sovereignty. Or any other. 

With a centralized cloud provider (meaning, one that controls the entirety of the service, without anyone being able to compete with the same data), the cloud provider has full authority to censor your actions. This means you can put your whole business in that chain and you're completely hostage of that cloud provider. It can then decide to ask for any part of your profitability without you being able to do anything about it. It's called user capture. 

But that's not all. The cloud provider, controlling the entirety of the data, also has full control regarding the data itself. It can forget any data it dislikes. It can also replace any data it dislikes by another. 

You're left with a service you can't trust by itself. You need to fully trust that service provider. And to trust the fact it won't be hacked in any way, all while you can't estimate the solidity of its infrastructure.

[Ethereum already has identical distribution to BTC.](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). There is literally nothing to lose by moving to a better consensus algorithm. I'm not reading your bitcoin bible for obvious reasons, but I imagine the key argument is that if a money is printed out of thin air, it cannot be credibly neutral - the thing is though, we are **years** past this point, distribution is over, and now Ether inflates less too, meaning it is draining much less value than Bitcoin is, while also having a myriad of other metrics driving value to it. This is in sharp contrast to Bitcoin which is practically speaking an unused/low demand money backed only by flimsy/vague narratives.

POW is literally just a mechanism to coerce people to agree on which block is correct - this can be done without ridiculous amount of waste by having something at stake. **There's nothing magically bad about it, no matter how much you repeat it to yourselves.** 

&gt;PoW to PoS is a dangerous move.

Not even a little bit, but since you are \*forced\* to stick to POW, you have to justify it - it's actually really tragic to watch, because it doesn't take very much effort to realize how superior POS is.

A smart contract on a centralized provider could easily be tampered with, censored, or even shut down by that provider. In that situation, you would have to trust that provider to never commit any of the aforementioned behaviors. If you want to see how that typically goes, check out any of the Web2 apps. Basically, smart contracts exist on blockchains for the same reason that cryptocurrency does: to eliminate the necessity of trust.	e7b93b4001bada2d37c1c493d5dbc768b1746074	True	False					0	1662015539		0	{}	immomh1	False	t3_x30702	False	True	t3_x30702	/r/ethereum/comments/x30702/why_do_you_need_blockchain_for_smart_contracts/immomh1/	1662015550	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

I love your project and the idea behind it!  
I am not a developer, but as a long term HODLer I was thinking somebody should do a historical view of transactions and combine it with NFT minting for historical dates.  
What I mean by this, it would be great if your tool would track all our individual transactions and if we would be able to mint some ""historical NFTs"" on some website attached to your tool proving our involvement during specific events.  
For example:  
\- 1 NFT for ETH holders which have transactions older then 3 years ago -&gt; some diamond handed NFT  
\- 1 NFT for ETH holders which were before the Mt.Gox collapse -&gt; some NFT for Mt.Gox survivor  
\- 1 NFT for ETH holders which bought the bottom in 2018 -&gt; some NFT with blood in the streets    
etc.  
  
These are just some examples of NFT collectibles highlighting specific events in ETHs history.   


But I would happily pay some \~0.1 ETH to be able to mint NFTs which are linked to historical dates so that I can flex them in the future (to be able to prove based on the transaction history that I was part of the ETH history :-) )

  
Maybe they should be non-transferable NFTs, so that the NFTs remain in the account which they were minted from.  
I think there would be demand for these historical NFTs for flexing and you could do a new NFT for each important event in ETHs history.  
  
What do you think of this idea?

I would pay to collect these NFTs bought for ETH as well as for BTC"	22019d8eae33e742497c87a560fbc1d2122ac18f	True	False					0	1662015363		0	{}	immoelh	False	t3_x1t5lk	False	True	t3_x1t5lk	/r/ethereum/comments/x1t5lk/wrote_a_tool_to_generate_historical_pnl_of_any/immoelh/	1662015375	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]

**NOT EVERY** work generates value. But value can **ONLY** created by work.

Big difference. Dirt pie is useless while Bitcoin is useful.

Also, you say not miners but ""users"" sets the price. Then define users. Users means buyers and sellers? Well then think about that miners are users too.  


Being a miner costs you money. It is a business. You don't want to have a loss, so you only sell when such selling can make you a dime. If supply decreases, the price increases. Here is the work. Here is the value which is generated with investing money, effort, power, time and logical decision making. This is something which PoS doesn't have. And it also gets halved by four years. A perfectly fabricated ""self fulfilling prophecy"".  


Gold wouldn't be valuable if you could find it in your garden among other rocks. It is valuable because we have to dig the earth and search for it which costs money, effort, power, time and logical decision making. Also known as work.  


You cannot make value without work. Value is something which is useful for us and hard to obtain in terms of effort, power, time and using our brain.  


Read the Bitcoin standard book. The first chapter is not even about Bitcoin or Cryptocurrencies. It is about how humanity created money. It is clearly stated in that chapter that every empire collapsed who changed their money minting method from a work based one into a printing based one.  


You cannot make value out of thin air, think of anything in your life which makes you happy. A plate of warm and tasty meal, your computer, your friendships, your family, the money in your pocket which you got in exchange of your work done in your job. Name one thing which is valuable and easy to get. One thing.  


Learning a profession, having a muscular and fit body, getting a girlfriend/wife, raising children, building a house, learning to play a musical instrument, learning a new language.  


There is no free value. Value equals work.

With a 'smart' contract, the courts aren't required, since everything is written and enforceable by code.  But that only works assuming that no one can alter the code.  If the smart contract is run on a centralized server, then that means whoever controls the server can change the code.  And if that's the case, then why are you running a digital contract anyways? Just take it off-line and let it be enforced by the legal system.

The whole reason that decentralization and smart contracts go hand-in-hand is because both parties agreeing to the contract need to believe that no single entity can alter the parameters.

With the growing issues (and concerns), of ever encroaching regulatory mandates and restrictions (i.e. forced CBDCs, mandatory KYC, Sanctions on Protocols like Tornado Cash, and the arresting of Blockchain developers with no charges, etc.)  How will the Polkadot eco-system and its para-chains be able to maintain its integrity as a decentralized and safe system that is effectively able to bypass and avoid over reaching regulatory scrutiny?

Polkadot has shared security which secures both the token and the arbitrary data passed by smart contracts. Each Cosmos chain has it's own bootstrapped security which causes differing levels of security and makes passing smart contracts data very difficult. Only as strong as your weakest link kinda thing. IBC does a decent job with token transfers (more than decent as it's simpler than the DOT design).
