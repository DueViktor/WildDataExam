PoW mining makes sure that the history is objectively verifiable. You can take the blockchain without any outside information and immediately see which branch has the most energy invested to mine and is therefor the correct one. This is only possible because mining uses an external resource, energy.

You probably think using energy is always bad. But most energy on the planet gets wasted or isn't really usable by humans. Especially green energy has a problem with being weather dependent. This is where we increasingly see Bitcoin miners come in and monetize energy that would go otherwise to waste, which allows this power plants to expand and overproduce to deliver enough power to households, even if weather conditions are not optimal.

Mining does not compete with human households for energy, it uses energy they can't ever use and is therefor extremely cheaper. It helps to make renewables more competitive by monetizing energy they produce that would otherwise go to waste, because of it's singular property of being extremely dynamic load, that can be turned on or off within seconds.

People who tell you that Bitcoin mining is bad for the environment usually don't have a clue how power grids and production works, or they have other malicious intentions to villainize Bitcoin."	ff534ed9beedfcdd425ab20f08cf99940e3b198e	True	False					0	1657526428		0	{}	ifp4z3h	False	t3_vwcfe6	False	True	t3_vwcfe6	/r/Bitcoin/comments/vwcfe6/whats_the_benefit_of_mining_why_did_they_not/ifp4z3h/	1657526444	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]

The fact is you need to be able to privately spend Bitcoin directly if you live somewhere like China. Furthermore, you need stores and services to accept that Bitcoin without revealing that they do. You need an entire community to secretly exchange in it keeping the state in the dark, hoping no one in the group is caught and coerced into exposing you.

Bitcoin is free for anyone to own but it’s not free for anyone to use anywhere. If you can’t sell it and move funds to your bank without getting exposed and arrested you’re blocked in that direction. If you can’t find a trusted circular economy then you’re screwed there.

Bitcoin doesn’t just instantly solve value retention for people in China. It only helps if you are trying to leave China with wealth. Even then it requires being careful about how you buy it.

That’s all I’m saying. Bitcoin is not easy to use in China and is downright impossible for local economic purposes.

Again, the epistemological views of the people within this subreddit is detached from the epistemological worldview outside of it.

If that article has been debunked, provide the debunking. Meanwhile, a minority of the 89% of Americans will use Bitcoin as a speculative instrument and an even smaller minority will make it a part of their investment portfolio or use it for transactional purposes.

The skill level in comparison to the general public, I would argue is somewhat similar in feeling to the days of requiring a knowledge of BASIC to make the most of a PC. Furthermore, the risk of loss - something that was minor with a BASIC system where you could reload from a backup - is far more real and serious as it carries financial implications that have no custodian party who can intervene and fix a mistake.

The CeFi/DeFi crisis currently occurring has further cemented in the short term memory of the public the risk of participating in this community, and developers struggle to make meaningful movements as the current incentives for the blockchain environment favour minimal iteration and maintenance of the current system - for the risk of volatility or a fork carries too great a risk for the mining pools.

I want to see a financial system that is decentralised, I want to see reasonable transaction rates, I want to see a dispute resolution process that can be ran on a side chain where real people volunteer time through a node to view disputes and filter them for a judicial decision to be made by a separate group - with statically significant dispersion of decision groups to prevent collusion and allow for transactions to be corrected in the event of breaches of contract where escrows have failed.

What I have currently - a fiat system that is outperforming Bitcoin over the last year in terms of inflation values, allows me to transact through custodial systems from my perspective at a near immediate rate - though settlements are far slower. Centralised financial institutions that must meet various regulatory requirements from Basel III, Mifid, AML and in many jurisdictions now, a separation of customer savings and CDs from investment banking. Though still risk of a seizure of my assets in the event of a systemic failure.

Or, a cryptocurrency that is not widely accepted, struggles to gain acceptance due to the technical challenges for many regular consumers and businesses - given risk of losing access to wallet or issues with custodial organisations failing. A faster settlement time, though slower transaction rate in real time. And worst of all, a community who refuses to listen to the general populace and those with backgrounds in finance/economics who understand why our system requires certain aspects of regulation and user friendly services in order to gain adoption - then when crises have occurred, have realisations that certain changes must occur, but again struggle to make them happen on chain due to the true concentration of control in the hands of a few thousand miners - as opposed to the billions of potential users in the market.

The debt crisis can be resolved by less spending and paying off debt. But, our government won’t do that as they keep borrowing off the backs of the US Taxpayer. 

To help alleviate inflation the Fed or Federal Reserve were to buy US Bonds as it would take some USD out of circulation causing the USD to be a little more scarce in circulation. I don’t the they’ll be buying any bonds anytime soon. 

If the Fed were to “buy back” XRP, that would indicate to me that the Gov is taking over XRP. 

Like the opposite of taking the US of the gold standard. They wanted citizens to turn in Gold and paid a certain amount for each ounce of Gold. In fact, the Gov made it illegal for citizens to own Gold. Once they collected the Gold that was given up, the price either tripled or quadrupled in price from what they bought it back for."	ceaf2350a21a64bb2e02d37cec8111624eaa34c0	True	False					0	1657578445		0	{}	ifs60kr	False	t3_tkrmz9	False	True	t3_tkrmz9	/r/XRP/comments/tkrmz9/how_does_a_fed_reserve_buyback_of_xrp_alleviate/ifs60kr/	1657578485	1	True	True	False	XRP	t5_2ruj5	r/XRP	public		0	[]												
206	[]	False		Doge_to_1000			[]				text	t2_bnph5gc7	False	False	"You definitely don’t understand how XRP works nor the mass adoption outside the United Staes, which only is happening because of the overreach of the SEC. 

XRP is designed to to move ALL the money. The hinderance, as I mentioned above, is the SEC. They’re delaying the case for some odd reason. They have yet to prove their case XRP is a security. Anyone with half a brain knows it’s a digital currency. We all know currencies are a commodity. And so does the Governments outside the US. 

The current cross border payment system used , SWIFT, moves $1.2quadrillion in a year (250 business days). 

If XRP was used to move 10% ($1.2trillion) and there is only 48,343,101,197 XRP in circulation. Like Bitcoin, there can be no more XRP created. The total supply is already maxed. Quite a bit honestly…

So if multiple central banks, banks or Governments want to move 100’s of billions or dollars at the same time, the current price of XRP is so cheap that they would buy up the supply, causing delays in transactions, higher fees to move their money and lastly, it would defeat the purpose of the XRPL. XRPL was created for almost instant settlement, cheaper and secure transactions. SWIFT is expensive, a middle man is required and slow as it takes up to 10 business days to complete a single transaction.

So the way to combat the supply from being bought, price would have to rise so that XRPL can continue operating with no delays or higher costs. 

If XRP does move just 10% ($1.2 trillion) XRP price would have to go up and if my math is correct, it would mean XRP would go to a minimum of $26. As David Schwartz stated, it doesn’t make sense for XRP to be dirt cheap. Another speculation is the SEC loses its case, then the sky is the limit for XRP. So if XRP moves $12trillion then XRP would have to go to a minimum of $260 and so on. 

$24trillion XRP = minimum of $496
$48trillion XRP = minimum of $992
$96trillion XRP = minimum of $1,985
$192trillion XRP = minimum of $3,976
Etc… 

If XRP took over SWIFTs current job of moving all the money $1.2quadrillion, XRP would have to reach a minimum of $24,822.

Again my math might be off as in low or even high. But $1.2quadrillion / 48,343,107,197 = $24,822.5666404.


I buy XRP every chance I get, I see the real use case and all the agreements signed with world central banks and other financial institutions. Just imagine if Ripple wins against the SEC, the American banks will jump to sign on as it’s going to save them tons of money for international business deals/sending money world wide compared to the SWIFT system."	2b7bdb5d8cf89319fe6883689d3ff8f1e06b8be2	True	False					0	1657578072		0	{}	ifs540l	False	t3_tkrmz9	False	True	t1_i1s7ps2	/r/XRP/comments/tkrmz9/how_does_a_fed_reserve_buyback_of_xrp_alleviate/ifs540l/	1657578087	1	True	True	False	XRP	t5_2ruj5	r/XRP	public		0	[]

It’s very difficult to imagine a future in which crypto adoption is widespread that BTC is not a significant part of — at least in the next 10-20 years, which is as far ahead as any of us can reasonably look given the rate of technological progression. 

Once more sovereign wealth and other institutional investors get into crypto, they will initially get into BTC as the surest and safest play. This will increase its value. Anyone who has a bigger conviction play has a lot of rationalizing to do. BTC is not going to be the most lucrative play, of course, since it’s market cap is already quite high.

Check if user have NFT in the wallet using this package for example https://github.com/NftEyez/sol-rayz . But then user can send NFT to different owned wallet before minting another one to bypass this check. and anyone accessing your CM directly on Solana will bypass your frontend check as well. So I think more correct way to do such check is on CM rust code. I suppose it can be done fetching all minted NFTs and checking wallet who did mint TX. Also, Such CM changes may take much more time to code. And again user can just create new wallet and mint from it to bypass such check	c564d633bc6afbba8ab98791784ada525914966a	True	False					0	1657539231		0	{}	ifpkwzo	False	t3_vwedki	False	True	t3_vwedki	/r/solana/comments/vwedki/nft_programming/ifpkwzo/	1657539243	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]

        receiverTokenAccount,
        senderKey,

Then I added all the built instructions to a Transaction object and supplied it with the blockhash as well as the fee payer (I could not serialize it without them):  


    const transaction = new Transaction().add(...txInstructions);
transaction.recentBlockhash = (await connection.getRecentBlockhash()).blockhash;
transaction.feePayer = senderKey;

From there, I've serialized the transaction and sent it to the client. The client deserializes the payload into a Transaction object (Transaction.from(payload)) and passes the object directly into the sendTransaction method :)"	87ac92a0ffbb95ed53b3651b21dbbeb0d90757b3	True	False					0	1657551557		0	{}	ifq9rn4	True	t3_vvv7b3	False	True	t1_ifq4lw7	/r/solana/comments/vvv7b3/building_transactions_via_api_using_web3js_and/ifq9rn4/	1657551577	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]

Receive the transaction object from the API, and sign by passing the transaction into signTransaction()
