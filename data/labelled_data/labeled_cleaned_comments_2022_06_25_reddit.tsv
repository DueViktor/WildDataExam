Sure, but it only requires that anyone can participate, without any saying or consideration about the people who are currently participating. The same would obviously go for the chain consensus. 

&gt;When the tokens are concentrated in a bunch of wallets, there is always a risk of unfair administration or unequal power distribution. The few wallets can vote on the desired proposal, thereby reducing decentralization.

Plain wrong. Tokens and wealth don't provide any amount of power, here. That's because you can always fork and compete. That's how you get decentralization.

The only time when tokens give power is when the collective it forms directly owns something, like a DAO owning something. It's not a good idea, as it introduces a vulnerability and an incentive to acquire 51% of the tokens to seize 100% of the assets, but some people sadly do that. Don't, because it is very precisely what can become hurtful. 

&gt;This leads to the risk of unfair rules everyone must follow, similar to the present democratic system.

That's an author who doesn't know what a fork is, it seems.

&gt;In addition, this poses regulatory risks, which are always on the lookout for crypto projects that depend on a single entity for their progress, thereby labelling themselves as an unregistered security.

This is completely stupid. The fact someone owns lots of tokens doesn't magically allows enforcement. The big owner can either sell or get rejected by the rest of the community as soon as it tries to become a coerced entity hurting the community.

Ok, same problem with the view on infrastructure layer. Infura isn't a problem, because you can always replace it.

I look at ICP, Cosmos, Polkadot and them using different languages and all these silly buzzwords is one of the most annoying things about Web 3 development. This has got to be worse than Javascript getting a new package every day. Whether or not their blockchain really ""needs"" another language, I don't know but, these people really have no clue how important it is to try and build in a language that devs already know. Just look at Javascript and Python. Many elitist engineers hate these two languages because of how ""slow"" or how many ""antipatterns"" there are but they are very easy languages to pick up and start coding, and not only that once those started building a network effect itself, there was no stopping those languages from growing.   


Sigh, blockchain will be hindered so much because they don't realize how important it is for devs to have existing resources and not be bogged down by all these silly buzzwords you see in the other blockchains.

I was telling all my friends and family the entire time bitcoin and crypto would be the future. I almost bought 2 bitcoin in 2015 but pussied out because it was a lot of money for me at the time and being young and dumb, I spent it on drink and pissed it up the wall. Hindsight.
