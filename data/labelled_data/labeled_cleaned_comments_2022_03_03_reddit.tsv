I.e., the moment where you heard bitcoin was a thing some were buying/using for allegedly beneficial reasons you didn't quite understand at the time. I certainly had that moment in 2017 and, without doing the research, began sweeping the pennies left in my investment accounts into bitcoin. Today, those pennies turned sats are now worth over 200% what I paid for them. It took me nearly 3 years after blindly sweeping change into bitcoin to find and go down the bitcoin rabbit hole. Had I bothered to do the research sooner, I'd be far better off. All good though. I don't regret my journey one bit. 

My point: tens of thousands of people across the globe just had their first bitcoin moment. The seed is easily planted. At their own pace, many will find the rabbit hole and do the work it takes to understand wtf we're dealing with here. Gradually, then suddenly.

1) Do not connect your cold wallet device to the internet.   You lost the BTC in you HOT wallet, which is still a bummer but it isnt something impossibile to happen.

2) Never use a VPN*, you are just handing over your data to their server. Nice service to have if you want to be anon, but you are basically trusting the people who own the server not to sniff your data. There is no need in using a VPN unless you arent able to access internet without it. And if you need to use it, pay for it and use the most reputable service.

3) Never use an old phone as hot wallet. The problem is in the software, Android 7 is pretty old and probably full of 0 days exploits (aka they can hack your phone and access it without you even touching anything). Since security patches are not delivered on older androids, it is easier as the time passes to find one  cheaply. 

What could have happened: 
Step 1:
You use said vpn to access the internet and by doing so you provide the information about your btc holdings and your device. I think the update has nothing to do with it, every time you connected through the vpn you risked someome else sniffing your traffic. 
Step 2: 
then the used a 0 days attack and gained access to your device.

Maybe the hacker did step 1 way back and just waited you to connect again in order to proceed with step 2.
