1) Do not connect your cold wallet device to the internet.   You lost the BTC in you HOT wallet, which is still a bummer but it isnt something impossibile to happen.

2) Never use a VPN*, you are just handing over your data to their server. Nice service to have if you want to be anon, but you are basically trusting the people who own the server not to sniff your data. There is no need in using a VPN unless you arent able to access internet without it. And if you need to use it, pay for it and use the most reputable service.

3) Never use an old phone as hot wallet. The problem is in the software, Android 7 is pretty old and probably full of 0 days exploits (aka they can hack your phone and access it without you even touching anything). Since security patches are not delivered on older androids, it is easier as the time passes to find one  cheaply. 

What could have happened: 
Step 1:
You use said vpn to access the internet and by doing so you provide the information about your btc holdings and your device. I think the update has nothing to do with it, every time you connected through the vpn you risked someome else sniffing your traffic. 
Step 2: 
then the used a 0 days attack and gained access to your device.

Maybe the hacker did step 1 way back and just waited you to connect again in order to proceed with step 2.

There's been a total lack of progress in Ethereum. It's still PoW with Bitcoin-class fees. There's no PoS consensus, there's no sharding, there's no cross-shard communications.

There's absolutely nothing in Github to show progress on any of these fronts. There doesn't seem to be any development at all except R&amp;D fishing expeditions by disconnected teams.

Now it looks like ""ETH 2"" is being abandoned and the focus is on optimistic rollups and a ""Plasma"" lightning-network again?

You can easily authenticate NFT ownership and track literally every transaction related to it.

You seem to not understand what Non Fungible actually means and how/why screenshotting or whatever else is irrelevant. 

Even if you screenshot, and do whatever other idiot-thing you want, it is still not a replacement of the original, and any copy holds zero properties that benefit the original.
