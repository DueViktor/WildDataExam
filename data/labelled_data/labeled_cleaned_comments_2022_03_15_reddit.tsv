This to say that nothing is really challenged, the theory holds true in the realm of R. Since BTC is not equivalent to R (real numbers), but more like a finite subset of N (integers from 0 to infinity) you can't have a geometric series unless you approximate the numbers that don't exists with numbers that exists. Since you approx with a lesser value, the sum is finite and less or equal to the value of the geometric series. There is nothing wrong with that, as a mathematical stand point.

But don't forget math is just a set of symbols and rules.  Change the symbols or rules, and you change the math.  2 + 2 = 4 seems like it should be universally true, but our unstated assumption is that we're working in Base 10.  If it turns out we're not working in Base 10, then 2 + 2 may equal something other than 4.

So if you change the universe of numbers you're dealing with (in this case, strictly integers), then you change the math.  Your assumption that you can subdivide a Satoshi while mining is incorrect, because those numbers simply don't exist in this application.

Same holds true with logic.  No one can agree on what the basic axioms are for philosophical or mathematical logic, even if you do specify a use case.  I've had people come to me thinking they have a solid proof in their hands, but I often disagree.  I reject bivalence as a logical axiom, and I'm not alone.  Others accept it.

1. He doesn't cover what happens when two people predict the same date, which is a big problem once we consider high profile people. They have a security detail, that tends to be good at their job, hence, you need insider knowledge to pull the job off. The guy who sells you the insider knowledge could just place a prediction themselves, thus ruining your payday.

2. The time of death could be obscured. Just say the dignitary was injured and is in the hospital (When in actuality, he's dead). Then predict his death for a week from now, and publish news of his death at that time. The assassin will lose out on his paycheck.

3. Predict, and fake the dignitarie's death. Claim the bounty. The assassination market can't get their money back. This is a counter to a counter to the above. If the ammount of proof the assassination market requires is too low to make the above effective, hit them with this until it either is, or they're bankrupt.

4. Blanket predict the dignitaries death, to guarantee that the assassin will have lose out on some of his or her pay.

5. Related to 1. a team of assassins could backstab each other by each predicting the death individually. This means that the assassin would have to work alone."	5f1e51e560b059859500ccc9c3e220e74e7c32b3	True	False					0.0	1647243072		0.0	{}	i0lbb5u	False	t3_td7nmz	False	True	t3_td7nmz	/r/Bitcoin/comments/td7nmz/bitcoin_assassination_markets_could_quickly_end/i0lbb5u/	1647243085.0	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]

It is also ridiculously naive (should we say ridiculously intentional?) to state that the PoW's characteristics may undermine Union and global efforts to achieve climate and sustainability goals, referring to BTC CO2 emissions (13ml metric tons from 1st January 2016 to 30 June 2018), at the same time that the EU's total CO2 emissions for 2020 were approximately¬†2.54 billion metric tons¬†of carbon dioxide emissions!

The only reason for them to say it is *urgent* to deploy more environmentally friendly solutions (consensus mechanisms) is that they CANNOT control PoW, while Proof of Stake, they can control. 

They are afraid of Bitcoin and the power it gives people, and that shows!

Not to mention the multitude of benefits that PoW (BTC) is able produce especially now in the Ukrainian / Russian war OR how it can battle the governments' corruption worldwide, as other redditors correctly put.

All the more to believe that this is another reason they do not want it to exist, perhaps the most important of them all."									1647238706			{}	i0l5xco	False	t3_tchz57	False	True	t3_tchz57	/r/Bitcoin/comments/tchz57/proof_of_work_ban_in_europe_call_to_action_engage/i0l5xco/		3		True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj				0	[]		[]	1665186370.0
