Hey everyone I could really use some help. Last year I was victim of fraud during a mental health crisis and some fraudsters made me buy eth on my name. I can’t remember how I got it and all I have is the wallet address: 0xd5624Df2B1a760fe83024A1094C0592a1C0416f4

I’ve just checked and the account has been used a lot and I’m afraid I might be in trouble in the future for this. Any ideas on how to recover the wallet?"	ethereum	2022_05_11	1	133	2022-11-26T22:54:42.186404Z	2022-11-26T22:54:42.186450Z	106.654	Support

Hope the community can help me with some perspective.   I know the whole point of the ETH merge is to move to proof of stake. So cool!

If you cant be your own validator and go with one of the popular staking options Rocketpool and get rETH. 

It's right to say your taking risks of the bridge being hacked and losing all your  ETH and could it happen that rETH depegs?

Is there a particular reason why Rocketpool is less vulnerable?"	ethereum	2022_08_26	1	73	2022-11-26T22:07:57.335364Z	2022-11-26T22:07:57.335411Z	74.07	"{""choices"": [""Knowledge"", ""Trust"", ""Identity""]}"

Dear DeFi enthusiasts and GMX fans

I have developed a GMX Staking Calculator which should simply show you how much esGMX + ETH Rewards you are earning from staking the GMX Token.

The GMX Calculator is based on live-data from the gmx exchange and uses the 7-day-average of fee revenue which gets distributed to GMX holders.

Check out the GMX Calculator: [GmxStaking.com](https://GmxStaking.com)
