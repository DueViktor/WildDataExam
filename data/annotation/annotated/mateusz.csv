61,Why is the majority of SOL not liquid staked?
Over 95% of staked SOL is delegated to individual validators instead of with a liquid stake pool. There are real risks to liquid
stake pools (risk of depeg namely) but also real risks to delegating to a single validator (slashing namely). So why is the proportion so skewed?

Dear DeFi enthusiasts and GMX fans

I have developed a GMX Staking Calculator which should simply show you how much esGMX + ETH Rewards you are earning from staking the GMX Token.

The GMX Calculator is based on live-data from the gmx exchange and uses the 7-day-average of fee revenue which gets distributed to GMX holders.

Check out the GMX Calculator: [GmxStaking.com](https://GmxStaking.com)

Please let me know any suggestions/feedback so I can improve the website or add new features!,ethereum,2022_08_26,1,76,2022-11-28T01:09:48.909414Z,2022-11-28T01:09:48.909452Z,35.374
73,Whats the Rockepool staking risk
Hope the community can help me with some perspective.   I know the whole point of the ETH merge is to move to proof of stake. So cool!

If you cant be your own validator and go with one of the popular staking options Rocketpool and get rETH. 

It's right to say your taking risks of the bridge being hacked and losing all your  ETH and could it happen that rETH depegs?

Is there a particular reason why Rocketpool is less vulnerable?,ethereum,2022_08_26,1,77,2022-11-28T01:10:19.037243Z,2022-11-28T01:10:19.037286Z,29.995
