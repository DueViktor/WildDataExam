Hey everyone I could really use some help. Last year I was victim of fraud during a mental health crisis and some fraudsters made me buy eth on my name. I can’t remember how I got it and all I have is the wallet address: 0xd5624Df2B1a760fe83024A1094C0592a1C0416f4

I’ve just checked and the account has been used a lot and I’m afraid I might be in trouble in the future for this.

It's right to say your taking risks of the bridge being hacked and losing all your  ETH and could it happen that rETH depegs?

Dear DeFi enthusiasts and GMX fans

I have developed a GMX Staking Calculator which should simply show you how much esGMX + ETH Rewards you are earning from staking the GMX Token.

The GMX Calculator is based on live-data from the gmx exchange and uses the 7-day-average of fee revenue which gets distributed to GMX holders.
