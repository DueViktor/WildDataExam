1.1 Reicht Ihnen nicht das es Notwendig war? So eine insgeheime Verwässerung eines Vermögenswertes nennt man Diebstahl!

2. Wenn eine Handvoll von Leuten es schaffen die Blockchain runter zu fahren. Ist es eine nicht vorhandene Dezentralisierung. 
Blockchain is all about decentralization!
Wo ist bitte noch der Vorteil von Solana im Vergleich zu Visa? Visa ist schneller, auf dem Markt etabliert und auch noch zuverlässiger.

2.2 Die Hardwareanforderung steigt je mehr Nodes es gibt. Jeder will was vom Kuchen abhaben und die aktuellen Validatoren werden aufrüsten um nicht weniger Einmahmen zu generieren. Durch deren „firstmover“ Vorteil haben diese auch die meisten Resourcen um dies zu bewerkstelligen. Wodurch sich neue Nodes entweder nur langsam oder eben garnicht mehr aufbauen werden.

3. Schlimm genug das es eine Tatsache ist. Wie gesagt. Solana war öffter offline als mein Handy…

4. Stimme ich zu das es net in der Verantwortung der Entwickler ist. Dennoch wurden Leute durch diese falschen Parameter in ein Investment gelockt, welches bei weitem nicht so erfolgreich ist wie propagiert. Und damit haben sich die Entwickler gebrüstet! Seien wir mal ehrlich, wenn die nur einwenig Ihre Codes verstehen, dann müssen die es doch auch irgendwann gemerkt haben dass mit dem traffic etwas net stimmen kann. Seis drum, Fakt ist. Der Angebliche Erfolg beruht auf einer Lüge.

5. Ebenfalls selbiges Argument wie in 4. Verschließen die Entwickler etwa auch hier ihre Augen?

6. Ich habe deswegen auch unterdurchschnittlich geschrieben. 
Weder bei Ethereum, Polkadot, Cardano noch Link ZUSAMMENGENOMMEN habe ich soviel Ignoranz und Unwissenheit erlebt. Nur EOS konnte mit dem Solana Niveau mithalten. Wo die jetzt sind können Sie selber nachschauen.

6.1 Offensichtlich haben Sie POS noch nicht so richtig verstanden. Was glauben Sie warum Solana so anfällig für ddos Angriffe ist?
Und so kann auch finanzieller Schaden entstehen:) Wenn Sie nicht wissen was ich meine, googlen Sie nach Regressansprüchen bei downtime von Serversystemen. Da können 1-2 Minuten schon in die Millionen gehen… Ganz zu schweigen von Stunden.


Ich war damals sehr interessiert an Solana, nach meinen Erfolgen bei Cardano, Ethereum und TheSandBoxGame sollte das mein nächstes Pferd im Stall werden.

2. Wo ist hier das Argument? Das ist lediglich eine Behauptung. Ja, Solana's Token-Verteilung ist zurzeit relativ zentralisiert, jedoch wird das sich im Lauf der Jahre normalisieren.
2.2 Das genaue Gegenteil ist hier der Fall. Die Hardwareanforderungen an Validators werden nicht merkbar steigen, während Hardware von Jahr zu Jahr um etwa 30-40% billiger wird.
3. Tatsache
4. Nicht Verantwortung der Blockchain. Gelogen wird immer und überall. Möglicherweise werden der Öffentlichkeit präsentierte Daten nur oberflächlich überprüft/nicht sachgemäss bereinigt. Das wars dann auch schon, da die Daten an sich auf der Blockchain öffentlich einsehbar sind. 
5. Selbiges wie 4.
6. Nicht untypisch für Blockchain communities. Solana ist hier keine Ausnahme. Die smarten Leute versuchen möglichst ihre Zeit nicht mit Idioten zu verschwenden, dementsprechend selten lassen sie sich hier blicken.
6.1 Ja Solana benutzt PoS consensus. Leute, die etwas anderes behaupten, haben die Solana zugrundeliegenden Mechanismen nicht verstanden. Dies scheint jedoch auch bei dir der Fall zu sein, da deine Analogie mit Geldtransporten wenig Sinn macht. Solana's PoH dient lediglich dazu parallele Transaktionsverarbeitung zu ermöglichen, da durch den Timestamp alle Transaktionen chronologisch korrekt in die Böcke eingeordnet werden können, was ansonsten nicht möglich wäre. Geldtransporte können überfallen werden - ein ähnliches Gefahrenpotenzial scheint mir im Fall von Blockchains zu fehlen (?)"	e5a4f468880ad82e64aa0c7983ee48662c808e41	True	False					0	1660154413		0	{}	ijqyggw	False	t3_wk6dqk	False	True	t1_ijqiflm	/r/solana/comments/wk6dqk/how_can_the_nasdaq_run_on_this_if_it_always_gets/ijqyggw/	1660154429	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]		1 das ist ein alter hase welcher dazumals hinreichend publiziert ausgenommen und schlussendlich gekl rt worden ist das zur cksetzen der blockchain im falle des dao hacks l sst solana neben ethereum wie ein weisenkind aussehen 1 1 inwiefern die max supply wurde dementsprechend angepasst 2 wo ist hier das argument das ist lediglich eine behauptung ja solana s token verteilung ist zurzeit relativ zentralisiert jedoch wird das sich im lauf der jahre normalisieren 2 2 das genaue gegenteil ist hier der fall die hardwareanforderungen an validators werden nicht merkbar steigen w hrend hardware von jahr zu jahr um etwa 30 40 billiger wird 3 tatsache 4 nicht verantwortung der blockchain gelogen wird immer und berall m glicherweise werden der ffentlichkeit pr sentierte daten nur oberfl chlich berpr ft nicht sachgem ss bereinigt das wars dann auch schon da die daten an sich auf der blockchain ffentlich einsehbar sind 5 selbiges wie 4 6 nicht untypisch f r blockchain communities solana ist hier keine ausnahme die smarten leute versuchen m glichst ihre zeit nicht mit idioten zu verschwenden dementsprechend selten lassen sie sich hier blicken 6 1 ja solana benutzt pos consensus leute die etwas anderes behaupten haben die solana zugrundeliegenden mechanismen nicht verstanden dies scheint jedoch auch bei dir der fall zu sein da deine analogie mit geldtransporten wenig sinn macht solana s poh dient lediglich dazu parallele transaktionsverarbeitung zu erm glichen da durch den timestamp alle transaktionen chronologisch korrekt in die b cke eingeordnet werden k nnen was ansonsten nicht m glich w re geldtransporte k nnen berfallen werden ein hnliches gefahrenpotenzial scheint mir im fall von blockchains zu fehlen 	0.0008775978349149227	0.9950078725814819	0.5245999693870544	0.04086695984005928	0.0036530543584376574	0.03408762812614441	0.41757264733314514	8.500846320202982e-07	0.438952773809433	0.00020418698841240257

I'm very biased against exchange validators (binance, coinbase, kraken) which have historically had below average network performance and contribute little tbh. I don't know of any wallet related validators that contribute meaningfully either. They just horde high amounts of stake. For contributions you can get a better sense from contributors in the solana discord (mb validators channel and others), sometimes from reddit, and also a bit from twitter (anatoly is happy to tweet about validator contributions).

For reliability I'd look at uptime on stakewiz. Security is not that much of a concern for stakers.. the security is all the same given that there's no slashing. If a validator is hacked and goes delinquent or sets commission to 100% the only risk is your rewards stopping.

Die Qualität meines Posts ist dem Qualitätsniveau des Solana Projekts angemessen.

Wie so oft muss ich die Verfehlungen des Solanaprojektes aufzählen. Weil es so viele sind geschieht dies nur Stichpunktartig.

1. Secret Wallet
1.1 Fake max supply
2. Fake Dezentralisierung
2.2 Immer teurer werdende Hardware für die Nodes
3. Offlinezeiten und Restarts
4. Fake DeFi traffic
5. Wahrscheinlich auch Fake NFT traffic
6. Unterdurchschnittliche „Community-Intelligenz“
6.1 Solana user/investoren wollten mir wirklich Erklären Solana benutzt POH und kein POS🤣🤣🤣
Wenn ich Ihnen das jetzt auch noch erklären muss dann wird es wirklich traurig…

The [rate of inflation](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-staking#inflation)and staking rewards are also variable based on the staking rate (i.e., what percentage of total issuance of all DOT is staked), which will obviously vary based on people's opinions of if they should stake or not.

The [Polkadot-JS App Targets page](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/staking/targets) provides estimates, but these are just that, estimates.

If you want to know how much you have received in the past, you can view your actual staking rewards using most block explorers (e.g. [Subscan](https://polkadot.subscan.io/)) and calculate it.

This has some [specific ramifications](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-accounts#existential-deposit-and-reaping), but mostly you can just use it again with no problems.

It's important to remember that account addresses consist of two major parts: the network identifier which indicates which chain (parachain, relay chain, some other solochain, or whatever) you are referring to, and the public key itself. So by changing the network identifier, you can re-use the public key on multiple chains, but the address will appear different. For example, my BILL account on Polkadot is 16frLykgLH5w8pNsvzEMTzCESMpLqWJMr4SGJUJQgYniDzdb, but on Kusama it is JFArxqV6rqPSwBok3zQDnj5jL6vwsZQDwYXXqb1cFygnYVt. But both of these are the exact same public key and so are essentially the ""same account""  - they just have a different network identifier.

They are now live on Kusama, and should be rolled out on Polkadot soon, although I can't give an estimate. They allow nominators to pool funds together and act as a single nominator account. This reduces the minimum bonding amount significantly, and will hopefully become more of a set-and-forget method for those who don't wish to research validators on their own.
