Don't bother. To really care about something, people need to be tricked into thinking it was their own idea. Like *Inception* or *A Christmas Story*. That's my initial reaction. But for all I know, you could be having great discussions and he could have an interest in what you have to say so...


&gt;~~Lands~~ Countries will just follow China and in the end Bitcoin will be fully banned everywhere.


We're seeing this unfold now. Take a look into the China and India situation and look into the El Salvador situation. And look into the US and Europe situation.


Note the differences in Government and economies. It's opinion but I see China as controlling. So they ban Bitcoin. El Salvador is a nation with a lot of issues and desperation. So they are trying Bitcoin as something new. The US wants to remain a technological power. So they will not be banning Bitcoin. They will try to regulate it and we see a clashing of money laundering laws and restrictions with growth of industries that are going to be US-first.


And there it is. Not every country will ban it because wealthy companies have already come to fruition. Companies control the western governments through lobbying and they have enough money to lobby now. Just look at those ads. This isn't the days of Mt. Gox.


&gt;If the internet ever gets shut down because for example of a big world war then Bitcoin would become useless.


The strawman, of course, is that we'd have bigger problems these days if something like this happened, especially considering the satellites these days. Hell, Ukraine still has internet and they're being fucking bombed by Russia. It would have to be a goddamn big war to knock out all internet everywhere.


Even if internet everywhere is knocked out, P2P networks like Loranet can't be stopped. Radio communication could still be used to keep the blockchain moving, albeit there might be some chain splits if it becomes too fragmented.


But, like, google bitcoin satellite. Some organization launched a satellite just for that."	a308f3eed516bc25d9b74d9c472884a4b1e081d0	True	False					0	1650859195		0	{}	i637vww	False	t3_uaa7rv	False	True	t3_uaa7rv	/r/Bitcoin/comments/uaa7rv/my_dad_doesnt_believe_in_bitcoin_his_arguments/i637vww/	1650859209	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]			 gt i m very bad at explaining and i don t really have solid understandable answers for him so i was wondering if maybe you guys have some good counter arguments i could use keep in mind he s 70 years old and believes fully in gold he doesn t own any though don t bother to really care about something people need to be tricked into thinking it was their own idea like inception or a christmas story that s my initial reaction but for all i know you could be having great discussions and he could have an interest in what you have to say so gt lands countries will just follow china and in the end bitcoin will be fully banned everywhere we re seeing this unfold now take a look into the china and india situation and look into the el salvador situation and look into the us and europe situation note the differences in government and economies it s opinion but i see china as controlling so they ban bitcoin el salvador is a nation with a lot of issues and desperation so they are trying bitcoin as something new the us wants to remain a technological power so they will not be banning bitcoin they will try to regulate it and we see a clashing of money laundering laws and restrictions with growth of industries that are going to be us first and there it is not every country will ban it because wealthy companies have already come to fruition companies control the western governments through lobbying and they have enough money to lobby now just look at those ads this isn t the days of mt gox gt if the internet ever gets shut down because for example of a big world war then bitcoin would become useless the strawman of course is that we d have bigger problems these days if something like this happened especially considering the satellites these days hell ukraine still has internet and they re being fucking bombed by russia it would have to be a goddamn big war to knock out all internet everywhere even if internet everywhere is knocked out p2p networks like loranet can t be stopped radio communication could still be used to keep the blockchain moving albeit there might be some chain splits if it becomes too fragmented but like google bitcoin satellite some organization launched a satellite just for that 	0.0027110131923109293	0.9883370995521545	0.302772581577301	0.934579074382782	0.9942179918289185	0.42271411418914795	0.08180567622184753	8.409976999246283e-07	0.3770765960216522	0.005175340920686722

You can pay me to take your bitcoin off your hands anytime! That’s what your question actually implies.

In traditional finance, if you long something with leverage using a margin account (borrowed money) and it goes down enough (or go short and it goes up) you can be margin called and actual owe more than you invested, but in crypto futures markets the exchanges use liquidations to avoid margin calls, so not possible this way either. But this is for traders only and they are not even buying, just betting on the price with futures so it is not of concern to regular plebs who just buy bitcoin.

Futures markets can do some quirky things, like the price of oil going negative, but that was because it was physically settled futures so people were paying others to take these futures contracts off their hands because they didn’t want, or even probably couldn’t actually take physical delivery of the oil futures they had bought.

We would disagree. But if you are here to ""fix"" Bitcoin because of its power use, then you don't understand Bitcoin or the point of it.


What you are talking about is separate from Bitcoin, however. This is all about where the cheapest power in every region on earth comes from because that is what people will use to mine with. In most cases, it's not exactly ramped up or ramped down ""for"" bitcoin miners. It's not Bitcoin that's environmentally damaging; it's the power sources.


&gt;Why isn’t there a mining setup that involves solar panels and a great battery


On a small-scale, you could easily do this yourself. But the cost of your solar setup will be more expensive than the miners.


On a large scale, this would be an interesting idea for a solar farm for excess power (production varies a LOT) but then the farm would still have to eat the initial cost of the miners as well as the setup.


&gt;Could anyone point me to one?


This isn't like a thing where you buy a mining setup that involves solar and a battery. You buy the equipment to set up a solar powerplant, then you run your miners on it.


There's a lot of hobby solar enthusiasts. Check out ""Will Prowse"" on youtube. He's done a lot of experimentation and has good explanations of the various components of a solar setup.


Your largest difficulty will be sizing. Since you are running a 24-7 miner, you will need a large battery bank and batteries tend to take up the bulk of the cost in a system. Your panels would have to be oversized as well.

Where are you getting this figure from? It sounds wildly wrong. The cows i drive past in the hills near Lismore are quite happily eating grass not to mention that the trees on the hills remain in place and no artificial fertilizer needs to be produced and trucked in to feed them. 

As for farmed crops there are many environmental issues the Haber-Bosch process being one of them due to it's massive energy requirements.

The price is high. If the “bubble” that some people think it’s in pops, you could see it go back down to 10-15k. If you want to buy some, then that’s your decision. But I’d personally do like 33% Bitcoin, 33% S&amp;P/401k safe investments, and 33% on some companies you believe in. Something along those lines. I definitely wouldn’t bet 1/3rd of my total investment amount on Bitcoin though. 

I get it sucks feeling like you’re missing out on the hype train, but the price is high. That’s objectively true. It’s higher than the prices it has historically stayed at the longest. This isn’t “the dip” people would typically be waiting for.

I once did something similar to what you are saying. First, I had to spend hours researching the best encryption method and decide on my password. I came to a few realizations:

* The seed then is only as secure as your password. A good complex password is... You know what makes a great password? 12 words. Oh wait.
* If you are going to memorize a complex password, memorize the damn seed instead. If you are going to write the complex password down, write down the seed instead!
* your memory absolutely can fail you so whether or not you implement a password, you need to write something down in clear text. May as well make it your seed and keep it secure.

I fully understand the true value of bitcoin.  But I also think that the old adage is true that ""markets can remain irrational a lot longer than you and I can remain solvent.""  The global financial system has behaved irrationally and been a corrupt, manipulated, systemically sick cancer for a lot longer than any of us have been alive.

I think it's irresponsible to claim with certainty or suggest it is a foregone conclusion that it will transform the world and global finance, that hyperbitcoinization will happen and it will become the world's reserve currency.  I truly hope it DOES do that and I certainly think it has the POTENTIAL to do that.  However, at this point, I'd say it's still a 50/50 chance that doesn't happen with Bitcoin.  I would put the probability that the US/global stock market goes to zero at a much, much lower number.

If bitcoin goes to zero, I'm not fucked because I don't have 100% allocation into it.  If the US/global market goes to zero, then we're ALL fucked - regardless of what Bitcoin does.  I have just enough into bitcoin so that if it becomes a 100Tn asset class, I'll do well.  And if it tanks to Zero, yeah it'll hurt, but I'll get over it and will move on with life.

Anyway,


Why the USB and laptop? Why not pen and paper? You're just looking at them offline. You're basically overcomplicating a password book.


It is debatable whether or not you should be storing your passwords the way you are. But if it works for you, and you can keep both the USB and laptop secure, then I have learned over the years that that means that that is perhaps the best method for you, to prevent loss.


*Do not treat the seed like a password*. It is much more than that. It is the password, the username and the login page all in one place. Any leak and all your money is gone with no 2FA to block it and no online form to reset your password and no email notification that someone accessed it.


Security is all a balance. The ledger is the primary and the access. The paper is the backup in case the ledger dies. Usually this is stored in your home, in a method that is secure but you won't lose it. The third backup that you mention is basically in case your home floods or burns down or gets nuked while you are on vacation. Options here all have their downsides but include a second physical location on paper, dedicated memorization (note: don't do this without a home paper) or a subtle physical item you carry. There are risks in all of them that are down to the person but no matter who you are you shouldn't have it on a USB you regularly plug into a computer that ever goes online.


Importantly, however, you need to at least be treating the offline laptop the same as the USB. Store is just as securely. There may be temporary files you don't know about.


&gt;how do you guys save your passwords?


Nice try.


Lol in all seriousness, though the best method depends on the person. I have observed old people had books until about 10 years ago, when they seemed to move to whatever notetaking app their phone has.


I recommend the books. I do NOT recommend the notetaking app unless you at least encode it in a way only you can understand. Heck, that'd be a good idea to do for the notebook, too. Balancing security for people with bad memories is difficult when the most important thing is to avoid password reuse.

Because of many factors, the dollar prices of homes have steadily climbed, the price of stocks have steadily climbed, the prices of most commodities are increasing, etc. The cost of homes priced in Bitcoin have dropped over the last 10 years. Does the real estate property actually have more or less economic value now versus 10 years ago? No, typically real estate has the same economic potential now versus 10 years ago: people can live there or do work there, same then as now. An acre of land is still dirt, plants, etc. The dollar price increases we see have a lot to do with currency debasement. The increased price is not so much about 'an acre can be used to create more economic value now versus 10 years ago'. In his extended interviews, Michael Saylor explains this far more elegantly and more clearly than I am able to in a Reddit comment. His interview with Lex Fridman is probably the clearest and most accessible explanation I have ever heard on the differences between the economic values of fiat currencies and Bitcoin.	123a98fa3a663f244f7f8386d40d1300a2311757	True	False					0	1650854368		0	{}	i62yihe	False	t3_ub152p	False	True	t1_i62q1p7	/r/Bitcoin/comments/ub152p/breaking_the_central_african_republic_became_the/i62yihe/	1650854384	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]			over the last 10 years the value of the dollar has been unstable in the downward and bad direction while bitcoin has been unstable in the upward and good direction because of many factors the dollar prices of homes have steadily climbed the price of stocks have steadily climbed the prices of most commodities are increasing etc the cost of homes priced in bitcoin have dropped over the last 10 years does the real estate property actually have more or less economic value now versus 10 years ago no typically real estate has the same economic potential now versus 10 years ago people can live there or do work there same then as now an acre of land is still dirt plants etc the dollar price increases we see have a lot to do with currency debasement the increased price is not so much about an acre can be used to create more economic value now versus 10 years ago in his extended interviews michael saylor explains this far more elegantly and more clearly than i am able to in a reddit comment his interview with lex fridman is probably the clearest and most accessible explanation i have ever heard on the differences between the economic values of fiat currencies and bitcoin 	0.0006128025124780834	0.9957488179206848	0.39527350664138794	0.9736267328262329	0.9973652958869934	0.006452069152146578	0.14553876221179962	8.36604442611133e-07	0.5056020021438599	7.412283594021574e-06

248	[]	False		Vunha			[]				text	t2_171z5r	False	False	"&gt;The OP is trying to construct some huge narrative built on their ignorance of how hardware wallets function. There is not much reason to respond to their theme without more specific questions. Most of everything they said to downplay hardware wallets was wrong.

No, i know how they work in concept. One of my hobbies is general embedded work, so other than the deep implementation of the security elements (of which the ledger's is closed source, which is something to worry about depending on paranoia) i don't think there is much left to know how hardware wallets work superficially, even if you are an average person; they have a security element that enables them to sign transactions without the private key ever leaving it, which together with on-device pin entry makes a package that offers great security.

This post wasn't supposed to downplay hardware wallets, it was just my rationale on why they aren't *that* needed. Of which, funnily enough, you didn't manage to explain in a way that, from the post's point of view, doesn't fit either in the whale (which is an outlier) or paranoid (gimmick) since no elaboration on *why* is it so dangerous for the average crypto user to not have a hardware wallet was done other than affirmations that are to be taken at face value, since other than the big ""i have a ton of assets and stored my seed phrase/private key in plaintext for some reason"" post that happens once in a while, i don't see enough of a security epidemic amongst us to warrant the apparent amount of people using hardware wallets nowadays other than the instances i've listed, which doesn't seem to account for a lot of people in raw numbers other than the gimmick case (there aren't that many whales and people using crypto IRL to warrant that many people using hardware wallets, i think)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I think it's insane to store your private keys on any device wasn't built to wall your keys off. Especially if they keys access accounts that contain value too painful to lose.

Aren't most devices nowadays *made* to wall important information off? A ton of crypto users are linux power users and/or know enough about programming and technology to know how to either A: keep their computer secure or B: secure their keys themselves.

But obviously i could be wrong in my perception (and this is why i made the post: i can't conceive of any other credible situation where hardware wallets are good investments other than the ones i listed on my post) and there may be a ton more not-so-tech-savvy users in crypto than my ""programmer that uses thinkpad and encrypts partition with LUKS"" point of view may enable me to perceive, but this is just a clarification away, not a ""ignore OP he dumb"" response.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I see no downside in hardware wallets. Transaction confirmation is a feature not a bug.

One of the downsides is the fact that it is a product that you have to buy, that for you may not be a big expense but for some people (such as those that live on third world countries with a weak currency, like me) may be prohibitive and warrant a reconsideration. 

And continuing, having to confirm every transaction by entering the pin instead of just signing like in Frame may be a feature for you, but it's still an UX obstacle for some."	9876a57c7c4fa230c49ce92e1c6050af21069225	True	False					0	1650851089		0	{}	i62rkb7	True	t3_ub8cb2	False	True	t1_i62l5m5	/r/ethereum/comments/ub8cb2/is_your_hardware_wallet_a_gimmick_or_a_necessity/i62rkb7/	1650851106	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]			 gt the op is trying to construct some huge narrative built on their ignorance of how hardware wallets function there is not much reason to respond to their theme without more specific questions most of everything they said to downplay hardware wallets was wrong no i know how they work in concept one of my hobbies is general embedded work so other than the deep implementation of the security elements of which the ledger s is closed source which is something to worry about depending on paranoia i don t think there is much left to know how hardware wallets work superficially even if you are an average person they have a security element that enables them to sign transactions without the private key ever leaving it which together with on device pin entry makes a package that offers great security this post wasn t supposed to downplay hardware wallets it was just my rationale on why they aren t that needed of which funnily enough you didn t manage to explain in a way that from the post s point of view doesn t fit either in the whale which is an outlier or paranoid gimmick since no elaboration on why is it so dangerous for the average crypto user to not have a hardware wallet was done other than affirmations that are to be taken at face value since other than the big i have a ton of assets and stored my seed phrase private key in plaintext for some reason post that happens once in a while i don t see enough of a security epidemic amongst us to warrant the apparent amount of people using hardware wallets nowadays other than the instances i ve listed which doesn t seem to account for a lot of people in raw numbers other than the gimmick case there aren t that many whales and people using crypto irl to warrant that many people using hardware wallets i think amp x200b gt i think it s insane to store your private keys on any device wasn t built to wall your keys off especially if they keys access accounts that contain value too painful to lose aren t most devices nowadays made to wall important information off a ton of crypto users are linux power users and or know enough about programming and technology to know how to either a keep their computer secure or b secure their keys themselves but obviously i could be wrong in my perception and this is why i made the post i can t conceive of any other credible situation where hardware wallets are good investments other than the ones i listed on my post and there may be a ton more not so tech savvy users in crypto than my programmer that uses thinkpad and encrypts partition with luks point of view may enable me to perceive but this is just a clarification away not a ignore op he dumb response amp x200b gt i see no downside in hardware wallets transaction confirmation is a feature not a bug one of the downsides is the fact that it is a product that you have to buy that for you may not be a big expense but for some people such as those that live on third world countries with a weak currency like me may be prohibitive and warrant a reconsideration and continuing having to confirm every transaction by entering the pin instead of just signing like in frame may be a feature for you but it s still an ux obstacle for some 	0.0026133956853300333	0.9889774918556213	0.6257728934288025	0.017072461545467377	0.00833417009562254	0.5370270013809204	0.07379600405693054	8.43275358874962e-07	0.26921528577804565	0.0037080226466059685

(1) 

How do you actualize 

&gt; -&gt; `fractional ownership`

For your employees in a SEC context? 

Note:

*Feel free* *to answer as asked* 

&gt; *""how are you""*
&gt;
&gt;  ||
&gt;
&gt;  *""how am I""*

Instead.

-----

(2)

How are you purchasing the subdomains?

Ie 

- One registration?

- One address for your ens token's holding?

- One top-level dns conversion?

- Account to hold individual identities?

I've made attempts myself to expand on my one token. 

As an overall identity like normal use case. 

However, reaching what you have outlined. Appears to be maybe not a possibility. For my usage. While retaining that identity level structure.

Possibly interpret ^ context as 

- ""Personal"" vs ""Business"" 

  Accounts || Structures

- Verification (signature, notorized documents, etc) 

  vs

  Barrier to ""Self"" (LLC type uses)

-----

Your use case is exactly what I believe this protocol is capable of. 

I think how your going to structure it as you've outlined. While deviant from a personal entity level.

With IPFS could be plug-in-play within an 'entity' structure. (Ie myself using mine to be myself)

Even more with the simplified methodology for payments. That you present with your business.

I've kind of got mine configured to be a repository of self. 

For -&gt; medical purposes, RD&amp;T.

Using 

- Pinata 

To provide decentralized pins &amp;&amp; access internationally.

In doing so... I've possibly locked myself out of what you've prototyped. 

Even when that's not my intention.

Nor do I believe its the intention of the community. To exclude either or.

Equity holding could be even more valued to businesses. If we can succeed in both. 

Especially with royalties like expressed. You could even in your business pick up and let go employees.

Almost as if they carry with them associated vested customer services. 

Ie 

- A financial product 

- Or client access 

- ""Network Growth"" per ""acquisition"" of 'employee entity' level royalties 

  ^ By blockchain client list/ens associated business

Personally, I would like to see that under an ENS token for each person. 

So I guess that explicitly is my context for the ^ above two questions."	eba17995d58fb17bc0bef6fa458d81241acb779f	True	False					0	1650872905		0	{}	i63rtll	False	t3_uaea2d	False	True	t1_i5zafkp	/r/ethereum/comments/uaea2d/i_bought_an_ens_domain/i63rtll/	1650872919	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]			question 1 how do you actualize gt gt fractional ownership for your employees in a sec context note feel free to answer as asked gt how are you gt gt gt gt how am i instead 2 how are you purchasing the subdomains ie one registration one address for your ens token s holding one top level dns conversion account to hold individual identities i ve made attempts myself to expand on my one token as an overall identity like normal use case however reaching what you have outlined appears to be maybe not a possibility for my usage while retaining that identity level structure possibly interpret context as personal vs business accounts structures verification signature notorized documents etc vs barrier to self llc type uses your use case is exactly what i believe this protocol is capable of i think how your going to structure it as you ve outlined while deviant from a personal entity level with ipfs could be plug in play within an entity structure ie myself using mine to be myself even more with the simplified methodology for payments that you present with your business i ve kind of got mine configured to be a repository of self for gt medical purposes rd amp t using pinata to provide decentralized pins amp amp access internationally in doing so i ve possibly locked myself out of what you ve prototyped even when that s not my intention nor do i believe its the intention of the community to exclude either or equity holding could be even more valued to businesses if we can succeed in both especially with royalties like expressed you could even in your business pick up and let go employees almost as if they carry with them associated vested customer services ie a financial product or client access network growth per acquisition of employee entity level royalties by blockchain client list ens associated business personally i would like to see that under an ens token for each person so i guess that explicitly is my context for the above two questions 	0.002259338740259409	0.9884500503540039	0.2389563024044037	0.9175301194190979	0.008422103710472584	0.5120801329612732	0.08359064906835556	8.394936230615713e-07	0.38585129380226135	0.0033810087479650974

Some NFT's are like domain names, and translate your crypto addresses to something easy to remember.

Other NFT's are more a community thing, ownership indicates that you're a member of the community and may give you access to exclusive (parts of) the community.

In the case of art it's often a way to support the artist that created the NFT, and sometimes it may create a bond between the buyer and artist, and maybe other fans of the artist and the artwork.

Another example are the NFT's that were sold to donate to the devs that made EIP1559 possible. I guess that's partly a community thing, but mostly a more fun and easy way to donate and express support.

NFT's can also be utilized as tickets, like the GET protocol (and, in case you're worried about transaction costs, this is perfectly suitable to run on an L2 or sidechain).

My main fear is usually making some kind of copy/paste error. Cryptocurrency addresses all look very similar at a glance to my primitive ape brain, so when I'm pasting an address into a dapp I check back and forth repeatedly before I'm reassured I got the right one. I'm extra paranoid about it because I know there are viruses out there that monitor your clipboard for things that look like cryptocurrency addresses and silently substitute their own. I run a pretty tight ship but there's always zero-day exploits churning around out there that even the best of us can fall for.
