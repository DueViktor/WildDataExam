If you wanted to donate some money and build shelters you'd be able to do twice as much good if you just did nothing for a few years first and let the interest compound. If you blow your whole load at once and let institutions make that interest instead of you, likely a lot less good comes of it.

Morals are hard whenever money is involved. You have to be part psychopath to get anything done in our society.

Like I'm basically poor so getting take-out is a huge treat to me. On my drive home I pass massive homeless encampments, and I take issue with myself for not stopping and giving all my food away, or picking extra food up to give out. I can't afford it so I never try, but that sourness inside me ruins any meal because obviously I can afford $3 more so it was just another choice I made to play my role in society. I feel like if I had 10,000x as much wealth I'd still feel the same..

At the bottom, we have the consensus layer, responsible for coordinating everything within the Ethereum network, somewhat making it Ethereum's L0. The consensus layer is comprised of the beacon chain, which is a blockchain that manages secondary blockchains, called shards, as well as validator responsibilities and accounts for Ethereum's proof-of-stake implementation.

On top of the consensus layer is the execution layer and the data layer, both combined representing Ethereum's L1. Both exist alongside each other, and are tied to and managed by the consensus layer via the beacon chain. Both are comprised of a set of shards (secondary blockchains), with the execution layer being a single shard that is capable of processing and executing transactions, and the data layer being a set of other shards that are solely meant to store data.

This is where Ethereum itself ends, and Ethereum-powered applications begin. Everything powered by Ethereum will reside in the execution and data layers, including all user accounts, transactions, smart contracts, etc. Ethereum may expand either of these two L1 layers, but this expansion still happens only within Ethereum's L1, no further up the stack.

On top of both the execution and data layers is the realm of L2s. L2s are not Ethereum, they're separate networks that run alongside Ethereum, while relying on Ethereum for their storage and security. Within the execution and data layers is an Ethereum-powered application, that acts as an anchor for this separate network, keeping it tied to and managed by Ethereum via this application.

This separate network may process transactions on its own, it may even go down, but this anchor means that all data within the network, including user accounts and transactions, resides in Ethereum, and hence the next level of the stack, in the realm of L2s.

So, to recap, starting from the bottom, we have:

&gt;The incentive structure of staking rewards already incentivize client diversity and decentralization. More specifically the disincentives do

This is word salad and aktshually technically correct. Yes, of course staking penalties inherently exist. I was not talking about that. In the same we can say there is an incentive to torrent de facto with a seeding/leeching incentive, but the fact remains there was no true incentive for seeding. Blockchain solutions like filecoin et al are doing that now.

This is a very disingenuous way to say that incentives do not exist, which is the point of my post, and strikes me as head-on-the-sand, ""we cannot improve the system"" mentality.

&gt;The problem is Prysm is too good of a client with superior business-ready tech so now we're in this client diversity mess

Agreed! Hmm..... if only there was some way to incentivize diversity....

&gt;but exchanges and staking-as-a-serviec providers should know it's really in their best interest to switch because they'd get massively slash if a Prysm bugged block got finalized and rejected by other clients.

Indeed, but we can internalize this externality further by rewarding marginal diversity.

&gt;In the end, the base protocol is a protocol, so it can't know who is implementing it and with what client. All the data you could think of to fingerprint a client could trivially be faked.

This just isn't true, and strikes me as sour grapes

&gt;Plus there's not a limited set of client implementations, in theory you could code your own client that implements the spec and use that one to stake just fine. In a perfect decentralized utopia that's what everyone would do, but obviously that's not at all practical.

Indeed! Hmmm, imagine some sort of incentive structure for client diversity, paramaterized for key metrics. 

&gt;So the next-best utopia is each implementation having less than a third of the stake.

Yes and 2% fixed is the perfect inflation rate because of reasons.

Many of the ""problems"" op correctly identified are addressed with a diversity incentive structure, but he seems to busy trying not to think about it.

They are also really active on the subreddit and has a long history of being very helpful on this sub and on the Solana discord.

One down side is they already have a really high stake amount that puts them in the super minority, i.e. they are part of the top 20 validators that could theoretically collude and halt consensus.

One mitigating factor is Shinobi systems has shown some really strong community values and seems like the last person who would want to damage solana so I personally don‚Äôt see an issue for optimizing your own returns by staking with them.

You could also consider spreading your stake. We run a validator with 0% commission and are working towards having the same return levels as Shinobi. Would always appreciate a portion of your stake.

But if i'd just want to address some of solana's advantages over ADA, i'd say:

1) the transaction fee in solana is basically zero.
Personally, i've never paid more than a penny for a SOL gas fee. But on ADA, the transaction fee is around 30,40 cents which is tens of times more than solana.

2) solana can currently make around 60,000 transaction per second (TPS) on its blockchain which is extremely fast, and they are planning to increase it to 600,000.
Cardano can only handle around 300 TPS.
(Etherium is around 30!)

3) the NFT market place on solana's blockchain is increasing way faster than cardano's nft marketplace which directly affects its price at the moment. 
Solana is also going to be added to opensea as a new cryptocurrency for nft trading which I believe (it's not an advice) is going to increase its price as soon as it gets added.

4) and one the main differences is the PoH (proof of history) which solana uses as a new technology which cardano doesn't."				1644827981	{}	hwvzt0r	False	t3_srpsf2	False	True	t3_srpsf2	/r/solana/comments/srpsf2/solana_vs_cardano/hwvzt0r/		1	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n		0	[]		False	2ccf9c69c89e1090ea9ab0a413b7c0d31ff05b25	True	False		0.0		0.0	1644827997.0	False	r/solana	public	first of all i think they are both one of the best long term investments in the crypto world but if i d just want to address some of solana s advantages over ada i d say 1 the transaction fee in solana is basically zero personally i ve never paid more than a penny for a sol gas fee but on ada the transaction fee is around 30 40 cents which is tens of times more than solana 2 solana can currently make around 60 000 transaction per second tps on its blockchain which is extremely fast and they are planning to increase it to 600 000 cardano can only handle around 300 tps etherium is around 30 3 the nft market place on solana s blockchain is increasing way faster than cardano s nft marketplace which directly affects its price at the moment solana is also going to be added to opensea as a new cryptocurrency for nft trading which i believe it s not an advice is going to increase its price as soon as it gets added 4 and one the main differences is the poh proof of history which solana uses as a new technology which cardano doesn t 	0.0024697573389858007	0.988728404045105	0.30871450901031494	0.03927062451839447	0.9947185516357422	0.5195598602294922	0.09323696792125702	8.474780770484358e-07	0.49309852719306946	0.0068856459110975266

I understand that this is how LP‚Äôs work, but again, the effect of mSOL compared to regular SOL is then halved, plus you get the risk of impermanent loss and/or the volatility of another token too.

So everyone should consider them and spread some stake to them.  But just be aware that commission is not the whole story; APY is what should matter to stakers.  Shinobi Systems earns 2% commission but ALSO earns more for its stakers than any 0% commission validator, because of higher performance of the validator that translates into more returns for stakers.

If you stake with Shinobi Systems both you and the validator earn more.  If you stake elsewhere, you earn less and the validator earns less.
