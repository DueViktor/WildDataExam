Then it went to 60k and people started asking for my advice, while ignoring it and losing money buying shitcoins and doing leverage trades. It crashes and people blame you or they simply hate you for not fucking up like they did and it becomes a hierarchy pissing contest of who has the most wealth.

I didn't find their answers the most enlightening, but I concluded at the time that the only thing that was an issue was that they do take on risk if we take our first income via lightning until we make our first payment because they cover the cost to open a channel until we can cover it with fees.

Phoenix wallet uses virtual channels to solve this (to allow you to receive money without first opening a channel), as well as charging a opening fee on your first deposit and capping the allowed amount for your first deposit. I wouldn't be surprised if muun did the same.

Either way, this problem is temporary but goes away with a bit of use.

Double spend doesn't happen if the miners are working. Someone owning more than 51% of the miners would be a danger. But they'd be wasting their fortune if they tried to kill Bitcoin with that. 
Most miners are pools though, and there's a new (upcoming?) Fork? patch? Con n that will allow individual miners to vote whatever they want even while in big pools. Which can help with this problem.

Human civilisation has been \*grinding\* for hundreds/thousands of years to get to this form of currency/asset after all their futile attempts. Never before did our ancestors have somewhere to channel their labour/value that was objectively scarce, safe, sound, easy to use &amp; move, and free of any governments or their borders. 

No government can stop it. No central bank can inflate it. No thief can burgle it from you, and If you're smart, no hacker can ever get to it. By being objectively neutral, immutable and away from the physical space, we've finally got there: a property that we truly own and can't be ruined by these assholes. While we may have tax, your property can no longer rot or expire - your value can, and increasingly will, be safe.

Although we're seeing the value pump and dumb with a slow march upwards, fiat is \*guaranteed\* to go down. That says one thing: if you buy bitcoin, your value will either stabilise against inflation on average at worst, or it'll increase at best. with further adoption and greater technological innovations (e.g. lightning) the odds of bitcoin being supreme (which are already huge) are just going up and up too. 

Be brave. Don't let those assholes scare you off.

After you get that SOL into Phantom, please consider staking with BlazeStake ([stake.solblaze.org](https://stake.solblaze.org)), it's super intuitive and you can stake in just a few clicks. It's a stake pool, which means that BlazeStake automatically spreads your stake across several validators, so you don't need to spend time choosing individual validators or doing extensive research on that, as BlazeStake will take care of all of that for you. When you stake with BlazeStake, your stake is represented in bSOL tokens, so you don't need to worry about the 2-3 days of unstaking delays. Plus, when you stake with BlazeStake, there are some extra rewards that you'll get besides the baseline 5-6% standard APY, you'll be supporting the broader Solana ecosystem through the BlazeStake Treasury, and you'll also be helping with decentralization since your SOL will be staked with multiple validators.
