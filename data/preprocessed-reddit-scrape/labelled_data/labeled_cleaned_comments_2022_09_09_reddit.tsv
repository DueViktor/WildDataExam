No, I'm talking about actual people having actual interest in being threatened or not by the law.

No, no. Not ""completely indistinguishable"" from theft. It is related, but not indistinguishable. Let's not go that far. Notably, because having it completely indsitinguishible would require to claim that a public pending transaction in a mempool can be owned and, thus, stolen. Yet, it's not the case: no one owns any pending transaction. Anyone can read it and be inspired from it to create their own transactions. Sure, it's related to theft, but no one is entitled to having no one else arbitraging their profitable transactions, even more so when they aren't already computed on-chain.

You already know what I'd say to that, right?

Sure, people can disagree. But the thing is we're only two, here, you're having your opinion and I don't disagree, so, clearly, no one disagrees. The fact we could disagree is irrelevant, because the fact is we don't. It also has nothing to do with a cult. A cult of two people who don't even know each others? What is this, even? Weird definition of a cult. XD

When lengthily explaining past censorship, you have to realize others may consider you're solliciting them to provide some clarity to it, whether you actually want it or not.

&gt;There are many people on a forum. People can write things that might not resonate with you, without being in a ""monologue"" or ""echo chamber"". And ""mods"" is also not a single thing, many different people are ""mods"" on platforms, and usually have different opinions too.

No. And neither did you. You know why? Because it's not even an argument to begin with, it's a claim. An unsupported one, on top of it. 

So, no, no one can have heard that argument: because it's not an argument. 

In practice, PoW is centralized and PoS isn't.

That's because PoW has economies of scale PoS doesn't have. And because PoW big miners are easy to spot and coerce, while big stakers can decide to be hard to spot and coerce.

On top of that, PoS ensures the L1 consensus is controlled by the L0 consensus, while PoW gives away its network power to the L1 consensus, aka miners. That's a very bad situation where to be.

Cool. 

&gt;It is ingrained in the functioning of popular government that the people should decide the fate of the social contract they willingly entered. 

As long as it's done in a way that always preserves consent and freedom of association, sure. 

&gt;As such, it would be careless not to mention that there will be violent protesters to the very notion of Union.

As long as you're not disregarding their consent, there's no reason to have violent protesters. 

&gt;Be wary of factions that try to persuade us one way or another by utilizing loud actions and bitter criticism to coax us into the justness of their agendas. 

You mean, like what you're doing? It's good to be honest, at least. 

&gt;Our passion for a decentralized central authority that will sustain a fair, just, and thereby free Interchain for all will be denounced by chains or individuals that, out of fear or misguidance or ignorance, by their mere conviction, endorse a system of Disunion that is hostile to the principles of liberty.

A decentralized central authority? Would you possibly explain that? If it's central authority, it can't be decentralized: a central authority by design renegates any concept of consent or freedom of association. 

Besides, how can a system of disunion be hostile to liberty in the first place, exactly? 

&gt;Undoubtedly there will be objections to the very thought of a centralized decentralized entity. 

Color me surprised. /s 

Maybe because you'd have yet to explain how a centralized entity can be decentralized. Or are you going to try and redefine the concept of decentralization coming from game theory in order to reframe it and support an attempt to actually create a centralized one? 

&gt;Are these objects not the same protests that were made at the formalizing of the American Constitution?

You mean, the same Constitution that failed to prevent the US from becoming what it nowadays is? You'd want to reproduce that? Why? You already have the US. If you're so much a fan of it, you can already get there. 

&gt;The current situation is as dire as the one presented to America when their time came to answer Union or Disunion, when their time came to ratify the constitution, and when their time came to decide between liberty or tyranny.

Yep. And they chose to create the Constitution that didn't prevent tyranny. So, yeah, no, thanks. 

&gt;If Union is not chosen, we, like the states before the constitution, will be left in a miserable shape of disrepair. If we are unwilling to trust the authorities which will raise the interchain high we’ll deteriorate into the depths. We must have the courage and optimism to build a new system.

You mean, the Constitution that produced a government that ensured the US becomes what it is today, or either didn't prevented it to become what it is today, and that's something you want to reproduce on chain? No, thanks, again.

What you need is freedom of association. A union can only be good if it allows anyone to exist outside of it without unconsentfully coercing or harming outsiders. Otherwise, it's not a union, it's a state, with all its centralized authority ruling over unconsenting people, aka slaves of sort.

&gt;The strength of government is essential to the security of liberty

Not an argument, just a claim. Support your claims.

&gt;freedom is vital to the functioning of popular governments

Sure. And a monopoly of unconsented coercion necessarily goes against that. Try again.

&gt;Popular systems depend on liberty to function, thereby, government and liberty are aligned.

Unsupported claim again, that you use to conclude governments and liberty are aligned, despite all examples existing that contradict your conclusion.

&gt;The primary fallacious argument deployed against United Interchain construction is that it poses threat to individual chain sovereignty and, by which, tyranny over the population.

You failed to show how it is a fallacy. That is an unsupported claim again.

&gt;The United Interchain government’s objectives will be

Objectives? You mean, like official goals that states have and that are disregarded on a regular basis? No one cares for objectives. Objectives are wishful thinking fallacies, as is demonstrated by so many agencies blatantly going against their objectives.

&gt;We ask why, if it were the majority of the Interchains resolution to form a Union, would we implement a system that would allow tyranny?

How a majority would be tyranny? Well, let's be clear: it's two wolves and a sheep voting for what's on dinner tonight. No thanks, I don't want to be eaten like everyone else before.

&gt;If we choose the latter, anarchy will ensue.

Anarchy, aka the lack of rulers over unconsenting people. It's literally what you're claiming to support and yet what you're also saying should be avoided. That is not only disingenuous, but also lacking rhetoric skills to avoid making fallacies over fallacies. Impressive lack of quality. The worst is that a few people will believe you just because you use nice enough words. Despicable.

&gt;All we hold dear to our hearts and all we dream for the Interchain will be just that: a dream. We would wonder eternally how high the Interchain could have soared if its wings were not clipped.

Clipped by the lack of a sovereign preventing self-sovereignty? Well, let's ""clip"" these wings, then, so that we stop being imprisoned.

&gt;We’re not going to promise the United Interchain will be different, and we’re certain that many have made that promise before.

Lol, ok, so you're literally saying we'd most probably have a US 2.0. And that you're ok with it. Nice. At least some honesty. XD

190	[]	False		domotheus			[]				text	t2_i5ghusfv	False	True	"The word ""staking"" has been used pretty liberally so I get the confusion. In the context of Proof of Stake it means having a literal *stake* in the network and getting rewards in exchange for performing functions the blockchain needs.

Exchanges and such use that word to basically mean ""give us your coins, we'll pay you x% APR on it"" and then once they have your coins they have liquidity and make money by lending those coins to people who want to borrow them for whatever reason (mainly shorting). This is closer to what a bank does.

The risk with exchange-type staking is you have to trust them to be able to provide that APR in the future and letting you withdraw. If they fuck up and don't have enough funds to cover everyone withdrawing, then the music suddenly stops. When you stake with PoS you're guaranteed the reward (since it's literally the blockchain printing ETH for you if everything else fails), and you don't need to trust anyone (unless you go with a centralized staking pool)

There's risk in everything, so as a typical rule of thumb the higher the APR the higher the risks, and the market is not always efficient at pricing in risks properly so you always have to be careful and do a lot of research before ""staking"" any significant amount of coins"	341623f4792db2783f453ab5df885d2daca4eb30	True	False					0	1662669881		0	{}	inmzj7l	False	t3_x68j7z	False	True	t1_inmjd2v	/r/ethereum/comments/x68j7z/frequently_asked_questions_weekly_discussion/inmzj7l/	1662669893	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		the word staking has been used pretty liberally so i get the confusion in the context of proof of stake it means having a literal stake in the network and getting rewards in exchange for performing functions the blockchain needs exchanges and such use that word to basically mean give us your coins we ll pay you x apr on it and then once they have your coins they have liquidity and make money by lending those coins to people who want to borrow them for whatever reason mainly shorting this is closer to what a bank does the risk with exchange type staking is you have to trust them to be able to provide that apr in the future and letting you withdraw if they fuck up and don t have enough funds to cover everyone withdrawing then the music suddenly stops when you stake with pos you re guaranteed the reward since it s literally the blockchain printing eth for you if everything else fails and you don t need to trust anyone unless you go with a centralized staking pool there s risk in everything so as a typical rule of thumb the higher the apr the higher the risks and the market is not always efficient at pricing in risks properly so you always have to be careful and do a lot of research before staking any significant amount of coins	0.002526712603867054	0.9888340830802917	0.35618528723716736	0.05363266542553902	0.00792327243834734	0.2071576714515686	0.0976005420088768	8.550223355996422e-07	0.3536318242549896	0.011476545594632626

280	[]	False		Awhodothey			[]				text	t2_179hyt	False	False	"Nice lies. BCH is a fork. There's no such thing as a fork from an idea. The original chain is btc. They literally had to fork the chain to create BCH. The rest of what you said is lies too.

Cardano has no scalability on L1. You need L2s for that or you have to shard, and most dapps can't be used across shards. Sharding (and sharded hydra heads) was Cardano's main game plan, and it is years away from implementing that limited scaling solution. As Charles and DC spark have both admitted now, cardano will have to scale with rollups like everyone else, and cardano has just started really working on that. They are many years behind, and they will have the added difficulty of developing in haskell.

Also the staking is significantly less secure than chains that have lockups and slashing and use a 66% resistant BFT. Cardano's staking is more convenient, but there's no argument that not having those three things is less secure. 

Again, your claim that cardano has ""by far the most decentralized block production,"" is objectively false. Anyone can open a block explorer and look at Cardano's pool groups to see that about 20 groups that produce enough blocks to create consensus (or less because Cardano's pool saturation limits let pool owners hide multiple pools for free). And anyone can open a block explorer and see that that is less than the number of entities that create consensus on AVAX and other chains. 

I lol'd at your ""fast and smooth delivery of new functionality"" claim. That is very funny. You must be brand new to cardano.

They did. They forked from the intention to increase block size, which was part of the original design by Satoshi. The block size wars were fabricated to cause a split in the community, narrative was taken control of and people mislead into going with the fork, usurping the $BTC ticker while the original chain had to continue as BCH. I was an active community member at the time this all happened and it was clear that it was a textbook infiltration, using propaganda and defamation tactics vs Roger Ver to silence him.

Also I don't watch any crypto Youtubers, they're all grifters dumping on their followers. I do extensive research myself, compare what's promised vs what's delivered, use the product, run the nodes, keep track of github and how releases, issues etc are dealt with, the kind of people/organizations/projects associating with and building on it, and always keep tabs and revisit these points regularly to see if it's still sound.

Taking into account the above, Cardano's at least half a decade ahead of the entire space. Incredible scalability on L1, unparallelled staking mechanics which make the chain a multitude more secure than any of its peers, by far the most decentralized block production, fast and smooth delivery of new functionality, and after all this time still true to the crypto ethos.

335	[]	False		0xfp			[]				text	t2_hks2jq53	False	False	"Good article. I think there are two main issues with ""real yield"" and ""cash flow tokens"".

The first is that real yields in crypto are flattening and looking less and less attractive in this inflationary environment. The ""risk-free"" rate on lending USDC on Solana (on e.g. Solend, Apricot, Jet) sits somewhere around 4-5%, which isn't great considering the CPI is 8.5%. Buying a inflation-protected instrument like a TIPS would give something like 10%, and I don't know about you, but I trust the Treasury more than I trust Solend.

The second is that--as you point out--that real yields look pretty bad even under this discounted environment. We're a long way from the eye-popping valuations (and 5-6 digit APYs) of the last bull cycle, but even so, a lot of tokens are overvalued relative to their discounted cash flows. I'm not convinced by your argument that CRV yield is ""real"" -- it works only insofar as the locking/bribing flywheel continues to spin."	b9364bb7e989c9ca6a4a640760cfd50cba7c22c1	True	False					0	1662629956		0	{}	inkgotm	False	t3_x8tnr6	False	True	t3_x8tnr6	/r/solana/comments/x8tnr6/new_defi_narrative_real_yield_and_cash_flow/inkgotm/	1662629966	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]		good article i think there are two main issues with real yield and cash flow tokens the first is that real yields in crypto are flattening and looking less and less attractive in this inflationary environment the risk free rate on lending usdc on solana on e g solend apricot jet sits somewhere around 4 5 which isn t great considering the cpi is 8 5 buying a inflation protected instrument like a tips would give something like 10 and i don t know about you but i trust the treasury more than i trust solend the second is that as you point out that real yields look pretty bad even under this discounted environment we re a long way from the eye popping valuations and 5 6 digit apys of the last bull cycle but even so a lot of tokens are overvalued relative to their discounted cash flows i m not convinced by your argument that crv yield is real it works only insofar as the locking bribing flywheel continues to spin 	0.0021777122747153044	0.9889923930168152	0.7166871428489685	0.01904428005218506	0.9943670630455017	0.2536637485027313	0.09818144887685776	8.537210760550806e-07	0.45140689611434937	0.0012504362966865301
