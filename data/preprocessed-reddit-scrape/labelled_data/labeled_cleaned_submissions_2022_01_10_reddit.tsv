So here is the idea:

1. A hub created around a coin for every coin (or at least the ones listed on at least an exchange). Each hub has at least a moderator and zero or more founders (of the coin). A hub consists of the main chat (like Discord) broken into different channels (like software, investing, noob, etc). Founders and moderators can keep a ticker of announcements or broadcast messages. Normal users can join the hubs to have discussions on the main chat channels or create a post like one does on Reddit/FB. The above same applies to NFTs as well.

PS: You can have hubs for other blockchains/crypto/NFT related topics as well, not restricted to coins.

2) One can also track their portfolio by linking to their exchange. They can issue commands in the main chat or generic search box to check current price, view portfolio, get some stats and graphs, view predictions for a coin, etc (resulting in a private message in the main chat), or just go to their portfolio dashboard for that.

All the social network goodies like reacting to posts and messaging, sharing, direct messaging, group messaging, etc are also available. Another goodie could be the ability to trade directly from the chat... something like:

!buy 0.02BTC@40000USD on KuCoin

!sell 0.02BTC@41000USD on Binance

You should be using 

https://btc.com/tools/mining-calculator

To check the real profitability on miners. Now with btc price down, it’s better to buy btc directly than to mine.

Here is a good example.

BITCHMAIN anyminers s19 104 th is $12,000 (plus taxes shipping and whatever else) let’s call it’s $12,000 because I already know 12,000 will produce a total loss for this example anyway, 15,000 would be worse.


$12000 right now is 0.29 btc

To mine 0.29 btc using 104 TH and FREE ELECTRICITY (whose got free electricity??? Do you? Not me)

0.29 btc time frame:
With 3% difficulty increase : cannot show the date it’s after 2030 (9 years)


With 2% difficulty increase :
20th of March 2025


We average between 2-3% difficulty increases for the last 3 years (not factoring in the China dip) 2-3% is a true average.

So before you buy a miner, 

Don’t.


Btc needs to be 70k for the $12,000 miner to be worth it. ($12,000 of 70k btc is 0.17btc which is at least realistic feb 2023 ROI)

I have been all morning thinking about a rather disturbing realization. As much as the central banks have the ability to literally print money by selling bonds or issuing stimulus checks, commercial banks are really the ones actually responsible for drastically increasing the monetary supply through lending. Obviously the control of central banks over interest rates may incentive higher levels of lending by lowering interest rates, but the critical factor here to me seems to be the reserve ratio banks must hold on to: in any case where this ratio is below 1 (hint: always), banks have the actual power to create money themselves. Example: if I lend you $20, you may spend them. Or I may keep them and spend them myself. But it is impossible for the both of us to spend those $20, it's either you or me. On the contrary, if I make a $20 deposit in a bank, they bank may lend them to you (or a fraction of them if the reserve ratio is not exactly 0), but I may still spend those same $20 !

What sparks my interest is that this is a practice that has been sustained for a long, long time whereas stimulus checks and bond transactions seem more limited in amount and duration. So in comparison, the creation of money by banks seems to be a way larger inflationary threat than the policy of central banks itself.

As I understand, Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general, aim to get rid of the legacy monetary and financial systems by offering a monetary system where the available supply is fixed and immutable. Everything seems legit up to this point. However, exchanges like Coinbase or Binance offer lending products in cryptocurrency, so they are actually acquiring the lending functions of traditional banks.

And the key question here would be: is there anything preventing the crypto exchanges from using a reserve ratio different than 1 (obviously not regulation lol)? In other words, can they lend bitcoin that does not exist?

I suspect their ability to lend funds they don't actually posses may be limited by some feature of the blockchain technology and the ""not your keys, not your crypto"" thing, but at this point I just fail to see the connection.

TL;DR: can crypto exchanges print money the same way traditional banks do by lending cryptocurrencies? is my logic somehow flawed?"

Hear me out…each country has their own currency, which could be replaced by Bitcoin. Currently when you buy stocks, you utilized your countries currency to purchase “x” amount of stocks. In the future, would public companies have their own cryptocurrency which you can purchase which would act as your share.

Example: Tesla creates their own cryptocurrency to invest in their company. In order to acquire a share, you would need to purchase one Tesla Coin for 0.002 Bitcoin. You hodl for fives years then decide to sell your one Tesla Coin for 0.02 Bitcoin to then do with what you please.

I am learning about Bitcoin. Currently, I’m learning about distributed consensus on chapter 10 of mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos.  


As far as I read, you can summarize this with 3 parts for Nakamoto consensus. The first is for full nodes to validate transactions. They make sure conditions including AcceptToMemoryPool, CheckTransaction, and CheckInputs in Bitcoin Core. Once transactions are ok, each node put them into a transaction pool.  


Then, miners make a candidate block and do mining. (I think every node is independent, so transaction pool is slightly different among nodes so each miner mines a block consisting of different transactions, but mostly likely with the same previous block hash on the longest chain. I hope I'm getting it right.)  


Once a block is mined by some miner, the miner propagates to its neighbor nodes, and each node checks. If a block is correctly mined satisfying conditions like CheckBlock and CheckBlockHeader in Bitcoin core, they put it on the ledger, and propagate and other nodes also check it if they haven't yet.  


To fully understand, I should probably need to run a node and see, but I’m thinking about the risk of a majority of full nodes not doing jobs right. The first and the last step where full nodes validate, they could simply validate an invalid block to be valid and propagate to its neighbors. And, I totally understand an argument like other nodes will not validate and won’t talk to that bad node. However, we never know that if some malicious groups trying to break Bitcoin’s consensus system especially because it doesn’t cost a lot to be a full node.  To get 51% of hash rate is very expensive, but say you make so many bad full nodes and trying to mess up the ledger sounds reasonable.. Like run 100000 nodes and validate poorly. (Quick search shows 15000nodes currently)  


Now, if so many nodes are bad, then miners will stop talking to them and only good nodes will hear new blocks, but my point is that the health of the network is not obvious. Therefore, some attacks could be possible here, what's making it not to be attacked? (Miners also can lie, but if their blocks get rejected, they lose money. Nodes try to be honest if they make transactions themselves to make sure their transactions went ok, so some incentives for nodes to act well.)

I’ve had some savings sitting there for years and now that I have a better grasp of things I think it’s time to increase my position in BTC (in it for the long term btw, not looking to get rich quick but rather hedge against the inflation of the dollar) and was wondering what exchange would be best for a buy upwards of $15K, fees and transfer wise.

Currently what I hold in BTC I have sitting on Exodus but will be using a cold wallet after I make my next purchase. I understand this might be asking for advice, just looking to hear pros and cons based on personal opinions/choices you’ve made with some of these exchanges (Gemini, kraken, coinbase, kucoin, binance, etc.) Thanks in advance."	what s the best exchange when stacking large amounts of sats bought btc for the first time back in jan 2021 on coinbase wasn t a whole lot then since i was just learning at the time i ve had some savings sitting there for years and now that i have a better grasp of things i think it s time to increase my position in btc in it for the long term btw not looking to get rich quick but rather hedge against the inflation of the dollar and was wondering what exchange would be best for a buy upwards of 15k fees and transfer wise currently what i hold in btc i have sitting on exodus but will be using a cold wallet after i make my next purchase i understand this might be asking for advice just looking to hear pros and cons based on personal opinions choices you ve made with some of these exchanges gemini kraken coinbase kucoin binance etc thanks in advance 	0.0027955980040133	0.9878630638122559	0.030779700726270676	0.06905144453048706	0.9947057366371155	0.9964073300361633	0.33580726385116577	8.42965789615846e-07	0.3678405284881592	0.017646612599492073

Lucky for you, there's a solution! Superluminal travel is the next frontier in bitcoin hodling, but with none of the pesky time commitment!

For those who are unfamiliar, superluminal travel is the conjectural propagation of matter faster than the speed of light. Using superluminal travel we can take advantage of time dilation to appreciate our Bitcoin investments faster!

Moving at faster than light speeds warps the observers perception of time. While the Bitcoin network keeps chugging away, the observer essentially leaps  forward in time! And due to Bitcoin's deflationary nature, massive returns are guaranteed!\*

For the low cost of 5 bitcoin, we will add you to the waiting list for our Superluminal Exponential Growth Study (SEGS™). We can't wait to never see you in the near future!

Lucky for you, there's a solution! Superluminal travel is the next frontier in bitcoin hodling, but with none of the pesky time commitment!

For those who are unfamiliar, superluminal travel is the conjectural propagation of matter faster than the speed of light. Using superluminal travel we can take advantage of time dilation to appreciate our Bitcoin investments faster!

Moving at faster than light speeds warps the observers perception of time. While the Bitcoin network keeps chugging away, the observer essentially leaps forward in time! And due to Bitcoin's deflationary nature, massive returns are guaranteed!\*

Are you tired of mining fiat and dollar cost averaging? Are you running out of patience and want your bitcoin to skyrocket today?

Lucky for you, there's a solution! Superluminal travel is the next frontier in bitcoin hodling, but with none of the pesky time commitment!

For those who are unfamiliar, superluminal travel is the conjectural propagation of matter faster than the speed of light. Using superluminal travel we can take advantage of time dilation to appreciate our Bitcoin investments faster!

Moving at faster than light speeds warps the observers perception of time. While the Bitcoin network keeps chugging away, the observer essentially leaps forward in time! And due to Bitcoin's deflationary nature, massive returns are guaranteed!\*

Many of us want to wallow in our sorrows for losing +40% of our investment value, but as Bitcoin believers, we need to look past the volatility and understand that Bitcoin’s value is about strong foundations, not short-term price action.

Sadly, most of the world doesn’t believe in crypto and they don’t understand its value. They hear the terms “Bitcoin” and “Crypto” and immediately run for the hills, equating it with “Scams”, “Hacks”, and “Meme Coins.” And, frankly, who can blame them with the media jamming “Squid Game coin”, “Mongoose Coin”, and others down our throats. The insane amount of crypto hype has led to the creation of over 16,000 tokens, 99% of which are shitcoins, and a handful are developed solely for rug pulls. It’s too much and it gives crypto a bad rep.

In the bear market of 2018, over 85% of the total crypto market cap was wiped away, sending all those shitcoins into oblivion. Sure, Bitcoin hurt, but it’s the coins with strong foundations that survive. The bear market allows us to remember what’s important, remove all that noise, reduce the scams, and refocus media attention on Bitcoin and other strong coins with great foundations.

Bridgewater founder Dalio said in an interview with the media that it is reasonable to allocate 1% to 2% of the funds in the portfolio to bitcoin. Previously, he admitted to owning a little bit of Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

Dalio acknowledged that bitcoin has its pros and cons, but worries that governments could outlaw cryptocurrencies.

&amp;#x200B;

He also talked about Bitcoin being seen by its proponents as ""digital gold"" and a hedge against inflation, and he himself believes that Bitcoin can be compared to gold because by design, Bitcoin's supply is limited.

I've summarized it from this podcast readthrough from [Ethereum Audible](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2c9XDQZBx88nRMud5BoNzK?si=d4uHuv6PT3O6mM-ffRF7oQ), would love to hear thoughts on how up to date this still is.

### The basics of the beacon chain

Ethereum 2.0 is made up of two core aspects:

1. Proof of stake consensus
2. Sharding

While this primer is slightly outdated and missing the rollup centric roadmap for Ethereum it gives a great overview of the other two key aspects.

### Beacon chain PoS

The Ethereum PoS is broken down into block slots and Epochs. Each block slot is several seconds long in which a validator is given the role of being a block proposer. Every 32 block slots compose one epoch. Finality of blocks occurs at the end of epochs.

The structure is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

* Each slot is 12 seconds
* An epoch is \~6.4 minutes
* Each block is verified and each slot epoch must receive 2/3 majority to be accepted as a legitimate checkpoint
* Once a checkpoint has been accepted it is ‘*justified*’ once the following checkpoint that links to it has been justified, the previously justified checkpoint becomes *finalized*.
* Finalization takes an average of 2.5 epochs = 14 minutes.

### Sharding

One of the Beacon chains main roles is to coordinate shards. Sharding is a technique in database management. To grow a database you can either scale horizontally or vertically.

* Horizontal scaling means adding more power to each node.
* Vertical scaling means adding more nodes.

Sharding is a method of vertical scaling. While the current plans for Ethereum include 64 shards, it is clear as of the beginning of 2022 that at first there will be much fewer shards and they will not be complete Ethereum replicas, rather data storage ones."

A hub created around a coin for every coin (or at least the ones listed on at least an exchange). Each hub has at least a moderator and zero or more founders (of the coin). A hub consists of the main chat (like Discord) broken into different channels (like software, investing, noob, etc). Founders and moderators can keep a ticker of announcements or broadcast messages. Normal users can join the hubs to have discussions on the main chat channels or create a post like one does on Reddit/FB. The above same applies to NFTs as well.\n\nPS: You can have hubs for other blockchains/crypto/NFT related topics as well, not restricted to coins.\n\n2) One can also track their portfolio by linking to their exchange. They can issue commands in the main chat or generic search box to check current price, view portfolio, get some stats and graphs, view predictions for a coin, etc (resulting in a private message in the main chat), or just go to their portfolio dashboard for that.\n\nAll the social network goodies like reacting to posts and messaging, sharing, direct messaging, group messaging, etc are also available. Another goodie could be the ability to trade directly from the chat... something like:\n\n!buy 0.02BTC@40000USD on KuCoin\n\nor\n\n!sell 0.02BTC@41000USD on Binance\n\nWhat do you think? Would you use it and does it bring some value to you?', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am in the middle of development for this and wanted to know your views if something the crypto/NFT community would be interested in?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here is the idea:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A hub created around a coin for every coin (or at least the ones listed on at least an exchange). Each hub has at least a moderator and zero or more founders (of the coin). A hub consists of the main chat (like Discord) broken into different channels (like software, investing, noob, etc). Founders and moderators can keep a ticker of announcements or broadcast messages. Normal users can join the hubs to have discussions on the main chat channels or create a post like one does on Reddit/FB. The above same applies to NFTs as well.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: You can have hubs for other blockchains/crypto/NFT related topics as well, not restricted to coins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) One can also track their portfolio by linking to their exchange. They can issue commands in the main chat or generic search box to check current price, view portfolio, get some stats and graphs, view predictions for a coin, etc (resulting in a private message in the main chat), or just go to their portfolio dashboard for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the social network goodies like reacting to posts and messaging, sharing, direct messaging, group messaging, etc are also available. Another goodie could be the ability to trade directly from the chat... something like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;!buy 0.02BTC@40000USD on KuCoin&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;!sell 0.02BTC@41000USD on Binance&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think?

https://c.coinbasepool.me/#/ &lt;- This is the adress - obviously do not sign up for their bullshit.

Promises incredible returns (and actually for the first 30 days or so it actually returns insane amounts of USDT, that supposedly were exchanged for ""mined"" ETH).

Only to suddenly and randomly move all your funds to a different adress without further warning.

Thankfully, most of what was in the wallet was ""mined"" on that fund, so it did not take all of my live savings 🤣 but i should have just moved the funds elsewhere to fuck them over, after making more than 150% gains in less than a month.

Shortly after I get contacted by the person that initially sparked my interest in the so called mining pool. The person offered me the solution: Just put in exactly the amount that was funneled out and you will get your funds back + 8888 USDT interest :D Of course I obliged (not) and reported the whole thing to Coinbase, Tether, and the authorities (not that I exepct anything to happen, but meh).

If anyone is interested, the smart contract is actually here https://etherscan.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code

Yes my english is not the best, but its enough to understand me. I also speak russian and german. If you dont like my english i can write this in perfect german for you!  


I can tell you why solana can’t dominate. You can hate me for it. But it doesn’t matter as long you use ur brain an evaluate the facts. I will link my thesis. Just to show you its not FUD, its collected facts.

&amp;#x200B;

Solana got two downtimes withn one year (dec 2020 and sept 2021) some people will say it was no downtime just congestion or something else. But in fact the chain was not usable for some hours.

&amp;#x200B;

Solana team say the blockchain is in beta. But guys. A beta would never risk many millions of dollars. This means solana team is playing with your money! (For sure not mine)

This beta thing make one of the last bugs even more terrible. A bug in the solana code risked over 2,5B of dollars. Luckily nothing happened. But IF: than i would be the end for SOL.

We continue with many network issues. Because of congestions, or ddos, or even failed coding.  What i read about the downtime in sept 2021, the bots of a dapp went crazy and spammed the network with transactions. This onliy was possible because a „simple“ priority system for the transaction was not integrated.

Ok we say Solana is growing fast. But its growing fast on a very low quality! It has more bugs and fails than every other blockchain!

&amp;#x200B;

We will go on with validators. Validators have Hardware requirements which costs over 6k of dollars! If more validators join the requirements rise too because the old requirements do not deliver the same amount of rewards!

This is a big issue for decentralization. 

[https://docs.solana.com/de/running-validator/validator-reqs](https://docs.solana.com/de/running-validator/validator-reqs)

And be honest, with this hardware requirements every other blockchain could reach 50k tps easy. Because other POS blockchain just need raspberry pi to be a validator.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets go to the secret wallet.  Theres not much to say, this wallet was hidden, the total supply was higher than expected. After it came out the team tried to do damage limitations and told this coins wer used for market maker :D:D

In the end the community. Solana has a great growing community in the last year. But it was also bad for Solana, many investors here are just shilling fomo guys without any knowledge of their own ivest. I got a discussion some days ago with some sol investors which realy believed the consensus mechanism of solana is proof of history and they also wrote solana does not use proof of stake… and those posts were even upvoted by more than 10 people…

Moreover the member rush through other subreddit and are calling projects like eth, cardano, chainlink, polkadot and so on shit coins…

Thats maybe the reason why even In CC solana is hated so much. 

&amp;#x200B;

Blockchain is all about community. But solana have no community. Or just a real small one…  
I have to say, i had also some pretty good discussion with smart guys here! Iam happy i got those discussions. Also the idea of SOLANA is pretty well. Proof of history was/is promising in the theory. But practically many things are not that well.

In conclusion, a lot of trust is lost, people woke up and see solana isnt this great they thought…  


To many fails, and in the end even the community isnt realy behind this project. Because many guys are here for the fast money. Not more and not less.  


I hope for good discussion, with evidence. I also tried to link SOLANA statemens on twitter. This is not FUD. This are facts:) And yes i dont like solana. Not because iam invested in ADA or ETH, or BSC or CKB. I dont like SOLANA because of its fails and the most. Because of its community members which insulted ALL other Blockchain projects.

Before you check my backround. Iam big ada and eth hodler, was prepared to be a big solana hodler too, but than happened the downtime or how you call it restart of the blockchain in September 2021.  
Yes my english is not the best, but its enough to understand me. I also speak russian and german. If you dont like my english i can write this in perfect german for you!  


I can tell you why solana can’t dominate. You can hate me for it. But it doesn’t matter as long you use ur brain an evaluate the facts. I will link my thesis. Just to show you its not FUD, its collected facts.

Solana got two downtimes withn one year (dec 2020 and sept 2021) some people will say it was no downtime just congestion or something else. But in fact the chain was not usable for some hours.  


Dec 2020

We've just launched our new tool, Stakewiz, which let's you see some key stats but also set up alerts for when validators become delinquent or change their commission.

If you're staking with a validator and they go offline for an extended time this has an adverse impact on your rewards, sometimes they shut down entirely and you're left with no rewards from that point forward. 

Equally in the past we've seen validators change their commission without announcement or maybe you didn't see the announcement. With Stakewiz you can get an alert when any of the above happens and stay on top of your stake, especially when you're using multiple validators.

Please try it out if you think this would be useful for you and let us know if you have any feedback. We'll be adding an option to auto-select validators by pasting your wallet address, APY display and ranking as well as more filtering and statistics options. Later on we will also introduce some tools to help you manage your stake.
