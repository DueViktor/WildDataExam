1. Bitcoin has a finite supply and predictable issuance, which make it attractive as money because it is immune to debasement.
2. Bitcoin also has various other properties that make it attractive as money: it is easily transmissible, non-custodial, secure, etc.
3. Fiat currencies lack these properties and are consequently inferior forms of money
4. Therefore, in time, the world will adopt Bitcoin as a mainstream form of money.

I broadly agree with points 1, 2 and 3. The part where I think the Bitcoin maxi story falls apart is 4.

If we make the (dubious) assumption that all of the world's government are going to come around to the idea that money should have all of the properties of Bitcoin, why would they use Bitcoin instead of making an entirely new currency with those properties? 

There are compelling reasons for world governments *not* to adopt Bitcoin as their 'better' currency. For the moment, the one I am really concerned with is Bitcoin's distribution. Accordingly to Glassnode:

&gt;**We can derive that around 2% of network entities control 71.5% of all Bitcoin.** Note that this figure is substantially different from the often propagated ""2% control 95% of the supply"".

Source: [https://insights.glassnode.com/bitcoin-supply-distribution/](https://insights.glassnode.com/bitcoin-supply-distribution/)

You can imagine that if the entire world decided to transition to using Bitcoin today, these 2% of network entities would be enriched beyond anyone in human history. They would be, in all likelihood, richer than the vast majority of the world's nations combined. I cannot fathom how anyone thinks it is realistic that governments would agree to this.

The fantasy generally seems to be: we are early, and latecomers (including nation states) will buy our bags and make us rich. I'm suggesting people should reflect more critically on that idea. Do you want to live in a world where 2% of network participants control 70% of the world's money, and there is no way for governments to effectively tax that wealth because of Bitcoin's security properties? That sounds an awful lot like the world we already live in, only worse.

Even if you bought at $200 per Bitcoin (way early), and sold it today that's only 100x. So your $1 investment is $100. Not millionaire stuff... You needed to invest $10k back 2017 for that to happen. (Those that got lambos mined it early, or invested thousands in it)

So what will happen???

Nobody can predict the future, but I think it's likely to go to 10X in the next 10 years  and I think it may go to 50X in the next 30 years if we are very lucky. That's still great. You would need a savings account with 13% compound interest to achieve that, it's brilliant. 

There is also a chance for a 70% drop, but I personally think it's unlikely and that 50% from today is the worst you could see. 

So invest in it, hodl it, spend it, use it, and get all the incredible benefits of using it (see many longer posts about decentralised banking).....

Just some late night thoughts before bed."	bitcoin and the debt life i was just thinking what happens to our entire system which relies on constant debt if everyone actually ditches fiat currencies for bitcoin i look around and everyone uses credit cards and loans to buy just about everything their whole lives i haven t read the original white papers and maybe this was part of the plan but how would that work exactly would bitcoin whales become the new banks and lend out bitcoin if everyone quit borrowing so much the system we have would completely break down 100 but i know it could work in fact if you ask anyone 80 or up probably they ll tell you nobody borrowed money for even large purchases like vehicles or homes in their day us people had savings and society progressed is this a hidden reason why there s so much opposition to bitcoin all i ever hear about is privacy concerns and ultimately the ability to stop crime but a paradigm shift like that from debt to non debt seems like it would be an even bigger disruption to those who currently benefit the most from the debt system we have anyway thanks for reading just some late night thoughts before bed 	0.0025554297026246786	0.987458348274231	0.2586873769760132	0.011709889397025108	0.009130735881626606	0.843686580657959	0.09011689573526382	8.601371064287378e-07	0.14870430529117584	0.025352846831083298

She added that she had invested $100,000 in bitcoin, which is now worth over $7 million.

Although Wood did not reveal the year she purchased the cryptocurrency, the amount it was trading at when she bought it suggests that it was sometime in 2015.

She also went on to add that she has not sold any of that initial investment.

Laffer was Wood's teacher at the University of Southern California, who had asked her to take an interest in Bitcoin.

Laffer advised her that Bitcoin was a rules-based monetary system and he was looking for it ""ever since we went off the gold standard.""

When asked by Wood, how big Bitcoin could be, Laffer replied, saying: ""how big is the US monetary base?"" Around that year, the Bitcoin market cap was around $6 billion, and the US monetary base was $4.5 trillion.

When calculated on the current price of about $19,250, Wood has made a whooping profit of over $7.6 million on her $1000,000 investment.

However, she has not been able to find the same level of success with her firm - which she co-founded - as they have been unable to use ARK funds besides investing in securities until recently.

ARK Investment Management focuses on innovative and disruptive investments. The company's value rose during the 2020 stock market boom, with its investments in unprofitable technology firms paying off lucratively, which attracted a huge amount of funds to its exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

They had their Bitcoin on one of the well known exchanges and I explained them that Bitcoin on an exchange is the equivalent of fiat currency in a bank account. The usual ""not your keys, not your coins"", you know the drill.

Surprisingly, they knew that very well but they had been postponing the withdrawal because they were afraid that something could go wrong as they are way far from being a tech savvy person and easily scared to do anything that is not sending a message via WhatsApp or checking their emails. I offered to help but we didn't really manage to schedule a day and time to do this for various reasons up until last week.

This colleague came to my desk asking for help with some IT issues related to their company laptop and told me that they are going to leave the company in January to focus on a different career path as a freelancer. They said they wanted to hire me privately to teach them how to withdraw Bitcoin from the exchange, how to use a private wallet and they also want my technical support to tidy their whole digital life as they have been using the company devices for personal use for too long and they are now struggling to keep their personal accounts and their work accounts separate from each other. They were pretty serious about it and they even asked about my hourly rate as this is something that I was going to do outside office hours for obvious reasons.

Last weekend we met at their house for our first session and I made them create a 24-word seed phrase on BlueWallet. They wrote down the words on a piece of paper and I made them delete the wallet just to be sure they were able to recover it just in case. They typed the 24 words in BlueWallet and there was no issue so at that point I urged them to take a break, lock the phone and take the piece of paper away from the table. I went outside for a smoke, they went in another room and put the piece of paper in a safe place, and once back I guided them through the process of withdrawing their Bitcoin from the exchange. While waiting for the notification of the received funds, I showed them around the app and explained the various settings, the new receiving addresses that can be generated and so on. A couple minutes later the notification pops up and their Bitcoin is in their private wallet.

At this point we have to part ways because they have other people coming over and they ask me to send them my bank account so they can pay me for my service. While I am on my way home I send them a message to tell them that they can pay me in Bitcoin if they want and they say they are ok with it as long as we do this together in person as a first time.

Today we were both at the office and they came to my desk to pay me. I generated the receiving address on my phone, made them scan the QR code, set the lowest fee, and in few minutes, my dear toxic maximalist plebs (LOL), I got my first payment in Bitcoin.

I am now a private IT consultant for a Bitcoiner that pays me in Bitcoin. What a time to be alive.

I have two questions, which I think at some point u/vbuterin et al might have answered already, so, maybe someone can point me in the right direction, or help me brainstorm on them ...

**Transaction Ordering and fixed price transactions.** 

Let's say, I want to model a layer 2 network with fixed price transactions and do a simple FIFO model for transactions, instead of a gas price auction. It would lead to first-come-first-serve, eliminate the front runners, but most likely introduce other problems. I would be interested if someone already worked out, on the theoretical side, which downsides this would have against the gas price auction model. I tried to sift through reddit, the greater web and ethereum-magicians, but nothing came up.

**TX Payment Post-Ex**

Let's further say, I want to deduct the transaction fee in this hypothetical layer 2 chain post execution. This would enable that smart contracts pay, with certain accuracy, for the transaction itself. For example, the classical ""how can I convert my weth to eth if I don't have any eth"" would be gone. On a node-operator level it would probably introduce DDoS problems and maybe also a lot other problems down the road. Was there maybe already some discussion around this topic somewhere?

Again, I tried to find something on reddit/ethereum-magicians/etc. But my search mostly brought up issues around EIP1559 etc. 

If anyone knows a paper, article, blog post, or any work around these two topics, it would be highly appreciated.

Thanks

A lot of developers we spoke with pointed out that almost every Web3 project requires meaningful blockchain activity to be ingested into a centralized backend programmatically. This can take a while and be rather tedious.

So, we built hal Streams.

Our mission with this product is:

* Provide a free solution to Web3 builder
* Introduce a no-code way to query and filter on-chain data through an API
* Make the most user-friendly solution on the market

**We're looking for our earliest adopters who can give us feedback :)**

**Hal Streams is totally free to start using,** btw. And hopefully, you will find it very useful!

The main goal behind Ethereum is for people to be able to self-govern so it should come as a given that anything built on Ethereum and willing to follow its main core and values, should have an open source code.

That’s it, there are no loopholes. There are no exceptions. There are no if, and, or buts.

An application, network, or rollup that retains the value of Ethereum should retain open source code

Just because a rollup \*\*\*claims\*\*\* to follow EVM equivalence doesn’t automatically mean that it truly does.

Take ZkSync for example. They are constantly being criticized by the community and especially rivaling developers for the fact that they claim to have “the first ever zkEVM” when in reality no one even knows if it even works. The code is completely closed source which is a big non amongst developers.

This is actually the main reason behind Mihailo Bjelic’s tweet (the title of this post).

Mihailo is one of the leading developers at Ethereum scaling solution, Polygon. So it wouldn’t come as a surprise that there’s some rivalry between him and the ZkSync team.

However, when confronted about having a closed source zkEVM versus Polygon’s open source, some ZkSync supporters started coming up with excuses and fork accusations all of which were shut down by what I think is any Ethereum community member could have said. Mihailo stated:

“Open source code and verifiability are some of the core Ethereum values.

Polygon zkEVM (and everything else we build) follows these values.

The community needs to demand this from every scaling project. If you can't see and verify the code, it's not safe and it's not Ethereum.”

Regardless of whether it was Polygon, Scroll, Zksync, Loopring, Arbitrum, Optimism, or any other rollup, this statement should be applied.

As I said, there should never be an excuse as to why your code is closed source on Ethereum. This is a network that is led by the community and is constantly getting improved and protected by said community as well.

If this community cannot access your code, you are technically violating everything Ethereum stands for."

I'm currently on a research run about DeFi hacks for personal matters (i plan to have a DeFi project in the future and i want to learn vulnerability patterns and stuff like that). I'm truly impressed about the funds stolen in some hacks like the Ronin network hack but even 100k usd stolen is a lot compared to what it takes to stole that ammount for (i.e) a bank.

I feel that DeFi hacks are very low risk compared to other heists IRL and that's why they are so popular. It's not like entering a place taking hostages and shooting everyone, you are just being smarter than the protocol's developers thinking in edge-case scenarios that they didn't think of. So for the hacker is a win/win, and even if they get caught, it's not like they killed someone (which usually happens at real life heists) so they know that their sentence is probably a lot less strong than what they might face for a similar profit heist IRL. 

With this motivation for the hackers and this scenario where everyone can post their contracts code and create a DeFi protocol, **will the hacks to DeFi ever cease**?   
There will **ALWAYS** be risk of vulnerable protocols because there will always be plenity of them, thats the magic of Ethereum, the fact of decentralizing the world. 

What do you think? Is it possible to make DeFi a safer place without relying in centralized solutions like a centralized auditing company or something like that?"

Market effects are generally delayed in response to this by a couple of weeks, (read the chart!). Breach has consolidated (we are now moving back down sharply), down trend channel re-entry now more likely. Bottom in?

The green hammer candle was followed by two spinning tops-all are harbingers of short term trend reversal....***which we now have.*** You saw that called right out the windshield in moy slow motion here day after day-the power of TA that. It may drop back under the line, but the cat is outta this bag now.\n\n***BTC and ETH tides have moved from negative to neutral, and ATOM has slid from negative to neutral to positive all from last week.....that is trend turning result.***\n\n""Point of Singularity"" (Support vs OHR trend collision) occurs 11/01/2022 unless trend is broken beforehand, and so far that is just now teasing here.....with an UP call.

Well, you know my consistently annoying thinking on that haha.

But check the chart, no vague TA voodoo there, just K.I.S.S. obvious stuff with an out-the-windshield call on it. And when you sit back and think about it-it all just fits together doesn\'t it? Divine Coincidence? Um, I don\'t think so\\* . . . (and no, I am not a conspiracy theorist).\n\n\\*Intelligent Design.\n\n*Weak + consolidating just above Support as the TIP crashes = Price Down Potential High inside two weeks....unless SKYNET decides to prop it all up (again).*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe have fallen back well under OHR1 hard. Ouch! Nothing magical here, just pure persistent weakness. Sideways consolidation in a descending weak market that has heavy RINA pressures (primarily CPI/FED Mambo here), ***this ""usually"" results in a subsequent leg down***. Indeed, net down is all that can be seen thus far.\n\n***As I have bleated for a while now:***\n\n*The difference here is the way we approached negative trending OHR. Unlike last time, which appears SKYNET Violence Based (an ""SPD"": std pump/dump infection), this one is a gradual grind up. It ""appears"" a bit more considered/thoughtful/organic. That is NOT an endorsement haha-just an observation. The conventional chartists out there (and yes, I call them Skynet\'s unwitting ""CCrs""), will call this a ""bear flag formation"". I am not said conventional chartist. I do DDT, and in DDT, we don\'t do the bear flag thang. It is a crap pattern as this ""bear flag"" is also how markets grind up in recovery.

Unlike last time, which appears SKYNET Violence Based (an &amp;quot;SPD&amp;quot;: std pump/dump infection), this one is a gradual grind up. It &amp;quot;appears&amp;quot; a bit more considered/thoughtful/organic. That is NOT an endorsement haha-just an observation. The conventional chartists out there (and yes, I call them Skynet&amp;#39;s unwitting &amp;quot;CCrs&amp;quot;), will call this a &amp;quot;bear flag formation&amp;quot;. I am not said conventional chartist. I do DDT, and in DDT, we don&amp;#39;t do the bear flag thang. It is a crap pattern as this &amp;quot;bear flag&amp;quot; is also how markets grind up in recovery.

In doing research I found 

1. this actually happens to a lot of people. Mostly newer, but at the rate of people running into this. It isn't something you can walk backwards in.
2. the current no timeout system makes it less user-friendly. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Solution:

A simple solution is a timeout function within ETH that you can opt out from. So basically, if a transaction has been in pending hell for a week or 2 (after x blocks) mark it as dropped.

&amp;#x200B;

What could happen is there could be a way to opt out. Like if the transaction says ""no timeout"" then it opts out. On metamask or whatever this can be done mostly on the backend and this gives the user the ability to use some checkbox or whatever if they wanted to opt out of this. 

If you opt out then it should basically do what it does now. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Beyond this obviously the guides will have to be updated, and people will have to be inform the average transaction after x date will timeout after a week or 2. The person can override the transaction like they do now if they didn't want to wait or they opt out."

# Interview:

&amp;#x200B;

1. ***Let’s get to the interview right away! How expected was the win for you? ;)***

**Dual Finance**

&gt;A definite shocker. We had practically forgotten we made a submission because we've been so busy building the project out further.

**Tensor Trade**

&gt;We actually participated in both Solana Riptide &amp; Solana Summer Camp (Riptide where we won 3rd for an NFT pricing oracle we worked on before pivoting to Tensor Trade).   
&gt;  
&gt;Going into Summer Camp we knew that it was going to be much more competitive (60% more participants!) and knew our chances were slim in general. We were overjoyed when we found out that (1) we won 2nd in a category and (2) it was in DeFi (we're the FTX for NFT trading). We knew we had something with Tensor Trade based on the traction we've observed since our public launch, but winning something at Solana Summer Camp was further validation that we built something people loved.

**DreamOS**

&gt;Actually rather unexpected, as we originally applied for the Web3 track, but ended up winning in the gaming track!

**Monstrè**

&gt;We did not quite expect it! We did the best we could and received tons of help and feedback from the IRL hackathon location in Singapore. 

**Better Call Sol**

&gt;We saw some traction online but we were realistic about our odds, since our track alone had over 400 submissions. It sure was a pleasant surprise though!

**The100**

&gt;We heard people were enjoying the demo and thought it was cool but honestly winning was still a surprise! Sometimes you never know where you'll get signal and what will click with people.

**CandyPay**

&gt;We have been working hard for the last 2 months, building to power mobile native NFT and Payment experiences on Solana which is the current need for ecosystem users. Being power mobile users ourselves, the UX is unbearable and we thought it is a problem worth solving. Fast forward, we have been used at multiple IRL sites across the world with people loving the seamless feel, so we had great expectations to win a prize for sure!   
&gt;  
&gt;Fun Fact: CandyPay might be the only project which not only submitted for this Hackathon but also got used at 5 IRL Summercamp sites where our fellow builders minted those proof of attendance gasless NFTs :)

**Lulo**

&gt;We had high hopes but certainly not any expectation for a win.

**Dao Chat**

&gt;Not expected at all - we were too busy worrying on whether Dao Chat would be found valuable by the community, yet alone the judges. 

**SolStamps**

&gt;From the moment we came up with the SolStamps concept, and by the time we built a working Proof of Concept, our team was fairly confident there was a good chance of being on the potential win radar. All the while, we were shocked and honored to win the University Award Prize. 

**CINI - Next Generation Film Camera**

&gt;It was totally unexpected! While we were confident that CINI will reinvent the photo NFT space but didn’t yet have a clue about its market acceptance. It’s amazing feedback for CINI to be recognized by the Solana Foundation within a pool of talented teams and projects from the Summer Camp Hackathon.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***2. Tell us a little bit about your team (how could we miss this question), something interesting beyond what you’ve already mentioned in your presentation or project description. Maybe some fun facts, or your hidden talents 🤔*** *//* *My personal favourite question ;)*

**Dual Finance**

&gt;The founders met playing lacrosse at MIT.

**Tensor Trade**

&gt;We (Ilja and I) were complete strangers living on opposite sides of the world 6 months ago. We both found each other through YC's co-founder matching portal, struck it off with our first trial project (Tensor NFT oracle), and the rest is history :) 

**DreamOS**

&gt;We're the Dream Team!  
&gt;  
&gt;We have a very young team, I'm the oldest person on our team at 28, my two co-founders are 22 and 18.  
&gt;  
&gt;We aren't like other startups, we don't have deep industry experience in our sector, we just have a really good idea and a dream. We also actually care about our users.  
&gt;  
&gt;We aren't obsessed with extracting value. I just want to build the tools that blockchain users have been LACKING for so long for whatever reason.   
&gt;  
&gt;Web3 has a massive UX problem, and yet we have more devs building coin flip games on Solana than working on UX! It's mind boggling.

**Monstrè**

&gt;CM, the co-founder of Monstrè is an animal lover. We initially started as an animal-centric NFT project, to fundraise for the local Animal Welfare Groups and also raise awareness for animal protection. There were people in the local community who wanted to support us but found on-boarding too much of friction. So we decided to join the hackathon to solve this particular pain point. 

**Better Call Sol**

&gt;Lab Eleven is a team of Australian web3 engineers, split between Melbourne and Sydney. We've known each other through our past careers, where we built some pretty complex solutions for a diverse set of clients. We're now bringing all that experience and focusing it on Solana. We'll be at Breakpoint so come say hi or just stare from a distance, whatever is your speed. ^(Our Jane will be there too, btw ;))

**the100**

&gt;We're a team of creatives who love art and tech! For whatever reason, there seems to be a lot of this type in Solana - if you're one of them, come join us!

**CandyPay**

&gt;We are a team of young builders who love building cool projects instead of studying in school xD  
&gt;  
&gt;Fun fact here will be we all are under 18 yrs and haven't passed the legal age yet, some just finished high school and others have entered recently. So it's a roller coaster ride of handling school, exams, building, bugs, and stuff. Time management and keeping production up and running were the hardest part, as there might have been some server issues cause of excess usage and our backend friend might be in school to handle them, so we all kept learning new things every day to keep the ship running!   
&gt;  
&gt;We have certainly grown out of that stage and have learned a lot more than any school or job could teach us in this short timeframe :)

**Lulo**

&gt;Lulo was inspired at the Miami Hacker House

**Dao Chat**

&gt;The team was made up of two students, Bruno and Nick, however it doesn’t feel right saying it was just us two because we couldn’t have built Dao Chat if it weren’t for many other Solana devs giving us advice, ideas and technical help. A fun fact is that we’ve been playing on the same football team for the past 6 years. 

**SolStamps**

&gt;James is a professional fly fisherman and was on the National United States Youth Fly Fishing Team. Ryan is highly talented at the exquisite art of jumping jacks. 

**CINI - Next Generation Film Camera**

&gt;In the initial dApp demo, Dan recorded CINI’s capture-and-develop flow to show the team internally. While there were no issues with the demo itself, however since it captured the chaotic state of his room, the team in unison refused to use that version! Now it wouldn’t have been a good idea to show the world, would it?  
&gt;  
&gt;In the spirit of web3, our team is fully remote. We had teammates based in Berlin, Vancouver and Taipei during the hackathon. Working with time zones across three continents was definitely a challenge. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***3. What brought you to the Solana Ecosystem?*** 

**Dual Finance**

&gt;Cheap rent &amp; fast transactions with full on-chain CLOB's like Serum &amp; Mango Markets to build atop. Also a sense that Solana token projects were in the greatest need of better token incentive structures.

**Tensor Trade**

&gt;(1) How cheap it was to experiment and send transactions directly to mainnet and (2) the compelling compute model and (3) using Rust. Most of these are technological reasons but this matters a ton when you're trying to build a low-latency, real-time NFT trading platform where real-time actually matters when finality is sub 1-second.

**DreamOS**

&gt;NFTs.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bored Apes had just minted a couple months prior, and everyone was getting into NFT's. The first NFT I ever purchased was a Solarian, and the first NFT I ever minted was a Degenerate Ape Academy.  
&gt;  
&gt;So I spent the better part of a year just minting and flipping NFT's, looking back it feels like a massive waste of time. But super grateful to be here, to meet the people I did in NFT's, and now to be building tools for NFTs.

**Monstrè**

&gt;The awesome community and developer tooling available. Transaction fees are also very low.

**Better Call Sol**

&gt;We wrote a [whole blog](https://blog.labeleven.dev/why-solana) about this! But let's face it, people rather skim a twitter thread so here you go: [https://twitter.com/yaamehn/status/1537187253893550081](https://twitter.com/yaamehn/status/1537187253893550081) 

**The100**

&gt;I'm most excited by the idea of blockchain as ""code legos"" / an entirely new way to build software that harnesses the internet's ""hive mind."" Solana, with its high speed and monolithic blockchain, seems best suited towards this endeavor.

**CandyPay**

&gt;Superteam DAO and the ample opportunities Solana has brought for young builders were the forces that attracted us to the Solana Ecosystem. 

**Lulo**

&gt;Low fees, High throughput, it's fun building in an environment like that.

**Dao Chat**

&gt;The first line of Web3 code I wrote was for the Solana blockchain by chance due to a random tutorial I had watched, but since then, I still haven’t found a single reason or need to leave the ecosystem or join a new one. 

**SolStamps**

&gt;Good question. Upon framing a proposed idea for SolStamps, we quickly realized that our software would require a blockchain to support its ability to drive a massive number of transactions in a timely manner. The reputation of the Solana Ecosystem is scalability and speed, a perfect match for a high-volume service such as email. Furthermore, from a monetization outlook, unlike other chains with enormous gas fees, the .00025 average cost per transaction allows us to offer our service at a reasonable price while maintaining a considerable margin.

**CINI - Next Generation Film Camera**

&gt;The Solana ecosystem is the optimal fit for CINI, due to its impressive track record with the play-to-earn model and NFTs. On top of that, with the launch of Saga, the first dapp native phone, it would create a seamless user experience.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***4. How will your project enrich Solana ecosystem and make it better?***

**Dual Finance** 

&gt;Providing sustainable &amp; aligned incentive structures for other token projects. Goodbye inflationary rewards. Hello Staking Options.

**Tensor Trade**

&gt;We want to make NFTs as liquid as Dogecoin, and we think we can do it by providing a better trading experience to traders who are used to sub-second, real-time DeFi trading.  
&gt;  
&gt;We are working on a number of new primitives &amp; protocols that will hopefully make NFTs 100x more liquid. For example, we launched TensorSwap, the fastest NFT AMM on Solana, just a few weeks after we wrapped up Tensor Trade :)

**DreamOS**

&gt;Well, the problem currently is that Solana is, for the lack of a better phrase, """"homeless"""". Or if you prefer, Solana lives in a cardboard box named Phantom. And that box is small and only has 1 room.  
&gt;  
&gt;What we're doing is we're building a Home for web3 - with endless rooms for all your different web3 activities, such as marketplaces, DeFi, NFT organization -  
&gt;  
&gt;I've been on Solana for over a year now, and we still don't have tools to even VIEW your NFTs, most people still go to Magic Eden to look at their NFT's and portfolio value - this is kind of like going to the grocery store to see what food you have in your fridge.   
&gt;  
&gt;So we're building all the tools that will make using crypto as easy as using your desktop computer or accessing your bank account, from your home.

**Monstrè**

&gt;We will make it easy for people to get from zero to one onto Solana with very little friction. Our hero product, the USDC Gift Cards, will redefine remittance, crypto commerce as well accessibility to DeFi.

**Better Call Sol**

&gt;Better Call Sol was created to better the Solana development experience and provide a more interactive way of educating users on how to use the chain. It was created as a public good and was open-sourced right away. Lowering the barrier to entry for developers is huge step in ecosystem adoption. Next time, you just want to run a quick ad-hoc transaction against the chain, remember to Better Call Sol!

**the100**

&gt;We're aiming to build a product that is engaging but also incredibly simple that reaches users who don't know how to use crypto. And then if those users want to go deeper and say, become a channel owner, \*then\* they'll need to learn how it all works, which is great for the ecosystem.

**CandyPay**

&gt;Mobile native web3 experiences are still very early and unbearable for users. Solana has been working on this direction with Saga Phone and we are here to double down on this movement! Our mission is to serve Solana Ecosystem users in a way they feel familiar with and convenient while using solana in their everyday life.  
&gt;  
&gt;When they Mint NFTs the experience should be smooth and fast without relying on desktops all the time, and that's what we have achieved using QR Codes and Tap to Mint user flows  
&gt;  
&gt;In the coming time, we are launching our first Payment product and it will change how people currently transact with Cryptocurrencies. Built on Solana Pay, we will be powering a '1-Click Tap to Pay' payment experience which will be on par with GPay, and Apple pay, tailored for web3 users and merchants, it will be a seamless, fast, cost-efficient method to pay and merchants can reach a global audience while earning more compared to traditional payment rails. This will set a new standard for payments in web3 and we ought to make Solana the best user-centric chain, with CandyPay powering creators with the best no-code, low-code solutions   
&gt;  
&gt;This way we feel in the coming time, CandyPay will hold a special place in users' hearts and will have a great impact on Solana Ecosystem as a whole!

**Lulo**

&gt;Toly has been pretty vocal about rebuilding DeFi using order books.  We aim to become the lending/borrowing component of that rebuild :) 

**Dao Chat**

&gt;Dao Chat isn’t meant to work alone as we describe it in our video, it is more of a missing puzzle piece and tool which will add to the decentralisation and independence of DAOs. 

**SolStamps**

&gt;Every user of SolStamps interacts with the Solana Blockchain. Even though SolStamps is a blockchain-based company, we are not targeting the Web3 community. We created our software for anyone looking to secure their email: bankers, lawyers, financial advisors, escrow agents, psychologists, and even the average internet user. Designing our product in this way directly connects people who would likely never interact with Web3 to the Solana blockchain. The consequence: we're spreading the reach of the Solana platform and the security offered to an entirely new demographic of users. 

**CINI - Next Generation Film Camera**

&gt;Web3 adoption still faces many challenges, especially with non-crypto users. Solana is one of the fastest-growing ecosystems within web3, however, its current infrastructure and applications are not friendly to the average mom and pop. Take StepN for example, they are one of the first protocols that created such massive waves outside of the web3 space and users. This is what we aim to achieve with CINI - to make it more accessible for everyday users, before being a capture-and-earn product.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***5. What have you got from the hackathon aside from the prize money and possible future fame and success?***

**Dual Finance**

&gt;Acknowledgement that what we're building is worthwhile &amp; momentum on our fund raise.

**Tensor Trade**

&gt;We were able to connect with a number of other projects in this space (including you guys!) ^(thanks! :)) Looking forward to meeting more hackathon winners in the coming days.

**DreamOS**

&gt;We actually haven't received our prize money yet  
&gt;  
&gt;We did get reached out to by several VC's

**Monstrè**

&gt;Connections to the Solana Foundation and access to knowledgeable and talented engineers and founders.

**Better Call Sol**

&gt;Working on an idea from inception to execution in a short period of time is exhilarating. Winning the prize also validates our thinking and motivates us to push our project further. It has been great to be able to show the ecosystem what we are capable of. 

**the100**

&gt;I've met some great people! I've been reading Packy McCormick's awesome newsletter, Not Boring, for quite some time and had the opportunity to pitch to him - really cool.

**CandyPay**

&gt;In the initial days when we used to approach projects for a potential partnership, most of them used to think of us as a scam or fake promise as we didn't have much social credibility and the promise of completely removing 'connect wallet' from user's life and powering a ""Tap to Mint' seamless user experience was a big shift and most didn't actually understood it well. This hackathon win gave us what we needed the most -- Social Credibility and a clear sign that not only Mobile native UX is the need of the hour, but our execution is also going in the right direction to serve the users :)

**Lulo**

&gt;Credibility is probably the most valuable thing.  We've had a lot more inbound interest for partnerships due to the hackathon.

**Dao Chat**

&gt;Above everything, motivation is what we received, backed by confidence, and these are the most valuable assets a developer can have. 

**SolStamps**

&gt;First and foremost, the competition validated the idea of a Web3-centric identity-based cybersecurity software. Since validating the authenticity of an email using digital identities is a relatively new concept, we found it reassuring to be credited by these esteemed judges. Second, the victory is a validation of our idea that should help in our fundraising efforts. 

**CINI - Next Generation Film Camera**

&gt;Coming up with the idea for CINI would not have happened without the hackathon! We thought it would be a fun experience to join one on a global scale. After several brainstorming sessions, we came up with the idea for CINI which we were all excited about. Plus, nothing beats the high and momentum of completing a project from start to finish! There were so many times during the hackathon when we were unsure if we would make it to the finish line. It’s also been great to connect with talented people within the industry to learn more about all things on how to build a product. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***6. How was it - launching a project in a bear market?***

**Dual Finance**

&gt;Great environment to build the right way. We don't need to rush to production or try to over market the products. The people still around today get the value proposition.

**Tensor Trade**

&gt;Launching an MVP/early stage project in a bear market is the best thing you can do.  
&gt;  
&gt;There's 10x less noise and hype that frankly dilutes projects that are actually pursuing something of substance. In a bear market, you know if your product has traction or if it's just riding on momentary hype that will fade away over time.

**DreamOS**

&gt;Stressful - we are launching an NFT called breadheads ahead of the official DreamOS rollout, and when the bear market hit, the activity got so low on twitter and discord, it was pretty discouraging.  
&gt;  
&gt;But it was a good lesson, and it was an exercise in discipline - if you can keep your head down and ignore the noise (or lack of noise), and focus on the problem you're solving, and keep building despite negativity all around you, then you are going to make it. 

**Monstrè**

&gt;To us it does not matter as we are building infrastructure that is useful in a bear or bull market.

**Better Call Sol**

&gt;Bear market is a great time to build. There are a lot less distractions and we can get down to building some great products.

**the100**

&gt;I'm fortunate to be able to bootstrap Garden Labs with my creative agency Blanc so I mostly can ignore the crazy swings of the market.

**CandyPay**

&gt;It was tough to be true, cause there were not many projects launching in bear markets, and most of them pushed their launch date, and those who launched simply disagreed to use our minting meta as it was too new for users and they didn't want to do something creative. I feel our initial reach outs were simply not the right projects who were too conservative, but things have changed for the better recently! 

**Lulo**

&gt;It's been a grind...but that's what the bear market is for...building :) 

**Dao Chat**

&gt;It perhaps took some pressure off our backs, and really filtered out the true community team-players from others only looking for quick returns.

**SolStamps**

&gt;Thankfully, the broader economic bear market and the crypto downturn had a negligible impact on SolStamps. For the competition, we were able to self-fund the project. More notably, our software relies on people using email, which is essentially uncorrelated to economic conditions. 

**CINI - Next Generation Film Camera**

&gt;As we all know, the bear market is the best time to get BUIDL-ing. One of the biggest challenges with developing a web3 product is separating speculators from true fans. A bear market takes away the speculation and promotes reasonable expectations for web3 products. This is the ideal time to focus on building up solid products for users.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***7. What are you most excited about now after winning?***

**Dual Finance**

&gt;Growing the reach of the project &amp; continuing to build out our roadmap towards the DUAL token launch!

**Tensor Trade**

&gt;We're still fully heads-down building and working our next big product: TensorSwap. If you're looking to trade NFTs with super low fees (1% total, 0.9% goes back to creators) and want to liquidity farm your NFTs, come check out TensorSwap!

**DreamOS**

&gt;It's onto the next hackathon for us - we're going to be in Chicago for the xHack Hackathon  
&gt;  
&gt;then we are going to Lisbon for Breakpoint ^(You should definitely meat our Jane there!)   
&gt;  
&gt;but I'm most excited for after all of that - to move to New York and get our new office set up - our team is mostly remote right now but we will be convening in NY after Breakpoint :)

**Monstrè**

&gt;Getting the first users!

**Better Call Sol**

&gt;Even before winning the prize, we were keen to continue this project, expanding its scope and adding more functionalities. That has not changed, if anything now we are even more motivated. The tool is still in Alpha and plenty of potential to be explored.

**the100**

&gt;Hopefully raising some funds to help us move faster! And continuing to meet people excited about the project that want to get involved, whether that's as a creator, a user, or just to lurk on the Discord.

**CandyPay**

&gt;After winning the hackathon, we are much more energetic, motivated, and excited to push our mission of powering best ever Payments experiences in the Solana Ecosystem! We will keep scaling our NFT initiatives and have direct collaborations with launchpads and Marketplaces to serve a whole new UX to mobile native users.   
&gt;  
&gt;Meanwhile, a great focus will be on launching our first-ever payment product which will allow any online business, ecom store, or sass service already accepting credit cards to accept Solana and USDC in a seamless low code way! with this, users can pay in usdc/sol in a 1-click Tap to Pay seamless user experience, which gonna set a new standard of on-chain payments and we will change commerce on web3 forever! :D

**Lulo**

&gt;Getting back to work :), talking with other teams about their roadmaps and where we can align.

**Dao Chat**

&gt;Collaborating with other teams and amplifying our voices to other projects. 

**SolStamps**

&gt;In the next couple of months, we're beyond excited to release SolStamps V1.0 to the public and start scaling the user base. As we intend to make blockchain's decentralized, immutable, and trustless attributes accessible to any Web2 user, we redesigned the software to eliminate the more technical features included in the proof of concept (such as knowing how to set up and fund a Phantom wallet). Now, with V1.0, users can reap the benefits of the Solana blockchain without ever needing to send or receive crypto. By eliminating the need for the Phantom Wallet, only one download is necessary to send emails securely. We are also thrilled to begin a pre-seed round of financing to enable the launch of an app that will be compatible with all email services, browsers, and devices. 

**CINI - Next Generation Film Camera**

&gt;It was overwhelming to receive messages in support of CINI and their anticipation for the beta test! We’re rolling full steam ahead to get the promised MVP ready for beta test ASAP.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***8. Which project/s of other hackathon participants impressed you?***

**Dual Finance**

&gt;Excited to see what comes from our fellow Gaming &amp; Mobile track winners. We see these as major growth areas to onboard more users to Solana, who we wish to support by being the projects' incentive liquidity infrastructure provider.

**Tensor Trade**

&gt;[Ora Labs](https://twitter.com/oralabs_) is working on something that is sorely needed on Solana: would be quite excited to see their first MVP and take it for a spin.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our friends at Lulo Finance are also working on a much more market-efficient order book model for loans: keep an eye out for them!

**DreamOS**

&gt;Ora Labs was an impressive project, the blockchain search engine was a feature that we had dreamed of for DreamOS, very excited to work with their team on integrating their search engine into DreamOS.

**Monstrè**

&gt;Ora Labs for sure! Concept is unique and will make Solana Blockchain Data more accessible and easier to understand.

**Better Call Sol**

&gt;I can't speak for our whole team but personally as a developer, I am most interested in the developer tooling (you probably could have guessed from our hackathon submission). The judges seem to be aligned on this interest as we saw the grand prize go to IronForge. Along the same lines, I think Seahorse, the Python framework for writing Solana programs, will unlock a whole new block of developers and that's exciting to see.

**the100**

&gt;There's this project called Titlepool where they're basically trying to fix the film distribution industry with blockchain - it's a great project. They also own Channel 4 on the100 and are streaming a huge catalog of awesome indie film content :)

**Lulo**

&gt;Sooooo many of them.  We are friends with the IronForge, Ora, Tensor, PoolProps, folks, so it was good to see they got recognition as well. 

**SolStamps**

&gt;While our team is wildly impressed by the innovation of the winning projects and the development they bring to the Solana ecosystem and Web3 in general, the project we are most enthusiastic about is Ora: the first search engine for blockchain data. The ability to fix a preeminent issue as complex as retrieving chain-based data in a user-friendly way is fantastic. The variety of filter and search options in the Ora Transaction Viewer makes for a very palatable and informative search query. 

**CINI - Next Generation Film Camera**

&gt;The grand champion, IronForge! It’s always exciting to see dev tools to create an easier and seamless development experience and lower the barrier to developing on Solana."

# Interview:

&amp;#x200B;

1. ***Let’s get to the interview right away! How expected was the win for you? ;)***

**Dual Finance**

&gt;A definite shocker. We had practically forgotten we made a submission because we've been so busy building the project out further.

**Tensor Trade**

&gt;We actually participated in both Solana Riptide &amp; Solana Summer Camp (Riptide where we won 3rd for an NFT pricing oracle we worked on before pivoting to Tensor Trade).   
&gt;  
&gt;Going into Summer Camp we knew that it was going to be much more competitive (60% more participants!) and knew our chances were slim in general. We were overjoyed when we found out that (1) we won 2nd in a category and (2) it was in DeFi (we're the FTX for NFT trading). We knew we had something with Tensor Trade based on the traction we've observed since our public launch, but winning something at Solana Summer Camp was further validation that we built something people loved.

**DreamOS**

&gt;Actually rather unexpected, as we originally applied for the Web3 track, but ended up winning in the gaming track!

**Monstrè**

&gt;We did not quite expect it! We did the best we could and received tons of help and feedback from the IRL hackathon location in Singapore. 

**Better Call Sol**

&gt;We saw some traction online but we were realistic about our odds, since our track alone had over 400 submissions. It sure was a pleasant surprise though!

**The100**

&gt;We heard people were enjoying the demo and thought it was cool but honestly winning was still a surprise! Sometimes you never know where you'll get signal and what will click with people.

**CandyPay**

&gt;We have been working hard for the last 2 months, building to power mobile native NFT and Payment experiences on Solana which is the current need for ecosystem users. Being power mobile users ourselves, the UX is unbearable and we thought it is a problem worth solving. Fast forward, we have been used at multiple IRL sites across the world with people loving the seamless feel, so we had great expectations to win a prize for sure!   
&gt;  
&gt;Fun Fact: CandyPay might be the only project which not only submitted for this Hackathon but also got used at 5 IRL Summercamp sites where our fellow builders minted those proof of attendance gasless NFTs :)

**Lulo**

&gt;We had high hopes but certainly not any expectation for a win.

**Dao Chat**

&gt;Not expected at all - we were too busy worrying on whether Dao Chat would be found valuable by the community, yet alone the judges. 

**SolStamps**

&gt;From the moment we came up with the SolStamps concept, and by the time we built a working Proof of Concept, our team was fairly confident there was a good chance of being on the potential win radar. All the while, we were shocked and honored to win the University Award Prize. 

**CINI - Next Generation Film Camera**

&gt;It was totally unexpected! While we were confident that CINI will reinvent the photo NFT space but didn’t yet have a clue about its market acceptance. It’s amazing feedback for CINI to be recognized by the Solana Foundation within a pool of talented teams and projects from the Summer Camp Hackathon.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***2. Tell us a little bit about your team (how could we miss this question), something interesting beyond what you’ve already mentioned in your presentation or project description. Maybe some fun facts, or your hidden talents 🤔*** *//* *My personal favourite question ;)*

**Dual Finance**

&gt;The founders met playing lacrosse at MIT.

**Tensor Trade**

&gt;We (Ilja and I) were complete strangers living on opposite sides of the world 6 months ago. We both found each other through YC's co-founder matching portal, struck it off with our first trial project (Tensor NFT oracle), and the rest is history :) 

**DreamOS**

&gt;We're the Dream Team!  
&gt;  
&gt;We have a very young team, I'm the oldest person on our team at 28, my two co-founders are 22 and 18.  
&gt;  
&gt;We aren't like other startups, we don't have deep industry experience in our sector, we just have a really good idea and a dream. We also actually care about our users.  
&gt;  
&gt;We aren't obsessed with extracting value. I just want to build the tools that blockchain users have been LACKING for so long for whatever reason.   
&gt;  
&gt;Web3 has a massive UX problem, and yet we have more devs building coin flip games on Solana than working on UX! It's mind boggling.

**Monstrè**

&gt;CM, the co-founder of Monstrè is an animal lover. We initially started as an animal-centric NFT project, to fundraise for the local Animal Welfare Groups and also raise awareness for animal protection. There were people in the local community who wanted to support us but found on-boarding too much of friction. So we decided to join the hackathon to solve this particular pain point. 

**Better Call Sol**

&gt;Lab Eleven is a team of Australian web3 engineers, split between Melbourne and Sydney. We've known each other through our past careers, where we built some pretty complex solutions for a diverse set of clients. We're now bringing all that experience and focusing it on Solana. We'll be at Breakpoint so come say hi or just stare from a distance, whatever is your speed. ^(Our Jane will be there too, btw ;))

**the100**

&gt;We're a team of creatives who love art and tech! For whatever reason, there seems to be a lot of this type in Solana - if you're one of them, come join us!

**CandyPay**

&gt;We are a team of young builders who love building cool projects instead of studying in school xD  
&gt;  
&gt;Fun fact here will be we all are under 18 yrs and haven't passed the legal age yet, some just finished high school and others have entered recently. So it's a roller coaster ride of handling school, exams, building, bugs, and stuff. Time management and keeping production up and running were the hardest part, as there might have been some server issues cause of excess usage and our backend friend might be in school to handle them, so we all kept learning new things every day to keep the ship running!   
&gt;  
&gt;We have certainly grown out of that stage and have learned a lot more than any school or job could teach us in this short timeframe :)

**Lulo**

&gt;Lulo was inspired at the Miami Hacker House

**Dao Chat**

&gt;The team was made up of two students, Bruno and Nick, however it doesn’t feel right saying it was just us two because we couldn’t have built Dao Chat if it weren’t for many other Solana devs giving us advice, ideas and technical help. A fun fact is that we’ve been playing on the same football team for the past 6 years. 

**SolStamps**

&gt;James is a professional fly fisherman and was on the National United States Youth Fly Fishing Team. Ryan is highly talented at the exquisite art of jumping jacks. 

**CINI - Next Generation Film Camera**

&gt;In the initial dApp demo, Dan recorded CINI’s capture-and-develop flow to show the team internally. While there were no issues with the demo itself, however since it captured the chaotic state of his room, the team in unison refused to use that version! Now it wouldn’t have been a good idea to show the world, would it?  
&gt;  
&gt;In the spirit of web3, our team is fully remote. We had teammates based in Berlin, Vancouver and Taipei during the hackathon. Working with time zones across three continents was definitely a challenge. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***3. What brought you to the Solana Ecosystem?*** 

**Dual Finance**

&gt;Cheap rent &amp; fast transactions with full on-chain CLOB's like Serum &amp; Mango Markets to build atop. Also a sense that Solana token projects were in the greatest need of better token incentive structures.

**Tensor Trade**

&gt;(1) How cheap it was to experiment and send transactions directly to mainnet and (2) the compelling compute model and (3) using Rust. Most of these are technological reasons but this matters a ton when you're trying to build a low-latency, real-time NFT trading platform where real-time actually matters when finality is sub 1-second.

**DreamOS**

&gt;NFTs.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bored Apes had just minted a couple months prior, and everyone was getting into NFT's. The first NFT I ever purchased was a Solarian, and the first NFT I ever minted was a Degenerate Ape Academy.  
&gt;  
&gt;So I spent the better part of a year just minting and flipping NFT's, looking back it feels like a massive waste of time. But super grateful to be here, to meet the people I did in NFT's, and now to be building tools for NFTs.

**Monstrè**

&gt;The awesome community and developer tooling available. Transaction fees are also very low.

**Better Call Sol**

&gt;We wrote a [whole blog](https://blog.labeleven.dev/why-solana) about this! But let's face it, people rather skim a twitter thread so here you go: [https://twitter.com/yaamehn/status/1537187253893550081](https://twitter.com/yaamehn/status/1537187253893550081) 

**The100**

&gt;I'm most excited by the idea of blockchain as ""code legos"" / an entirely new way to build software that harnesses the internet's ""hive mind."" Solana, with its high speed and monolithic blockchain, seems best suited towards this endeavor.

**CandyPay**

&gt;Superteam DAO and the ample opportunities Solana has brought for young builders were the forces that attracted us to the Solana Ecosystem. 

**Lulo**

&gt;Low fees, High throughput, it's fun building in an environment like that.

**Dao Chat**

&gt;The first line of Web3 code I wrote was for the Solana blockchain by chance due to a random tutorial I had watched, but since then, I still haven’t found a single reason or need to leave the ecosystem or join a new one. 

**SolStamps**

&gt;Good question. Upon framing a proposed idea for SolStamps, we quickly realized that our software would require a blockchain to support its ability to drive a massive number of transactions in a timely manner. The reputation of the Solana Ecosystem is scalability and speed, a perfect match for a high-volume service such as email. Furthermore, from a monetization outlook, unlike other chains with enormous gas fees, the .00025 average cost per transaction allows us to offer our service at a reasonable price while maintaining a considerable margin.

**CINI - Next Generation Film Camera**

&gt;The Solana ecosystem is the optimal fit for CINI, due to its impressive track record with the play-to-earn model and NFTs. On top of that, with the launch of Saga, the first dapp native phone, it would create a seamless user experience.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***4. How will your project enrich Solana ecosystem and make it better?***

**Dual Finance** 

&gt;Providing sustainable &amp; aligned incentive structures for other token projects. Goodbye inflationary rewards. Hello Staking Options.

**Tensor Trade**

&gt;We want to make NFTs as liquid as Dogecoin, and we think we can do it by providing a better trading experience to traders who are used to sub-second, real-time DeFi trading.  
&gt;  
&gt;We are working on a number of new primitives &amp; protocols that will hopefully make NFTs 100x more liquid. For example, we launched TensorSwap, the fastest NFT AMM on Solana, just a few weeks after we wrapped up Tensor Trade :)

**DreamOS**

&gt;Well, the problem currently is that Solana is, for the lack of a better phrase, """"homeless"""". Or if you prefer, Solana lives in a cardboard box named Phantom. And that box is small and only has 1 room.  
&gt;  
&gt;What we're doing is we're building a Home for web3 - with endless rooms for all your different web3 activities, such as marketplaces, DeFi, NFT organization -  
&gt;  
&gt;I've been on Solana for over a year now, and we still don't have tools to even VIEW your NFTs, most people still go to Magic Eden to look at their NFT's and portfolio value - this is kind of like going to the grocery store to see what food you have in your fridge.   
&gt;  
&gt;So we're building all the tools that will make using crypto as easy as using your desktop computer or accessing your bank account, from your home.

**Monstrè**

&gt;We will make it easy for people to get from zero to one onto Solana with very little friction. Our hero product, the USDC Gift Cards, will redefine remittance, crypto commerce as well accessibility to DeFi.

**Better Call Sol**

&gt;Better Call Sol was created to better the Solana development experience and provide a more interactive way of educating users on how to use the chain. It was created as a public good and was open-sourced right away. Lowering the barrier to entry for developers is huge step in ecosystem adoption. Next time, you just want to run a quick ad-hoc transaction against the chain, remember to Better Call Sol!

**the100**

&gt;We're aiming to build a product that is engaging but also incredibly simple that reaches users who don't know how to use crypto. And then if those users want to go deeper and say, become a channel owner, \*then\* they'll need to learn how it all works, which is great for the ecosystem.

**CandyPay**

&gt;Mobile native web3 experiences are still very early and unbearable for users. Solana has been working on this direction with Saga Phone and we are here to double down on this movement! Our mission is to serve Solana Ecosystem users in a way they feel familiar with and convenient while using solana in their everyday life.  
&gt;  
&gt;When they Mint NFTs the experience should be smooth and fast without relying on desktops all the time, and that's what we have achieved using QR Codes and Tap to Mint user flows  
&gt;  
&gt;In the coming time, we are launching our first Payment product and it will change how people currently transact with Cryptocurrencies. Built on Solana Pay, we will be powering a '1-Click Tap to Pay' payment experience which will be on par with GPay, and Apple pay, tailored for web3 users and merchants, it will be a seamless, fast, cost-efficient method to pay and merchants can reach a global audience while earning more compared to traditional payment rails. This will set a new standard for payments in web3 and we ought to make Solana the best user-centric chain, with CandyPay powering creators with the best no-code, low-code solutions   
&gt;  
&gt;This way we feel in the coming time, CandyPay will hold a special place in users' hearts and will have a great impact on Solana Ecosystem as a whole!

**Lulo**

&gt;Toly has been pretty vocal about rebuilding DeFi using order books.  We aim to become the lending/borrowing component of that rebuild :) 

**Dao Chat**

&gt;Dao Chat isn’t meant to work alone as we describe it in our video, it is more of a missing puzzle piece and tool which will add to the decentralisation and independence of DAOs. 

**SolStamps**

&gt;Every user of SolStamps interacts with the Solana Blockchain. Even though SolStamps is a blockchain-based company, we are not targeting the Web3 community. We created our software for anyone looking to secure their email: bankers, lawyers, financial advisors, escrow agents, psychologists, and even the average internet user. Designing our product in this way directly connects people who would likely never interact with Web3 to the Solana blockchain. The consequence: we're spreading the reach of the Solana platform and the security offered to an entirely new demographic of users. 

**CINI - Next Generation Film Camera**

&gt;Web3 adoption still faces many challenges, especially with non-crypto users. Solana is one of the fastest-growing ecosystems within web3, however, its current infrastructure and applications are not friendly to the average mom and pop. Take StepN for example, they are one of the first protocols that created such massive waves outside of the web3 space and users. This is what we aim to achieve with CINI - to make it more accessible for everyday users, before being a capture-and-earn product.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***5. What have you got from the hackathon aside from the prize money and possible future fame and success?***

**Dual Finance**

&gt;Acknowledgement that what we're building is worthwhile &amp; momentum on our fund raise.

**Tensor Trade**

&gt;We were able to connect with a number of other projects in this space (including you guys!) ^(thanks! :)) Looking forward to meeting more hackathon winners in the coming days.

**DreamOS**

&gt;We actually haven't received our prize money yet  
&gt;  
&gt;We did get reached out to by several VC's

**Monstrè**

&gt;Connections to the Solana Foundation and access to knowledgeable and talented engineers and founders.

**Better Call Sol**

&gt;Working on an idea from inception to execution in a short period of time is exhilarating. Winning the prize also validates our thinking and motivates us to push our project further. It has been great to be able to show the ecosystem what we are capable of. 

**the100**

&gt;I've met some great people! I've been reading Packy McCormick's awesome newsletter, Not Boring, for quite some time and had the opportunity to pitch to him - really cool.

**CandyPay**

&gt;In the initial days when we used to approach projects for a potential partnership, most of them used to think of us as a scam or fake promise as we didn't have much social credibility and the promise of completely removing 'connect wallet' from user's life and powering a ""Tap to Mint' seamless user experience was a big shift and most didn't actually understood it well. This hackathon win gave us what we needed the most -- Social Credibility and a clear sign that not only Mobile native UX is the need of the hour, but our execution is also going in the right direction to serve the users :)

**Lulo**

&gt;Credibility is probably the most valuable thing.  We've had a lot more inbound interest for partnerships due to the hackathon.

**Dao Chat**

&gt;Above everything, motivation is what we received, backed by confidence, and these are the most valuable assets a developer can have. 

**SolStamps**

&gt;First and foremost, the competition validated the idea of a Web3-centric identity-based cybersecurity software. Since validating the authenticity of an email using digital identities is a relatively new concept, we found it reassuring to be credited by these esteemed judges. Second, the victory is a validation of our idea that should help in our fundraising efforts. 

**CINI - Next Generation Film Camera**

&gt;Coming up with the idea for CINI would not have happened without the hackathon! We thought it would be a fun experience to join one on a global scale. After several brainstorming sessions, we came up with the idea for CINI which we were all excited about. Plus, nothing beats the high and momentum of completing a project from start to finish! There were so many times during the hackathon when we were unsure if we would make it to the finish line. It’s also been great to connect with talented people within the industry to learn more about all things on how to build a product. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***6. How was it - launching a project in a bear market?***

**Dual Finance**

&gt;Great environment to build the right way. We don't need to rush to production or try to over market the products. The people still around today get the value proposition.

**Tensor Trade**

&gt;Launching an MVP/early stage project in a bear market is the best thing you can do.  
&gt;  
&gt;There's 10x less noise and hype that frankly dilutes projects that are actually pursuing something of substance. In a bear market, you know if your product has traction or if it's just riding on momentary hype that will fade away over time.

**DreamOS**

&gt;Stressful - we are launching an NFT called breadheads ahead of the official DreamOS rollout, and when the bear market hit, the activity got so low on twitter and discord, it was pretty discouraging.  
&gt;  
&gt;But it was a good lesson, and it was an exercise in discipline - if you can keep your head down and ignore the noise (or lack of noise), and focus on the problem you're solving, and keep building despite negativity all around you, then you are going to make it. 

**Monstrè**

&gt;To us it does not matter as we are building infrastructure that is useful in a bear or bull market.

**Better Call Sol**

&gt;Bear market is a great time to build. There are a lot less distractions and we can get down to building some great products.

**the100**

&gt;I'm fortunate to be able to bootstrap Garden Labs with my creative agency Blanc so I mostly can ignore the crazy swings of the market.

**CandyPay**

&gt;It was tough to be true, cause there were not many projects launching in bear markets, and most of them pushed their launch date, and those who launched simply disagreed to use our minting meta as it was too new for users and they didn't want to do something creative. I feel our initial reach outs were simply not the right projects who were too conservative, but things have changed for the better recently! 

**Lulo**

&gt;It's been a grind...but that's what the bear market is for...building :) 

**Dao Chat**

&gt;It perhaps took some pressure off our backs, and really filtered out the true community team-players from others only looking for quick returns.

**SolStamps**

&gt;Thankfully, the broader economic bear market and the crypto downturn had a negligible impact on SolStamps. For the competition, we were able to self-fund the project. More notably, our software relies on people using email, which is essentially uncorrelated to economic conditions. 

**CINI - Next Generation Film Camera**

&gt;As we all know, the bear market is the best time to get BUIDL-ing. One of the biggest challenges with developing a web3 product is separating speculators from true fans. A bear market takes away the speculation and promotes reasonable expectations for web3 products. This is the ideal time to focus on building up solid products for users.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***7. What are you most excited about now after winning?***

**Dual Finance**

&gt;Growing the reach of the project &amp; continuing to build out our roadmap towards the DUAL token launch!

**Tensor Trade**

&gt;We're still fully heads-down building and working our next big product: TensorSwap. If you're looking to trade NFTs with super low fees (1% total, 0.9% goes back to creators) and want to liquidity farm your NFTs, come check out TensorSwap!

**DreamOS**

&gt;It's onto the next hackathon for us - we're going to be in Chicago for the xHack Hackathon  
&gt;  
&gt;then we are going to Lisbon for Breakpoint ^(You should definitely meat our Jane there!)   
&gt;  
&gt;but I'm most excited for after all of that - to move to New York and get our new office set up - our team is mostly remote right now but we will be convening in NY after Breakpoint :)

**Monstrè**

&gt;Getting the first users!

**Better Call Sol**

&gt;Even before winning the prize, we were keen to continue this project, expanding its scope and adding more functionalities. That has not changed, if anything now we are even more motivated. The tool is still in Alpha and plenty of potential to be explored.

**the100**

&gt;Hopefully raising some funds to help us move faster! And continuing to meet people excited about the project that want to get involved, whether that's as a creator, a user, or just to lurk on the Discord.

**CandyPay**

&gt;After winning the hackathon, we are much more energetic, motivated, and excited to push our mission of powering best ever Payments experiences in the Solana Ecosystem! We will keep scaling our NFT initiatives and have direct collaborations with launchpads and Marketplaces to serve a whole new UX to mobile native users.   
&gt;  
&gt;Meanwhile, a great focus will be on launching our first-ever payment product which will allow any online business, ecom store, or sass service already accepting credit cards to accept Solana and USDC in a seamless low code way! with this, users can pay in usdc/sol in a 1-click Tap to Pay seamless user experience, which gonna set a new standard of on-chain payments and we will change commerce on web3 forever! :D

**Lulo**

&gt;Getting back to work :), talking with other teams about their roadmaps and where we can align.

**Dao Chat**

&gt;Collaborating with other teams and amplifying our voices to other projects. 

**SolStamps**

&gt;In the next couple of months, we're beyond excited to release SolStamps V1.0 to the public and start scaling the user base. As we intend to make blockchain's decentralized, immutable, and trustless attributes accessible to any Web2 user, we redesigned the software to eliminate the more technical features included in the proof of concept (such as knowing how to set up and fund a Phantom wallet). Now, with V1.0, users can reap the benefits of the Solana blockchain without ever needing to send or receive crypto. By eliminating the need for the Phantom Wallet, only one download is necessary to send emails securely. We are also thrilled to begin a pre-seed round of financing to enable the launch of an app that will be compatible with all email services, browsers, and devices. 

**CINI - Next Generation Film Camera**

&gt;It was overwhelming to receive messages in support of CINI and their anticipation for the beta test! We’re rolling full steam ahead to get the promised MVP ready for beta test ASAP.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***8. Which project/s of other hackathon participants impressed you?***

**Dual Finance**

&gt;Excited to see what comes from our fellow Gaming &amp; Mobile track winners. We see these as major growth areas to onboard more users to Solana, who we wish to support by being the projects' incentive liquidity infrastructure provider.

**Tensor Trade**

&gt;[Ora Labs](https://twitter.com/oralabs_) is working on something that is sorely needed on Solana: would be quite excited to see their first MVP and take it for a spin.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our friends at Lulo Finance are also working on a much more market-efficient order book model for loans: keep an eye out for them!

**DreamOS**

&gt;Ora Labs was an impressive project, the blockchain search engine was a feature that we had dreamed of for DreamOS, very excited to work with their team on integrating their search engine into DreamOS.

**Monstrè**

&gt;Ora Labs for sure! Concept is unique and will make Solana Blockchain Data more accessible and easier to understand.

**Better Call Sol**

&gt;I can't speak for our whole team but personally as a developer, I am most interested in the developer tooling (you probably could have guessed from our hackathon submission). The judges seem to be aligned on this interest as we saw the grand prize go to IronForge. Along the same lines, I think Seahorse, the Python framework for writing Solana programs, will unlock a whole new block of developers and that's exciting to see.

**the100**

&gt;There's this project called Titlepool where they're basically trying to fix the film distribution industry with blockchain - it's a great project. They also own Channel 4 on the100 and are streaming a huge catalog of awesome indie film content :)

**Lulo**

&gt;Sooooo many of them.  We are friends with the IronForge, Ora, Tensor, PoolProps, folks, so it was good to see they got recognition as well. 

**SolStamps**

&gt;While our team is wildly impressed by the innovation of the winning projects and the development they bring to the Solana ecosystem and Web3 in general, the project we are most enthusiastic about is Ora: the first search engine for blockchain data. The ability to fix a preeminent issue as complex as retrieving chain-based data in a user-friendly way is fantastic. The variety of filter and search options in the Ora Transaction Viewer makes for a very palatable and informative search query. 

**CINI - Next Generation Film Camera**

&gt;The grand champion, IronForge! It’s always exciting to see dev tools to create an easier and seamless development experience and lower the barrier to developing on Solana."	everstake s interview with solana summercamp winners we ve

endless rooms for all your different web3 activities such as marketplaces defi nft organization gt gt i ve been on solana for over a year now and we still don t have tools to even view your nfts most people still go to magic eden to look at their nft s and portfolio value this is kind of like going to the grocery store to see what food you have in your fridge gt gt so we re building all the tools that will make using crypto as easy as using your desktop computer or accessing your bank account from your home monstr gt we will make it easy for people to get from zero to one onto solana with very little friction our hero product the usdc gift cards will redefine remittance crypto commerce as well accessibility to defi better call sol gt better call sol was created to better the solana development experience and provide a more interactive way of educating users on how to use the chain it was created as a public good and was open sourced right away lowering the barrier to entry for developers is huge step in ecosystem adoption next time you just want to run a quick ad hoc transaction against the chain remember to better call sol the100 gt we re aiming to build a product that is engaging but also incredibly simple that reaches users who don t know how to use crypto and then if those users want to go deeper and say become a channel owner then they ll need to learn how it all works which is great for the ecosystem candypay gt mobile native web3 experiences are still very early and unbearable for users solana has been working on this direction with saga phone and we are here to double down on this movement our mission is to serve solana ecosystem users in a way they feel familiar with and convenient while using solana in their everyday life gt gt when they mint nfts the experience should be smooth and fast without relying on desktops all the time and that s what we have achieved using qr codes and tap to mint user flows gt gt in the coming time we are launching our first payment product and it will change how people currently transact with cryptocurrencies built on solana pay we will be powering a 1 click tap to pay payment experience which will be on par with gpay and apple pay tailored for web3 users and merchants it will be a seamless fast cost efficient method to pay and merchants can reach a global audience while earning more compared to traditional payment rails this will set a new standard for payments in web3 and we ought to make solana the best user centric chain with candypay powering creators with the best no code low code solutions gt gt this way we feel in the coming time candypay will hold a special place in users hearts and will have a great impact on solana ecosystem as a whole lulo gt toly has been pretty vocal about rebuilding defi using order books we aim to become the lending borrowing component of that rebuild dao chat gt dao chat isn t meant to work alone as we describe it in our video it is more of a missing puzzle piece and tool which will add to the decentralisation and independence of daos solstamps gt every user of solstamps interacts with the solana blockchain even though solstamps is a blockchain based company we are not targeting the web3 community we created our software for anyone looking to secure their email bankers lawyers financial advisors escrow agents psychologists and even the average internet user designing our product in this way directly connects people who would likely never interact with web3 to the solana blockchain the consequence we re spreading the reach of the solana platform and the security offered to an entirely new demographic of users cini next generation film camera gt web3 adoption still faces many challenges especially with non crypto users solana is one of the fastest growing ecosystems within web3 however its current infrastructure and applications are not friendly to the average mom and pop take stepn for example they are one of the first protocols that created such massive waves outside of the web3 space and users this is what we aim to achieve with cini to make it more accessible for everyday users before being a capture and earn product amp x200b amp x200b 5 what have you got from the hackathon aside from the prize money and possible future fame and success dual finance gt acknowledgement that what we re building is worthwhile amp momentum on our fund raise tensor trade gt we were able to connect with a number of other projects in this space including you guys thanks looking forward to meeting more hackathon winners in the coming days dreamos gt we actually haven t received our prize money yet gt gt we did get reached out to by several vc s monstr gt connections to the solana foundation and access to knowledgeable and talented engineers and founders better call sol gt working on an idea from inception to execution in a short period of time is exhilarating winning the prize also validates our thinking and motivates us to push our project further it has been great to be able to show the ecosystem what we are capable of the100 gt i ve met some great people i ve been reading packy mccormick s awesome newsletter not boring for quite some time and had the opportunity to pitch to him really cool candypay gt in the initial days when we used to approach projects for a potential partnership most of them used to think of us as a scam or fake promise as we didn t have much social credibility and the promise of completely removing connect wallet from user s life and powering a tap to mint seamless user experience was a big shift and most didn t actually understood it well this hackathon win gave us what we needed the most social credibility and a clear sign that not only mobile native ux is the need of the hour but our execution is also going in the right direction to serve the users lulo gt credibility is probably the most valuable thing we ve had a lot more inbound interest for partnerships due to the hackathon dao chat gt above everything motivation is what we received backed by confidence and these are the most valuable assets a developer can have solstamps gt first and foremost the competition validated the idea of a web3 centric identity based cybersecurity software since validating the authenticity of an email using digital identities is a relatively new concept we found it reassuring to be credited by these esteemed judges second the victory is a validation of our idea that should help in our fundraising efforts cini next generation film camera gt coming up with the idea for cini would not have happened without the hackathon we thought it would be a fun experience to join one on a global scale after several brainstorming sessions we came up with the idea for cini which we were all excited about plus nothing beats the high and momentum of completing a project from start to finish there were so many times during the hackathon when we were unsure if we would make it to the finish line it s also been great to connect with talented people within the industry to learn more about all things on how to build a product amp x200b amp x200b 6 how was it launching a project in a bear market dual finance gt great environment to build the right way we don t need to rush to production or try to over market the products the people still around today get the value proposition tensor trade gt launching an mvp early stage project in a bear market is the best thing you can do gt gt there s 10x less noise and hype that frankly dilutes projects that are actually pursuing something of substance in a bear market you know if your product has traction or if it s just riding on momentary hype that will fade away over time dreamos gt stressful we are launching an nft called breadheads ahead of the official dreamos rollout and when the bear market hit the activity got so low on twitter and discord it was pretty discouraging gt gt but it was a good lesson and it was an exercise in discipline if you can keep your head down and ignore the noise or lack of noise and focus on the problem you re solving and keep building despite negativity all around you then you are going to make it monstr gt to us it does not matter as we are building infrastructure that is useful in a bear or bull market better call sol gt bear market is a great time to build there are a lot less distractions and we can get down to building some great products the100 gt i m fortunate to be able to bootstrap garden labs with my creative agency blanc so i mostly can ignore the crazy swings of the market candypay gt it was tough to be true cause there were not many projects launching in bear markets and most of them pushed their launch date and those who launched simply disagreed to use our minting meta as it was too new for users and they didn t want to do something creative i feel our initial reach outs were simply not the right projects who were too conservative but things have changed for the better recently lulo gt it s been a grind but that s what the bear market is for building dao chat gt it perhaps took some pressure off our backs and really filtered out the true community team players from others only looking for quick returns solstamps gt thankfully the broader economic bear market and the crypto downturn had a negligible impact on solstamps for the competition we were able to self fund the project more notably our software relies on people using email which is essentially uncorrelated to economic conditions cini next generation film camera gt as we all know the bear market is the best time to get buidl ing one of the biggest challenges with developing a web3 product is separating speculators from true fans a bear market takes away the speculation and promotes reasonable expectations for web3 products this is the ideal time to focus on building up solid products for users amp x200b amp x200b 7 what are you most excited about now after winning dual finance gt growing the reach of the project amp continuing to build out our roadmap towards the dual token launch tensor trade gt we re still fully heads down building and working our next big product tensorswap if you re looking to trade nfts with super low fees 1 total 0 9 goes back to creators and want to liquidity farm your nfts come check out tensorswap dreamos gt it s onto the next hackathon for us we re going to be in chicago for the xhack hackathon gt gt then we are going to lisbon for breakpoint you should definitely meat our jane there gt gt but i m most excited for after all of that to move to new york and get our new office set up our team is mostly remote right now but we will be convening in ny after breakpoint monstr gt getting the first users better call sol gt even before winning the prize we were keen to continue this project expanding its scope and adding more functionalities that has not changed if anything now we are even more motivated the tool is still in alpha and plenty of potential to be explored the100 gt hopefully raising some funds to help us move faster and continuing to meet people excited about the project that want to get involved whether that s as a creator a user or just to lurk on the discord candypay gt after winning the hackathon we are much more energetic motivated and excited to push our mission of powering best ever payments experiences in the solana ecosystem we will keep scaling our nft initiatives and have direct collaborations with launchpads and marketplaces to serve a whole new ux to mobile native users gt gt meanwhile a great focus will be on launching our first ever payment product which will allow any online business ecom store or sass service already accepting credit cards to accept solana and usdc in a seamless low code way with this users can pay in usdc sol in a 1 click tap to pay seamless user experience which gonna set a new standard of on chain payments and we will change commerce on web3 forever d lulo gt getting back to work talking with other teams about their roadmaps and where we can align dao chat gt collaborating with other teams and amplifying our voices to other projects solstamps gt in the next couple of months we re beyond excited to release solstamps v1 0 to the public and start scaling the user base as we intend to make blockchain s decentralized immutable and trustless attributes accessible to any web2 user we redesigned the software to eliminate the more technical features included in the proof of concept such as knowing how to set up and fund a phantom wallet now with v1 0 users can reap the benefits of the solana blockchain without ever needing to send or receive crypto by eliminating the need for the phantom wallet only one download is necessary to send emails securely we are also thrilled to begin a pre seed round of financing to enable the launch of an app that will be compatible with all email services browsers and devices cini next generation film camera gt it was overwhelming to receive messages in support of cini and their anticipation for the beta test we re rolling full steam ahead to get the promised mvp ready for beta test asap amp x200b amp x200b 8 which project s of other hackathon participants impressed you dual finance gt excited to see what comes from our fellow gaming amp mobile track winners we see these as major growth areas to onboard more users to solana who we wish to support by being the projects incentive liquidity infrastructure provider tensor trade gt ora labs https twitter com oralabs is working on something that is sorely needed on solana would be quite excited to see their first mvp and take it for a spin gt gt our friends at lulo finance are also working on a much more market efficient order book model for loans keep an eye out for them dreamos gt ora labs was an impressive project the blockchain search engine was a feature that we had dreamed of for dreamos very excited to work with their team on integrating their search engine into dreamos monstr gt ora labs for sure concept is unique and will make solana blockchain data more accessible and easier to understand better call sol gt i can t speak for our whole team but personally as a developer i am most interested in the developer tooling you probably could have guessed from our hackathon submission the judges seem to be aligned on this interest as we saw the grand prize go to ironforge along the same lines i think seahorse the python framework for writing solana programs will unlock a whole new block of developers and that s exciting to see the100 gt there s this project called titlepool where they re basically trying to fix the film distribution industry with blockchain it s a great project they also own channel 4 on the100 and are streaming a huge catalog of awesome indie film content lulo gt sooooo many of them we are friends with the ironforge ora tensor poolprops folks so it was good to see they got recognition as well solstamps gt while our team is wildly impressed by the innovation of the winning projects and the development they bring to the solana ecosystem and web3 in general the project we are most enthusiastic about is ora the first search engine for blockchain data the ability to fix a preeminent issue as complex as retrieving chain based data in a user friendly way is fantastic the variety of filter and search options in the ora transaction viewer makes for a very palatable and informative search query cini next generation film camera gt the grand champion ironforge it s always exciting to see dev tools to create an easier and seamless development experience and lower the barrier to developing on solana
