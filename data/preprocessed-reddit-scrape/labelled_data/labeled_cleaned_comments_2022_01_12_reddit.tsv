37	[]	False		smeggletoot			[]				text	t2_b740b	False	False	"Consumer trends are changing.  There's even a new concept called an EVP (Ethical Viable Product). 

- We've been over consuming and over producing, buying lots of crap we don't need.  We throw away nearly a third of our food in the West and the biggest ongoing public health crisis is obesity.  We have entire shipping containers all over the world stuffed full of rotting beanie babies as a monument to that over abundance.  

- The environment is collapsing and it is clear the way we have been organising the world is no longer sustainable.  This has given birth to entire new industries and market verticals (EV, vertical farms, plant based meat alternatives, non dairy milk, lab grown meat, ethical fashion, robotics, AI, web 3 and so on...)

- This means, coupled with that dramatic shift in consumer trends, old industries and businesses are being displaced at a pace we've never seen before.  Everything from silicon valley to the film industry to cattle farms and oil companies are having to adjust to those changing trends.  Crypto is just one microcosm where we're seeing that disruption in the world of finance but it's happening EVERYWHERE.  

- This creates massive supply chain shocks.  An example would be the UK running out of CO2 (as laughable as that sounds) used for slaughter, partly due to fertilizer factories receiving less demand for products (CO2 is a bi-product in the production process).  

Why is fertilizer receiving less demand?  Because of pressures being applied to make the agricultural industry move to more sustainable farming practices, helped along by the massive rewillding movement many farmers have gotten behind in the UK.  Interim result?  Nandos runs out of chicken, price of chicken in local stores increases due to reduced supply.  

This all leads to transitory inflation due to the chaos in supply/demand in markets that were hitherto stable and predictable.  

Meanwhile savvy people looking 10 years ahead to where the world is going to be are able to spot market opportunities in companies building out EVPs that will meet the needs of those changing consumer trends.

I think you basically answered that.  DYOR and form your own firm belief.  Not to say you never change your view, but it should be based on new information that changes your original assessment, not based on someone else's opinion that triggers FUD or FOMO. Be real with yourself in terms of what may happen.   

E.g. I believe in x years BTC will be worth multiples of current and that's my minimum timeline.  During that time I am likely to see at least x corrections of over 50% and many 10-20% corrections.

Am I prepared to hold through it? Am I relying on profits sooner because I am spending money needed for known life expenses? 

And there's nothing wrong with having more than one plan for different coins or investment/trading amounts.  Something like investing more significantly in a coin you have researched well and want to hold long term, whilst keeping a smaller pool of money for your side bets, trading/gambling etc.  

One thing's for sure though, if you don't DYOR you're not going to make good decisions."	f3128c1c8ca079b76072c625be69213741236bb8	True	False					0	1641930037		0	{}	hs8yche	False	t3_s1eo2p	False	True	t1_hs8wk9l	/r/Bitcoin/comments/s1eo2p/lessons_ive_learned_after_7_years_of_hodling/hs8yche/	1641930049	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]			 gt any advice on forming a plan i think you basically answered that dyor and form your own firm belief not to say you never change your view but it should be based on new information that changes your original assessment not based on someone else s opinion that triggers fud or fomo be real with yourself in terms of what may happen e g i believe in x years btc will be worth multiples of current and that s my minimum timeline during that time i am likely to see at least x corrections of over 50 and many 10 20 corrections am i prepared to hold through it am i relying on profits sooner because i am spending money needed for known life expenses and there s nothing wrong with having more than one plan for different coins or investment trading amounts something like investing more significantly in a coin you have researched well and want to hold long term whilst keeping a smaller pool of money for your side bets trading gambling etc one thing s for sure though if you don t dyor you re not going to make good decisions 	0.002823065035045147	0.9892765283584595	0.06623584777116776	0.9549497365951538	0.007876886054873466	0.3971468508243561	0.07354649901390076	8.431675837528019e-07	0.21616779267787933	0.017129776999354362

I realise I wrote an extremely long, convoluted answer, so the shorter response is: That’s close to a fair argument (if you are also including the cost of connection to the grid), but I’d argue the $10m capital would be better allocated to cheaper renewable projects which aren’t in remote, otherwise uneconomic locations. 

Long answer//

Yeah, that’s close to a fair argument, if the bitcoin mining provides the economic incentive and enables the payback for building new projects (and importantly, including the connection to the grid) that would otherwise not be possible, then could say fair enough. 

But I would probably argue that $10m capital would be better allocated to building a project in a more mature, known, accessible,and ultimately economic location. 

For example, you personally could take that $10m capital and invest it in an onshore wind farm in Texas with 5x the capacity of that equivalent $10m hydro plant in the remote location. We haven’t reached the point where obscure, remote locations are the most economic locations for new renewables. 

What the bitcoin price is doing is providing the potential, high risk return for it to work in these remote locations - but it is extremely risky. Just because someone might choose to take that risk doesn’t mean it’s optimal. That capital would be better elsewhere. Maybe bitcoin crashes permanently, maybe a new PoS coin becomes dominant, and these developers go bust. That’s wasted capital, and maybe not such a green thing after all. I’m aware I’m being overly pedantic and theoretical, but just wanted to give the other side."	ab630217b5914c259a2efe3762bf6ae163e6c50f	True	False					0	1641929534		0	{}	hs8wz5r	False	t3_s0jc7i	False	True	t1_hs2fsou	/r/Bitcoin/comments/s0jc7i/salvadoran_bitcoin_miners_powered_by_volcano/hs8wz5r/	1641929552	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]			 i realise i wrote an extremely long convoluted answer so the shorter response is that s close to a fair argument if you are also including the cost of connection to the grid but i d argue the 10m capital would be better allocated to cheaper renewable projects which aren t in remote otherwise uneconomic locations long answer yeah that s close to a fair argument if the bitcoin mining provides the economic incentive and enables the payback for building new projects and importantly including the connection to the grid that would otherwise not be possible then could say fair enough but i would probably argue that 10m capital would be better allocated to building a project in a more mature known accessible and ultimately economic location for example you personally could take that 10m capital and invest it in an onshore wind farm in texas with 5x the capacity of that equivalent 10m hydro plant in the remote location we haven t reached the point where obscure remote locations are the most economic locations for new renewables what the bitcoin price is doing is providing the potential high risk return for it to work in these remote locations but it is extremely risky just because someone might choose to take that risk doesn t mean it s optimal that capital would be better elsewhere maybe bitcoin crashes permanently maybe a new pos coin becomes dominant and these developers go bust that s wasted capital and maybe not such a green thing after all i m aware i m being overly pedantic and theoretical but just wanted to give the other side 	0.002588284434750676	0.9885516166687012	0.48918917775154114	0.017069902271032333	0.00824133399873972	0.37879082560539246	0.08313984423875809	8.536648579138273e-07	0.3769369423389435	0.03530966863036156

1BTC = 1BTC has more than one meaning, and sometimes it comes from the place of joy, and sometimes from a place of painful experience. Just thought that's worth pointing out.

But more to the point: think of it in terms of incentives. If you don't have your ""coins"" blacklisted, you don't have a reason to learn all about those pesky dangerous dark web ways to trade it like a pro shadowy supercoder.

But if you are a bit familiar with the protocol, you'll realize that you have (be it janky) tools at your disposal, but the whole network design is incredibly tipped into your favour. To oversimplify your 5$ solution would cost milions to track reasonably.

If you consider this from the perspective of a scammer, who was reported by thousands of ppl, for them using coinjoins and other options is not even a consideration.
