The longer form answer would be that we have the luxury of not having to care about people who fork our code. Being fully funded by the EF, we can focus on the needs of the Ethereum network without having to tailor for others. This in the long term is IMHO important, because we can do very wild internal changes that are good for us, but might be painful on forks that made some tweaks (e.g. one of our releases caused a consensus split in Avalanche because our snapshot data model was incompatible with their cross chain transfers).

Whilst we definitely will not make changes just to make other people's lives harder, we also will not omit a good change just because it will make some fork's life harder. Our policy is that Geth is OSS, everyone is free to fork it, but forking entails maintenance. Nobody should expect to run with our code and then have us fix issues that they encounter.

\&gt; And would it be right to assume that if there were ever changes on the roadmap that complicate alt-ecosystems roadmaps, they would just need to use an older version, fork, and work from there?

That is correct. Their options are either to minimize their changes and keep surfing the releases (e.g. Optimism), or if they do deep changes, then sooner or later they'll need a full dev team if the codebases diverge. I would really advise people to avoid doing the latter, it's insane to review PRs on Geth as is, I can't imagine how it would be to mutate our code into something else on a day to day basis."	f4ad5a3427de2fe3dd4e018cf99284cace48ef60	True	False					0	1660809338		0	{}	ikrotn1	False	t3_wpqmo1	False	True	t1_iki4c7b	/r/ethereum/comments/wpqmo1/ama_we_are_the_go_ethereum_geth_team_18_august/ikrotn1/	1660809352	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_cwe1u	False	False		the short answer is that we don t care about forks of geth the longer form answer would be that we have the luxury of not having to care about people who fork our code being fully funded by the ef we can focus on the needs of the ethereum network without having to tailor for others this in the long term is imho important because we can do very wild internal changes that are good for us but might be painful on forks that made some tweaks e g one of our releases caused a consensus split in avalanche because our snapshot data model was incompatible with their cross chain transfers whilst we definitely will not make changes just to make other people s lives harder we also will not omit a good change just because it will make some fork s life harder our policy is that geth is oss everyone is free to fork it but forking entails maintenance nobody should expect to run with our code and then have us fix issues that they encounter gt and would it be right to assume that if there were ever changes on the roadmap that complicate alt ecosystems roadmaps they would just need to use an older version fork and work from there that is correct their options are either to minimize their changes and keep surfing the releases e g optimism or if they do deep changes then sooner or later they ll need a full dev team if the codebases diverge i would really advise people to avoid doing the latter it s insane to review prs on geth as is i can t imagine how it would be to mutate our code into something else on a day to day basis 	0.0021294003818184137	0.9891954660415649	0.5773165225982666	0.010325301438570023	0.007345499936491251	0.5028079152107239	0.06424149870872498	8.41262419726263e-07	0.22684788703918457	0.015314586460590363

Luckily we've managed to figure out a version that seems to work well and we can ship in in a few months (we figured out how to do it a long time ago, but it needed a new data model, which was incompatible with fast sync, so we needed  a new sync (snap sync), but that needed a new acceleration structure (snapshots)).

My guess is that there will be a few protocol updates afterwards on the EVM level, getting rid of SELFDESTRUCT, adding support for withdrawals, hopefully blob transactions to help L2s a lot. These I think are all realistic for early next year.

The loosely organized nature.

\&gt; What do you dislike about working at the EF?

The loosely organized nature.

:P

\---

The EF admittedly changed a lot in these past 8 years. Originally it was a very tight nit group of mostly programmers mostly working on exactly the same things. This meant that it was very easy to pick up conversations with people and everybody knew everyone else (except the board members, we don't talk about them ;P ).

Currently there are many teams working on many things and it's not always obvious who to reach and how if you want something resolved. Of course the upside of this is that there are a lot more people helping out with non-programming stuff too, so you have a higher chance of getting your problems heard vs. when you had to talk to the CEO for a plane ticket :).

On coding side, EF became much ""less relevant"", in that most developments happening in Ethereum world happens on the outside. I guess this can be called a success for the ecosystem, but it does make working here feel like being a bit out of the loop, since all the cool stuff happens on top of the platform. Sometimes I feel that it would be nice if EF also had some interesting projects on top, not just at the protocol level.

The code is already functional and works well, we're now in the process of gradually picking it apart and merging it in in smaller batches of PRs to keep the review manageable. The original branch/PR is here if you want to take a look at the full code [https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25085](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25085), though it's bitrot heavily compared to master where we're cherry picking parts of it.

I'm not 100% aware of how other clients are doing pruning, but some parts of it is definitely similar to how Erigon or Besu are handling reorgs.

Specifically, the change we're making is that instead of maintaining many state tries in the database, we will only be maintaining 1 (+ the genesis). That one persistent state trie will be for the block \`HEAD-128\`. On top of this, we will maintain 128 in-memory diff layers, so if there are small reorgs, we can switch between braches without needing to rerun older blocks. Every time a new block is imported, the \`#HEAD-128\` is flattened into the persistent trie. Note, this is already how our snapshots work for snap sync, the new code reuses the same ideas and mechanisms.

In order to handle reorgs deeper than 128 (super bad for the network, but we can imagine scenarios where a consensus bug slips in and an upgraded node might need to undo a few K blocks to get on the correct chain), we will maintain a rolling list of 90000 ""reverse diffs"" (90K is about 2 weeks worth of blocks).

30	[]	False		karalabe				Ethereum Foundation - Péter Szilágyi	dark	"Hmmm, bad shutdowns should not lead to database corruptions. If leveldb says some file is corrupted, that usually means some checksum is invalid, as in the data was written, but incorrectly. LevelDB uses journalling, so partial writes would either be fully finished on restart or rolled back, but they should not end up in a corruption ever. My only hunch if there's a legit corruption is that the disk might be reading it's end of life.

From Geth's perspective, an unclean shutdown means that some dirty state that was kept in memory isn't flushed to disk, so the most recent blocks need to be rolled back to the point where the entire state associated with a block is available. This is annoying, but Geth should fully recover.

It can of course also happen that Geth crashes/is killed whilst doing a sequence of database writes (e.g. block processing and writing headers, bodies, receipts, etc). In that case however again, Geth should be able to recover because we always write all the data first and only then bump the ""current block"" marker.

TL;DR: If leveldb doesn't report a corruption and Geth cannot recover, that's a bug (note, rerunning 30K blocks is correct - alas annoying - behavior). If Leveldb itself fails to open the database reporting some corruption, that's out of our control and is either a leveldb bug, or a disk fault.

In the mid term, we're switching over to Pebble as our storage engine and also shipping pruning with a new trie data model. That will not require this in-memory dirty dataset, so once those are in, Geth should not need to rerun a significant number of blocks after a crash."	9c8e0cfa0110028c3714e9c22c51b2c512c2c2b5	True	False					0	1660806437		0	{}	ikrl5pz	False	t3_wpqmo1	False	True	t1_iki5qb4	/r/ethereum/comments/wpqmo1/ama_we_are_the_go_ethereum_geth_team_18_august/ikrl5pz/	1660806451	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_cwe1u	False	False		hmmm bad shutdowns should not lead to database corruptions if leveldb says some file is corrupted that usually means some checksum is invalid as in the data was written but incorrectly leveldb uses journalling so partial writes would either be fully finished on restart or rolled back but they should not end up in a corruption ever my only hunch if there s a legit corruption is that the disk might be reading it s end of life from geth s perspective an unclean shutdown means that some dirty state that was kept in memory isn t flushed to disk so the most recent blocks need to be rolled back to the point where the entire state associated with a block is available this is annoying but geth should fully recover it can of course also happen that geth crashes is killed whilst doing a sequence of database writes e g block processing and writing headers bodies receipts etc in that case however again geth should be able to recover because we always write all the data first and only then bump the current block marker tl dr if leveldb doesn t report a corruption and geth cannot recover that s a bug note rerunning 30k blocks is correct alas annoying behavior if leveldb itself fails to open the database reporting some corruption that s out of our control and is either a leveldb bug or a disk fault in the mid term we re switching over to pebble as our storage engine and also shipping pruning with a new trie data model that will not require this in memory dirty dataset so once those are in geth should not need to rerun a significant number of blocks after a crash 	0.0023243508767336607	0.988410234451294	0.4216572940349579	0.018276706337928772	0.007805896922945976	0.2547324299812317	0.07764577865600586	8.67684718741657e-07	0.41396358609199524	0.005639100447297096

122	[]	False		cannedshrimp						"1. POW energy usage is a small percentage of the global footprint and all many of the mainstream models that project future growth use terrible assumptions (see critiques of Digiconimist). The basis of most arguments is that POW is not worth the energy expenditure, but that is subjective and a different discussion. 
2. Energy usage is not inherently bad for the environment. Energy source is a key factor. Mining tends to use a higher percentage of green energy than most industries. 
3. There are many developing opportunities that POW can actually help renewable. Demand response (as a flexible load), mining to increase gas flaring efficiency and decrease pollutants, mining to capture leaking methane from landfills, mining as a first buyer for energy systems that are developing, but are not yet allowed to hook up to the grid (of which there are many and will be more as we transition). 

Most mainstream predictions made about proof of work 4-5 years ago proved to be so kind-numbingly wrong (like using more energy than the rest of the world by 2020) that it shouldn’t be a surprise that the basic “POW bad” arguments are not well fleshed out.

Fundamentally, energy usage is not a problem if it’s clean and the real question needs to be net carbon intensity, but there are strong arguments to be made that POW can help to reduce carbon intensity via monetary incentives.

If you don't want to include the transaction from that guy that stole your lunch money 20 years ago, you're free to ignore it.  Someone else will pick it up.

But if some large entity starts to attack the protocol and prevents other validators from doing their job by not attesting to the latest valid block or not building on the latest valid block and it has the majority stake on their side, then a UASF may become necessary.

This is not true. It is a claim for an amount equal to your original deposit, but because ETH uses an account system it is not possible to receive “your” coins as this concept does not exist in the protocol. The system only works because you are mixing your coins with others actively.

Systems such as Monero (which pre-dates TC by several years) are legally acceptable as they:

1) don’t require active coordination with other users to work (i.e. you don’t have to worry about there being enough ETH in the pool to conceal your transactions)

2) Don’t actually mix funds, so it can be easily proven no coordination took place

Number 2) is essentially important as it is how it is even possible to sanction TC in the first place.

If the chain ID is the same and you don't use up any nonces, a transaction created on the PoW fork will be identical in every way to a transaction created on the PoS chain, and if someone wanted they could broadcast that transaction to the PoS chain and it would be valid.

So, if you tried to sell all your SNXw for ETHw, someone could replay that TX and sell all your SNX for ETH. The resulting ETH would still be in your wallet but you probably didn't want to sell that SNX. This would be even worse with an NFT since you could just buy back the SNX, but NFTs aren't so easy to reacquire.

269	[]	False		genge-kusama						"The current situation with Acala has shown some potential issues. While Polkadot allows for secure communication between equally strongly secured networks, the issue of inner and different blockchains communicating persists if an issue (such as a ""missconfiguration"" ) happens on a specific parachain, in which case, the other parachains have no say other than deciding to trust or distrust the parachain pervious to that mistake, as they currently can't force a quality process on the other parachains.  
I imagine it's not the place of polkadot to control this, but maybe some kind of community/parachains auditing (like an auditing dedicated parachain or community), or some kind of metrics following the quality of different parachains would help.

Validators cannot ""steal"" your bonded DOT. However, if you are actively nominating a validator who commits an offense, you - and they - will be [slashed](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-staking#slashing). This would mean that a percentage of your bonded DOT would be locked and eventually sent to the Treasury (there is a delay for the Council to overrule this, if for instance the slashing was due to a software bug).

This is one of the reasons that you need to look closely at which validators you are nominating. We have an entire guide for this on the Polkadot Wiki here: [https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nominator#what-to-take-into-consideration-when-nominating](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nominator#what-to-take-into-consideration-when-nominating) Of special note is the self-stake of the validator.  Slashes are the same percentage regardless of stake.
