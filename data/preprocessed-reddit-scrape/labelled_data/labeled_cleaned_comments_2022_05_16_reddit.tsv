Nobody outside Russia knows the availability of Bitcoin in Russia in the current circumstances. Your students need to work this out, and then tell you

&gt; send them to me

That's what Bitcoin is for. Nobody can stop a Bitcoin transaction. Make sure you use your own wallet. An exchange account is not a wallet

&gt; for me to then sell the bitcoins immediately

Set up an exchange account  
https://outwittrade.com/australian-cryptocurrency-exchanges/  
(or ftx.com which is not in that set of reviews)  

Receive Bitcoin to your wallet. Send from wallet to exchange account. Sell. Withdraw AUD to your bank account

&gt; Would I lose any money in the process

You're paying a Bitcoin network fee, about 20 cents to send coins from your wallet to your exchange account. And you're paying a trading fee, from 0.08% to 0.6% depending on the exchange. Bitcoin deposit to exchange is free. AUD withdrawal from exchange is free

&gt; $50 worth of bitcoins

It doesn't work like that. There's no such animal as $50 of Bitcoin. Also, you have no knowledge of the fees paid by the students to buy Bitcoin  

To ensure you receive $50, you calculate the Bitcoin amount of your invoice using the exchange rate at the exchange you're using for selling, and ask the student to send that amount of Bitcoin  

Then your only costs are the 20-cent fee and the 0.1% fee. And if the student takes too long to send the Bitcoin, you risk a loss from price falls. Ask them to pay within 2 hours. Tell them the amount will change if they don't pay within 2 hours  

&gt; Which websites are Russians still able to use?

And what are the limits, what is the price, does the unstable Ruble make it costly to buy Bitcoin, do some banks work and others not work? You're not there to understand the effects of the war, sanctions and the devaluation of the Ruble on their ability to buy Bitcoin. They have to do this research. I suggest they should pay from a bank account, not a card"	a41929f650e0a8e48183549b62fc087fac15a6ba	True	False					0	1652615935		0	{}	i8oq3bh	False	t3_upcq82	False	True	t3_upcq82	/r/Bitcoin/comments/upcq82/using_bitcoin_to_receive_payments_from_students/i8oq3bh/	1652615952	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]		 gt is it possible for them to buy bitcoins nobody outside russia knows the availability of bitcoin in russia in the current circumstances your students need to work this out and then tell you gt send them to me that s what bitcoin is for nobody can stop a bitcoin transaction make sure you use your own wallet an exchange account is not a wallet gt for me to then sell the bitcoins immediately set up an exchange account https outwittrade com australian cryptocurrency exchanges or ftx com which is not in that set of reviews receive bitcoin to your wallet send from wallet to exchange account sell withdraw aud to your bank account gt would i lose any money in the process you re paying a bitcoin network fee about 20 cents to send coins from your wallet to your exchange account and you re paying a trading fee from 0 08 to 0 6 depending on the exchange bitcoin deposit to exchange is free aud withdrawal from exchange is free gt 50 worth of bitcoins it doesn t work like that there s no such animal as 50 of bitcoin also you have no knowledge of the fees paid by the students to buy bitcoin to ensure you receive 50 you calculate the bitcoin amount of your invoice using the exchange rate at the exchange you re using for selling and ask the student to send that amount of bitcoin then your only costs are the 20 cent fee and the 0 1 fee and if the student takes too long to send the bitcoin you risk a loss from price falls ask them to pay within 2 hours tell them the amount will change if they don t pay within 2 hours gt which websites are russians still able to use and what are the limits what is the price does the unstable ruble make it costly to buy bitcoin do some banks work and others not work you re not there to understand the effects of the war sanctions and the devaluation of the ruble on their ability to buy bitcoin they have to do this research i suggest they should pay from a bank account not a card	0.0021240815985947847	0.9894077777862549	0.8354284167289734	0.9663415551185608	0.007501749787479639	0.25328004360198975	0.0686037465929985	7.280415843524679e-07	0.286391943693161	0.0031845823395997286

Who decides what 'alt coins' are deemed to have relevance and advantage over BTC? The market has spoken- BTC is 44% Market cap. 

As I have already said and you have ignored- just go to look at r/NZBitcoin if you want to see a live example of what total shit fuckery death spiral occurs when the mods of a Bitcoin community open the door to shitcoin touting. That community is now completely fkd.

The ideology in the model shown in ops post assumes freedom and equality of individuals participating in the economy, and free choice of exchanges taking place. This is (more or less) the case now, but IT HAS NEVER BEEN THE CASE IN THE HISTORY. if you study the social structures of historical societies you will see money as a mere justification/tool for extraction of rent vassalism/feudalism/slave-powered capitalism up until middle of the last century. This is when ruling classes understood that to continue exercising control over masses you need to implement Fiat money, debased and have institutions like IMF, WB and monetary policy bodies. Through inflation they control how much of the value of your work ends up in their hands.

Bitcoin is actually an existential crisis to them, finally a free medium of exchange of value.

Exchanges charge whatever fee they like for withdrawals. They set it far higher than network fees. When you “own” bitcoin in an exchange you don’t really own anything. Just a number in the exchange’s database saying how much bitcoin you have. The actual bitcoin is in a master wallet alongside many others. When you withdraw from the exchange, the desired amount of bitcoin is transferred into a new address for which you control the key. 

Bitcoin has network fees because space in each block is limited. These fees go up and down with network usage but they are generally very low.

A house, for example, has a value that you could cash out of you needed to spend your money, but it'll take too long, so we don't call houses money. Cash can be spent immediately, so we call cash money.

When we get into gray areas is things that aren't expected to be immediately spent. M1 is cash and checking accounts, that's all immediate money. M2 is m1 + savings accounts and money market accounts, which are in theory somewhat about investing and not going to move as much. M3 includes things with set time lengths to their investments, like CDs.

For the most part people talk about m1 or m1 + M2 for the monetary supply.
