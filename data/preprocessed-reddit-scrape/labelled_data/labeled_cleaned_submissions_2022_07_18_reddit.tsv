I work for a power utility company and deal with grid enhancements as a profession. I am also a Crypto/Bitcoin enthusiast.

Lately I've been seeing a lot of chatter about the ways Bitcoin can stabilize the grid, essentially taking excess energy (that would otherwise be wasted) and put that towards the Bitcoin protocol. However, one simple question, why could this energy not be stored in say a battery storage system, or hydro/gravity storage? I want to like the Bitcoin Mining to help the grid idea, but I don't buy it yet.

See below, thread claims that the Bitcoin mining can help stabilize the grid. While this is not necessarily wrong, this energy could just be stored as well... demand response systems are also vastly improving, so the idea of ""we have excess energy we can't use"" idea is going out the window and fast.

Again, this isn't really a concern for where I work anyway (Southeastern USA). The below says you need to maintain the 60Hz, which is true, but it isn't as drastic as the thread makes it sound.

Below is a graph from Berkeley on negative pricing of energy. Basically, the utility company pays you to take energy because they have excess. We see this in the Midwest mostly (not my area of work, as I work in Southeastern USA).

I don't understand yet how, or if, Bitcoin can solve these issues. I think it would be cool for Bitcoin to use all that excess energy, but in a more practical case it will most likely be stored in energy management systems or local smart grids.

For a moment, imagine you discovered Atlantis, nobody else here. You see ancient technology and knowledge far superior to in the outside world. What would you do?

Think for one second how often money fluctuates? Right very frequently and like every auction-market we have to go up and down to find true value.

Let's take some constant, like ""1 meter."" The ""meter"" is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second.

Since the speed of light does not change, the length light travels in that time in a vacuum does not change. Therefore, the meter is an unchanging and permanently fixed constant backed by physics and mathematics, i.e. ""1 meter = 1 meter.""

If the speed of light were somehow centrally planned and constantly changing (read: inflating), then 1 meter would not be a reliable and we could not measure length effectively. Buildings could not be built and no one would be able to communicate distance. You can substitute the meter with any other mathematical constant to illustrate the same concept.

Similarly, a ""bitcoin"" can be defined as a single token out of 21 million. Since the cap cannot change, a bitcoin is also a permanently fixed constant backed by physics and cryptography, i.e. ""1 btc = 1 btc.""

The same cannot be said of the dollar, as it is one unit out of a forever increasing total, centrally planned supply. This is similar to the speed of light always changing, messing with the ""meter"" definition and our ability to measure. The changing inconsistency of the dollar leads to distortion in ""measurements"" (read: prices) that is destructive to society - which bitcoin remedies.

It is the first constant in the field of economics. The importance of this can hardly be overstated.

tl;dr: The ""1 btc = 1 btc"" does NOT mean how much a btc is valued in fiat, nor does it indicate how much a bitcoin can buy, nor is it a tongue-in-cheek tautology. It's a phrase indicating the fixed, mathematical, physically-tethered nature of bitcoin."

Food, gas, housing, etc going through the roof and the only thing not going up is the market and our paycheques. A few days ago the US cpi data was pretty horrendous at 9.1%. Will inflation ever go back to the “normal” 2-3% it used to be or is this just a hyper inflationary abyss with no end in sight? If we ever do get back down to normal how long would it take? Is the only way out of this to raise rates to the sky and create a deflationary bust resulting in -80%+ in  btc?

I have a pretty typical scenario of wanting to encourage some behavior, and to do so, new tokens are minted whenever the behavior happens. This is similar to typical blockchain mining protocols (e.g. a node solves the challenge, and is rewarded 0.25 BTC).

**What I am struggling with is**: how to maintain this kind of awardance strategy *without* greatly inflating the supply overtime.

I believe the best way to counter-act this kind of inflation would be to exponentially (or logorithmically) decrease the mint reward overtime. At least then, the inflation rate is always going down which would be acceptable.

But my use-case has one even more particular property that makes this exceeding tricky: the rewardable amount is non-static and can be arbitrary. For example, a node solving a challenge may get 0.25 BTC, and the next solver may get 2.75 BTC, and the next may get 0.10 BTC.

Is there any counter-inflation strategy for periodic, dynamic rewards like this?

Over 95% of staked SOL is delegated to individual validators instead of with a liquid stake pool. There are real risks to liquid
stake pools (risk of depeg, namely) but also real risks to delegating to a single validator (slashing, namely). So why is the proportion so skewed?

Monverse, the monster combat centric, RPG + strategy game is launching its first presale on pink sale this SUNDAY 17/07/2022 14:00UTC.

The Monvesta virus project, which is expected to have spread across the blockchain networks, is to be defeated by the warriors and archers in the game. These defenders will compete and capture monsters from different blockchains, and trade them afterwards.

The converse team is highly enthusiastic in making this game as the biggest cross-chain game to be developed. The hype around it is, attracting a lot of attention as the date of the presale is approaching.

That is why, In this article, I will focus mainly on how to engage in the presale timely to get your hands on as much $Monstr as you can.

But before talking about money, it is necessary and recommended to try the game’s testnet version and a thorough study on the entire Monverse project, before investing any money. Once you have done that, and get satisfaction (which you will, because its great). You can move to the next step.

We did some research (not an ultra scientific one, but fair enough) and realised that - Such feature could ease up the overall flow and feel towards adoption with non crypto people. 
We came up to a number of potential 200 milion users by 2024. 

It may sound like an unachievable goal, but having in mind the pace of newbies on daily basis even in bear market, supported by a 3 step easy to access &amp; participate feature. Maybe we were a bit pesimistic with the 200 mil. 

If someone told me 8, 10 years ago that I would build on a one of the biggest blockchains I would laugh probably.
