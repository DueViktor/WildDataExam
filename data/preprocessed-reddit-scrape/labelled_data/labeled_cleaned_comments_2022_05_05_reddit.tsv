You know that as Bitcoin moves to become a widespread currency only a small percentage of it's users will actually be proficient enough to understand it's code fully - which means that people who don't know still need to be allowed to vote and thus protect their money from changes that might put them at risk by taking a conservative stance. 

As for my rationale in particular? I think there is no need for the activation of BIP119, as it might be used malaciously by someone with bad intentions such as governaments or regulators. I'm no coder for sure, but it seems like a route I wouldn't like BTC to go down as a user - and the doubt should be a reason enough to oppose it's implementation, cus once it's done it's done."	cc90d73ae8124715c843f21d2bd715546bddbc3c	True	False					0	1651649219		0	{}	i79kmm0	False	t3_ugi5gh	False	True	t1_i78yp2n	/r/Bitcoin/comments/ugi5gh/daily_discussion_may_02_2022/i79kmm0/	1651649232.0	1.0	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0.0	[]		where are you getting at that people who don t know how to look at code should just stay out of the decision you know that as bitcoin moves to become a widespread currency only a small percentage of it s users will actually be proficient enough to understand it s code fully which means that people who don t know still need to be allowed to vote and thus protect their money from changes that might put them at risk by taking a conservative stance as for my rationale in particular i think there is no need for the activation of bip119 as it might be used malaciously by someone with bad intentions such as governaments or regulators i m no coder for sure but it seems like a route i wouldn t like btc to go down as a user and the doubt should be a reason enough to oppose it s implementation cus once it s done it s done 	0.0032244501635432243	0.9882041215896606	0.8182876706123352	0.05539253354072571	0.008811413310468197	0.6313210725784302	0.07072023302316666	8.663699873068254e-07	0.29499226808547974	0.010120977647602558

I see from that link I sent that vaults can be implemented without this BIP. And it has been weirdly rushed by the guy. And he’s already withdrawn from the plan of signaling right, so in a way people can be informed of that and then they will be calmer.

Also from your other comment I would avoid using the words „Satoshi’s vision“ I feel like that’s pretty loaded.

And you should never feel or take actions because of fomo.

Not a financial advise, but do your own research. Find an exchange with low fees or a P2P marketplace that fits you and feel comfortable using.
Then dollar cost average according to your original plan.

Then stick to the plan regardless, so make a viable and sensible plan from the get go.
If you know you have 100 usd to spare every single month no matter what, and don’t owe anything, set a plan to DCA weekly.

Never leave your coins to an exchange etc.
Always withdraw your coins to a wallet only you control. 

Lastly, make sure you have those seed phrases secure and backed up, just in case something happens to that wallet in order to restore it later and don’t allow anyone have access to those words, unless you want them to have access to the wallet.

Be VERY CAREFUL of scammers and imposters.
None will ask you to send them bitcoin or any coin or token, that they would then return back double. NEVER.
Never give your seed phrase to ANYONE that will ask you pretending to be some sort of support team member of that exchange/wallet or something.
Don’t try to trade your BTC in the hopes of becoming rich because some random person said use this trading strategy etc. Hodling with DCA is your safest route.

Hardest part of all this, is sticking to the plan.
Everything else has a guide of some sort to follow.

2. you can swap in multiple ways so it's not too important which stablecoin you use.
3.  Metamask is not compatible, but you can transfer assets to Solana using wormhole
4. The easiest way to stake is to head to [marinade.finance](https://marinade.finance) and stake. The staking APY is around 6% no matter what method you choose. This service gives you mSOL in exchange for staking your SOL to over 400+ validators. Not only does this help strengthen and decentralize the network, but it takes away the complications of manually staking.
