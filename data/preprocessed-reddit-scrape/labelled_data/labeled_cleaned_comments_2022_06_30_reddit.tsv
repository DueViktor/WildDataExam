If you store coins in a cold wallet, do so in such a way that, should your home burn down or the bank vault get wiped out, you do not lose them.  I think about these things for all data.

I keep data stored on a NAS in my house.  I have software to encrypt the files and back them up to cloud storage.  They're encrypted *before* they leave my house and I keep the encryption keys encrypted separately and stored in multiple locations.

I cannot prescribe the right solution for you, but think of every possible scenario and how to get your data back should the worst happen.  A good file encryption program is valuable, but make sure the password or key you use is unbreakable, but that you can still get in if all you have is your brain.

As an alternative to a strong password stored in your head, consider splitting the password into two or three pieces and given each piece to trusted friends who do not know each other.

Bitcoin just adds another layer of holes to monetary system if and when adopted. We will all be complaining after we see it get adopted. 

-each bitcoin is not fungible. Meaning, some bitcoin can be tainted and per chance you end up with that bitcoin, you will suffer. 

- it is almost impossible to obtain non kyc bitcoin. Chances are, as of now, more than 80% of the wallets have been linked to an individual by kyc on exchanges. 

-it is a piss poor system in providing financial privacy. I most definitely will not like to broadcast my past spendings to a store where i wanna make a current transaction. 

-no matter what anyone, lightning networks are centralised and have not seen the adoption we hoped it would. 10mins blocktime and 30mins confirmation time on mainnet is pretty ridiculous

-btc has no security budget after block rewards ends. Meaning miners have to rely only on tx fees to make do with their operations. That's not feasible. 

-the security of the network relies heavily on the price of btc going up every 4year cycle. Meaning miners can provide their operations and be profitable only of btc keeps going up. Wirh hashrate of network rising, the competition among the miners increase-difficulty increases- operating costs increase . And if btc prices doesnt increase, the whole security of the network falls (meaning miners have to shutdown operations ). 

-bitcoin was created to oppose the forces that uphold the fiat system. We see that it basically now succumbed to those forces and follow in their path but with more volatility.

SNA/VTAM is very complicated, even for someone that ""cut their teeth"" on the OSI model.  TCP/IP was 'bolted on' to most mainframes or their OS's to handle packet streams, while the underlying SNA network remained mostly unchanged.  

Long story short, it costs more to use end-to-end encryption over APPNs, so usually everyone is happy with tunnels or iVPN.  The cost to perform a MITM attack is outrageous, which would need to include physical access to a mainframe system or taking a VTAM systems programmer hostage.

135	[]	False		sixgod999			[]				text	t2_s5vaq	False	False	"If you look at the recent market activity then sure yes, it's failed but my framework when I think why I'm still bullish on Bitcoin is 1. We are still early and 2. Zoom out and look at its entire history, not just the latest price action.

**Store of Value / Hedge against Inflation**

If you got into Bitcoin in 2021 like half of the crypto investors, then you probably don't see the store of value then yeah you probably don't buy the store of value narrative. But thats now how markets work. Usually, markets like these are volatile in the short term but up trending in the long term. A great store of value over the past 10 - 15 years has been the general stock market, but just because we've had a couple of years where everything is down doesn't mean it's ""failed"" - your time horizon is just not long enough. Nothing goes ""up only"".

Take a look at the following chart [https://twitter.com/DylanLeClair\_/status/1396518689177063429/photo/1](https://twitter.com/DylanLeClair_/status/1396518689177063429/photo/1)

It illustrates how the gold price rose against the Weimar Mark once they got off the gold standard vs. the volatility is faced. Volatility was crazy but over the long term, price of gold in the face of hyperinflation went from 1 Weimar Mark in 1914 to 1 Trillion Marks in in 1923. Bitcoin is going through its price discovery now with immense volatility as well.

**Currency**

I will admit that yes, Bitcoin is currently not a currency as was expected but if you take a look at history, reserve currencies don't go down without a fight. In my opinion I don't necessarily think Bitcoin will replace the US dollar per se, but it will serve as an *alternative* currency that people are able to opt into. Right now yes, most people are focused on number go up so they treat it like a speculative asset and so it will act like a speculative asset. But just like gold, once it hits a certain market cap the volatility will die down and it might not be as ""stable"" as fiat but remember -&gt; short term volatility for long term growth (BTC) vs. short term stability and long term decrease in purchasing power (fiat). 

**Payment Network**

If none of the above even happen, Bitcoin (as in big ""B"" the payment network) has already succeeded. Regardless of price, you are still able to send BTC to anyone in the world 24 / 7 and in a permissionless way. Price up price down Bitcoin doesn't care - tick tock next block. 

The lightning network has allowed for fast / instant / virtually free payments.

The upcoming Taro upgrade will allow for assets to be transferred over the Bitcoin network via the lightning network which essentially eliminates the ""volatility risk"" that comes with dealing with BTC i.e. you will be able to send and receive stable coins using the bitcoin network. This alone could probably disrupt the global remittance industry which alone is valued at \~$0.8T.

In a nutshell, Bitcoin is still in its infancy. There are applications that we don't even know about that will surface because thats what happens with new technologies. When electricity was discovered, it would have been naïve to think that it would only replace candles. When the internet was first released, there's no way we could have fathomed that it would lead us to staring at small screens in our pockets to hail strangers online for a ride back home from the bar.

So, I don't know how aware of it you are, but over the years, the Ethereum ecosystem build up incredible alternative paths to finance infrastructure software projects. 

In our case, we applied and were able to land development funds through the [Ethereum Ecosystem Support Program](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/09/22/esp-grantee-roundup-aug-21/), [Moloch DAO](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x1/0x519f9662798c2e07fbd5b30c1445602320c5cf5b/proposals/4), [LIDOs LEGO Program](https://twitter.com/LidoGrants/status/1493230398108749827) and gained a [grant by the SSV network](https://forum.ssv.network/t/stereum-integration/73) DAO to integrate them as the first ever protocol into Stereum (and it makes sense, it is pretty awesome to split a validator key).  

In return we have to fulfil certain deliverables and goals we pursue, you can find a summary of them for Stereum 2.0 [\&gt;here&lt;](https://stereum.net/development/#stereum_v2). 

Then to support f.e. a more seamless client switch in Stereum (you can see it in the list), we are currently also working on another tool called SyncLink, which we build with the goal to be beneficial to the whole ecosystem independently of Stereum.    
SyncLink is basically a decentralized way to checkpoint sync nodes with each other. We partnered up with [Attestant](https://www.attestant.io/) to work on it. It is currently in its early stages.   


Another avenue of funding is also our [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/grants/1855/stereumnet-ethereum-node-setup-infrastructure) grant page, where you can donate if you like the work we do.!

Jokes aside, the DAO incident was the only such event in Ethereum's history. I am aware of at least one other event that might have been the second: the Parity Multisig Wallet had a bug that allowed someone to accidentally destroy the smart contract and freeze all assets forever. Parity requested a bailout of some sort from the community, but that did not get a majority so nothing was done.

However, this is not ""set in stone"".

The Ethereum Devs have repeatedly stated that a fork could be ultima ratio to recover from a catastrophic event (say someone somehow managed to create unlimited ETH or I don't know what). 

Against this stand the economic interests of all people dealing on Ethereum. Billions of dollars of value are settled on Ethereum every day. That means any tampering with the chain and its integrity will inevitably affect all these users and be economically very disruptive as it will be nigh impossible to undo all those transactions.

So, if there is a super-bug or super-hack that destroys Ethereum or renders it unusable or lets a malicious entity take control over the whole thing - this could be forked away (even simpler with PoS). But this won't happen for any other reason.

It was a very messy process with the result that most people (but not all! See Ethereum Classic) were in favor of taking the ETH away from the hacker with an irregular state change.

So, to your question: there is no official policy but I think the Ethereum community *may* be convinced to do another irregular state change if there was a very large amount of ETH at stake. I don't think 5% is enough though. Maybe 20%?

In any case, most people in Ethereum would be very reluctant to do it again because last time it was such a mess with so much drama. And it led to a chain split!

Nice! A good way to view it actually as it's easier to digest if you are coming from a non-technical background IMO. Since a validator that's been busted doing anything of the 3 types of slashable events (surrounding, surrounded, and double vote) really is a failed attack. The amount fund slashed on a validator participating on such an event will depend on the total number of validators that participated. Up to* 32 ETH can be slashed.

&gt; and also lose a lot of the owned coin value if the attack succeeds.

Correct. If UASF is activated and there's consensus to do so, the real Ethereum chain will still be the new one which then invalidates everything on the old one including any of the attacker's gains on it.  That unless there's a group of people that pumps life on to the hacked chain and go out of their way to even support registering it on exchanges. Yes, just like what happened on ETC. There's a reason why its very existence is an insult to Ethereum. To any one going to ETC... beware. It's not just the DAO hacker that's waiting there for you and rug pull you every time big money comes into the chain. Stupid chain needs to die.

418	[]	False		SandyBouattick			[]				text	t2_9pmke	False	False	I agree that Ripple has a good business model, and even that it could use some other token and doesn't need to use XRP.  However, Ripple has a very strong vested interest in maintaining the value of XRP as they hold a huge amount of it and use it to fund their operations.
