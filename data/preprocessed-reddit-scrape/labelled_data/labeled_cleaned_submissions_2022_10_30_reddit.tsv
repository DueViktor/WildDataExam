Warren Buffett, a renowned investor, reportedly remarked, “Be greedy when others are scared and fearful when others are greedy.”

The battered bitcoin (BTC) could soon find relief and rally to $63,000 by March 2024, when the cryptocurrency is likely to undergo mining reward halving, a programmed code designed to slow the rate of supply expansion by 50% every four years. Perhaps now is the time to be greedy in the cryptocurrency market.

## Bitcoin price hits late-2020 levels as crypto market suffers fresh.

Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, which has $10 billion in assets under control, made that most recent prediction.

The optimistic forecast is predicated on the idea that bitcoin’s price would continue to rise, as it did in the months before the July 2016 and April 2020 halvings. At both times, bitcoin had positive winds for 15 months before the halving and traded 39% higher than it did two years prior to the halving.

In light of this, if history is any indication, bitcoin’s fortunes may begin to shift starting next month and soar to $63,160 by March 2024, when it would sell for 39% more than its March 2022 price of $45,538.

## Bitcoin could go up to $63K,

Prices began to rise 15 months before the subsequent halving (in November 2022), and they typically conclude 39% higher than where they began.

""This suggests that bitcoin will trade at around $63,160 by March 2024 (March 2022 at $45,538\*(1+39%) = $63,160),” Thielen noted in the most recent Matrix on Target paper. As a result of the economic penalties, Russia has also modified its position. China and President Putin are looking for a USD replacement.

Future developments cannot be forecasted based on past performance. Nevertheless, history frequently repeats itself, and the long-term prognosis may improve soon. Recent comments from Fed officials suggested that the rate of tightening from December would be slower. In addition, Thielen claims there are indications that China is relaxing its attitude toward cryptocurrencies.

As this only occurs twice every 10 years, Thielen continued, “The timing of Hong Kong potentially allowing retail crypto trading to establish itself as a crypto center shortly shows that China is adjusting its posture towards crypto.”

“A new multi-year crypto bull market may be beginning, along with Saudi Arabia, which aspires to join the BRICS countries and is very interested in upgrading their economy into Web3,” Thielen noted.

Three reward halvings have taken place for bitcoin thus far. Following the third halving on May 12, 2020, prices surged from $8,800 to $69,000 in just 18 months.

The initial plan was for the fourth halving to occur in May 2024. The reward halving is now anticipated to occur in March 2024, however, as a result of the bear market’s dramatic increase in the hash rate, or processing power committed to mining blocks.

The per-block reward provided to miners will decrease from 6.25 BTC to 3.12 BTC following the event, lowering the inflation rate of the coin to 1.1%. Blocks are mined and transactions are verified by Bitcoin miners in exchange for payments made in BTC.

In contrast to the ever-growing fiat money supply, the cryptocurrency’s set monetary policy of halving supply expansion every four years.

Imagine how insane it will be in 1000 years if they look back at Earth as the origin of L1 that the whole species is using.

In some cases I am playing devil’s advocate somewhat and don’t necessarily support the views expressed:

The main ideas I see behind any blockchain based currency like Ethereum are Decentralization and the idea of a Currency that has a favorable inflation rate compared to most fiat currencies.

First, the idea of decentralization. How valuable is this really? Cyber attacks against US hospitals and other institutions by foreign groups have been on the news frequently. Had these institutions used block chain to store their data, would it have been more safe?

Aside from the issue of outside threats, and solely dealing with the issue of internal threats within a company, isn’t the market itself a sufficient mechanism to keep centralized institutions reasonably under control? If a business is untrustworthy with people’s data, they will soon be out of business, so are incentivized to be honest (there are of course many cases where the institutions failed- e.g. Enron and predatory lending firms in 2004). These failures, however, were the result of human decisions about the company that blockchain, which specializes in keeping track of data, could not have prevented I don’t think.

The second idea of Blockchain as a way to create currencies more stable than fiat: If we agree that centralization is not inherently bad and can work for the most part, there is no reason why a private company can’t issue it’s own currency with inflation rules that the company creates and which are voted on by the board or stock holders. Banks issued their own currency regularly in the 19th century and it seems things worked well at least for a while and I see no reason why this couldn’t work today.

So, the strongest case I see so far for a blockchain is to keep data secure from third party attacks (and I’m not even sure this is a good use case for blockchain and will rely on someone more knowledgeable in this area for that question). 

The las question, which is technical, is say we have a blockchain in use to keep a company’s data secure. A chain like ethereum requires you to pay with eth to use the blockchain. Is the reason for this a way to create a demand for eth, or are there other fundamental reasons? For example, could you have a blockchain where people pay dollars to use it?

Thanks"	main ideas behind a block chain like ethereum below are a few questions issues i wanted to discuss in some cases i am playing devil s advocate somewhat and don t necessarily support the views expressed the main ideas i see behind any blockchain based currency like ethereum are decentralization and the idea of a currency that has a favorable inflation rate compared to most fiat currencies first the idea of decentralization how valuable is this really cyber attacks against us hospitals and other institutions by foreign groups have been on the news frequently had these institutions used block chain to store their data would it have been more safe aside from the issue of outside threats and solely dealing with the issue of internal threats within a company isn t the market itself a sufficient mechanism to keep centralized institutions reasonably under control if a business is untrustworthy with people s data they will soon be out of business so are incentivized to be honest there are of course many cases where the institutions failed e g enron and predatory lending firms in 2004 these failures however were the result of human decisions about the company that blockchain which specializes in keeping track of data could not have prevented i don t think the second idea of blockchain as a way to create currencies more stable than fiat if we agree that centralization is not inherently bad and can work for the most part there is no reason why a private company can t issue it s own currency with inflation rules that the company creates and which are voted on by the board or stock holders banks issued their own currency regularly in the 19th century and it seems things worked well at least for a while and i see no reason why this couldn t work today so the strongest case i see so far for a blockchain is to keep data secure from third party attacks and i m not even sure this is a good use case for blockchain and will rely on someone more knowledgeable in this area for that question the las question which is technical is say we have a blockchain in use to keep a company s data secure a chain like ethereum requires you to pay with eth to use the blockchain is the reason for this a way to create a demand for eth or are there other fundamental reasons for example could you have a blockchain where people pay dollars to use it thanks	0.002665091771632433	0.9891071915626526	0.17945396900177002	0.0386078879237175	0.9944145679473877	0.3628779947757721	0.07637196779251099	8.35594903492165e-07	0.23442363739013672	0.009930228814482689

There has been much discussion about PBS causing potential censorship, but I am interested in how this mechanism plays out long term. I assume that over time more relays will appear. How do node operators control which relays they use? Will they even be able to tell what exactly the relays do? And should this be the job of operators to judge relays?

Putting block generation in their hands means they get a lot of power. Is it possible for a relay to just ""buy"" entire blocks on the chain monopolizing it for a short time?

Example: let's say there is a very time-critical opportunity like a highly anticipated NFT drop etc - could a relay decide to put up a high bid on just a bulk order of said NFT and crowd everyone else out?

Or, say, there is a massive gas spike. Could there be a situation where a relay could outbid others for several blocks in a row, slide in a few empty block to force gas down  and then send their own transactions, potentially net saving gas fees by leveraging their monopoly?

Crypto FUD**\n\nThe world\'s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, Binance, is releasing a new informational and educational series called ""Exposing the Five Main Halloween crypto-Creepers"", dedicated to misinformation, myths, inaccuracies and FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt). in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nWe have all witnessed the growing popularity and spread of cryptocurrencies around the world over the past few years, a recent study showed that most people still do not fully understand what this technology is and what its purpose is.\n\nChangpeng Zhao’s Binance exchange recently conducted a survey on social networks and tried to find out what people are most afraid of when it comes to crypto investing, and researchers have made several disturbing discoveries.\n\nFor example, about 30 percent of respondents indicated that the lack of adequate information about the work of cryptocurrencies is their main problem. By comparison, 42.8 percent of respondents said that unpredictability, uncertainty and market volatility were their fear.\n\n**Demystification of Crypto and Web3** \n\nThis educational series will cover five main topics that cause FUD for newcomers to cryptocurrency, including volatility, fraud, regulation and utility. This educational series will use the Halloween concept and will include a FAQ where ""Winny the Web3 Witch"" will answer all the confusing questions in the Web3 sector.\n\n**Binance wrote:**\n\n“Binance will be exploring a number of questions – bringing together independent research and information from a variety of sources to explain the real facts to counter a number of common myths. A common myth for example is that ‘crypto is used by mostly criminals.’ However, the facts are that crypto is now used by close to 300 million people worldwide.”\n\nIt should be noted that Binance has long been one of the most active players driving cryptocurrency adoption through awareness and education. The world\'s largest exchange has launched many global awareness campaigns and educational initiatives.\n\nIn 2018, Binance created the Binance Academy, which provides free education on blockchain topics, crypto assets, and general financial literacy in over 20 languages.\n\nIn June 2022, Binance Labs, the investment arm of Binance, raised a half-billion dollar fund in partnership with global investors including DST Global Partners and Breyer Capital to promote innovation in cryptocurrencies, Web3, and blockchain.\n\nBinance also partners with celebrities, athletes, and famous people to promote crypto products such as NFT, DeFi, and more. Specifically, the exchange has teamed up with football legend Cristiano Ronaldo to create an exclusive collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The newly minted NFTs were listed on the Binance platform, BinanceNFT, and sold out immediately.\n\nAt the moment, we are seeing that many countries still do not recognize cryptocurrencies, so Binance is collaborating with many countries to accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in their countries. Most recently, Binance partnered with the government of Nigeria to launch a digital economic zone to help fuel the growth of the blockchain sector in that country.\n\nBy helping to overcome the fears of many people associated with cryptocurrencies and blockchain, Binance confirms its high importance in the world of cryptocurrencies.', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/atbiekz29qw91.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5928f2308735cf3da01c2ca4c421a7bb98e96b48""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/atbiekz29qw91.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5928f2308735cf3da01c2ca4c421a7bb98e96b48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Binance Presents an Educational Series to Combat Crypto FUD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The world&amp;#39;s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, Binance, is releasing a new informational and educational series called &amp;quot;Exposing the Five Main Halloween crypto-Creepers&amp;quot;, dedicated to misinformation, myths, inaccuracies and FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt). in the crypto ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have all witnessed the growing popularity and spread of cryptocurrencies around the world over the past few years, a recent study showed that most people still do not fully understand what this technology is and what its purpose is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Changpeng Zhao’s Binance exchange recently conducted a survey on social networks and tried to find out what people are most afraid of when it comes to crypto investing, and researchers have made several disturbing discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, about 30 percent of respondents indicated that the lack of adequate information about the work of cryptocurrencies is their main problem.

cryptocurrencies around the world over the past few years, a recent study showed that most people still do not fully understand what this technology is and what its purpose is.\n\nChangpeng Zhao’s Binance exchange recently conducted a survey on social networks and tried to find out what people are most afraid of when it comes to crypto investing, and researchers have made several disturbing discoveries.\n\nFor example, about 30 percent of respondents indicated that the lack of adequate information about the work of cryptocurrencies is their main problem. By comparison, 42.8 percent of respondents said that unpredictability, uncertainty and market volatility were their fear.\n\n**Demystification of Crypto and Web3** \n\nThis educational series will cover five main topics that cause FUD for newcomers to cryptocurrency, including volatility, fraud, regulation and utility. This educational series will use the Halloween concept and will include a FAQ where ""Winny the Web3 Witch"" will answer all the confusing questions in the Web3 sector.\n\n**Binance wrote:**\n\n“Binance will be exploring a number of questions – bringing together independent research and information from a variety of sources to explain the real facts to counter a number of common myths.

2. How to correctly model users behaviors when deciding transaction fees?
3. Are we aiming to increase miner's revenue from transactions or to cap it? Where is the right balance?

# Why should you care about decentralized identity?

A big part of our modern life happens online. As a consequence, you need an identity to represent you in the virtual world. When we talk about identity, particularly online identity, what we think of is stuff like username, avatar, number of followers, content that you share online, or anything that separates you from others. Such information is essentially entries stored in the databases of Meta, Google, and Twitter. 

And here is the thing: you don’t own it. Meta, Google, and Twitter do. 

Now, most people already know that fact, but what’s so wrong with not owning your data? After all, we need tools to function our daily lives, and those platforms still work okay (most of the time) for us. What to complain about? 

Probably nothing, except for when we are banned from accessing the service (if you have ever been suspended on Reddit, welcome on board!), when their algorithms change in less favor of our benefits, or when the platforms shut down (you think Facebook will last your entire lifetime?). 

I know, I’m being extreme. Most of us are just regular users. We comply with the rules, we are not bots, and we don’t do anything that violates the policy. But it is also the fact that we are just regular users that make us feel powerless when we don’t own our data. Most of the time, we are compliant users, but once in a while, we may do unintentional things that could accidentally make those platforms think we are harmful. And since you are a regular user, it is extremely difficult to deal with the platform. It is the risk of accidentally getting harmed by the platform that makes owning your data a problem.

That’s just the first unpleasant thing about not owning data. Of course, it is just a possibility, but the next unpleasant thing is not a probability, it is a sure thing: those platforms (and the third parties) will use your data to fuel their services. We have to consent to give away our data although we actually don’t want to! 

Next comes the security problem. Those user databases are so valuable that they have become honeypots for hackers. At this point, I truly believe that my data has been leaked somewhere, just not sure where. Remember the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal? Million of users have their data leaked and the hacked data is used to send political advertising to the users. 

That’s not all. The database is not only centralized but it is also siloed by each network. Facebook has a version of you, Twitter has another, and Instagram has another. While it’s cool that I have a different self on each of the platforms, I am tired of rebuilding my profile and my reputation again and again. And if those platforms shut down or I get banned, I will lose all the things I have on that platform. (Actually, I can download my data on Facebook, but what can I do with it? Import such data onto Twitter? Elon, can we do that yet?)

Alright, enough for ranting. Time for a solution. 

# Enter Decentralized Identity

What can we do to solve these problems? Decentralized identity might be a good answer. 

So what is decentralized identity? Let’s have a high-level understanding of decentralized identity before we dive into the working mechanism of decentralized identity under the hood. 

The key difference between web2 identity and web3 identity is centered around two things: identity ownership and portability (another word is interoperability). 

Identity ownership is the most important trait of decentralized identity. The word decentralized implies that the ownership is dispersed from the centralized identities and is restored to users’ hands. 

The second interesting trait of decentralized identity is portability, which means you can use your identity to access different platforms seamlessly. 

Now, let’s get under the hood of how Decentralized Identifiers (DID) works. 

Currently, the most accepted standard for DID is made by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). As per the standard of W3C, a DID is a URI (similar to a URL) that can resolve to (i.e., look up to) a DID document. Let’s pause a little and look closely at each element. 

\- URI: URI is pretty similar to URL. It is used to identify a logical or physical resource on the internet. 

\- DID document is a document that contains information associated with the subject that DID refer to (DID subject). 

\- DID document is stored on a verifiable data registry, which can be a blockchain or decentralized storage (eg., Ceramic Network)

\- The last component in the DID infrastructure is DID controller, which controls (changes or updates) DID. DID controller can sometimes be DID subject. 

Below is the graph that shows the infrastructure of DID (source: W3C)

&amp;#x200B;

Another decentralized identity standard is Verifiable Credentials. While DID represents your identity, VCs represent your achievements, certificates, and participation. For example, a VC can be a badge that helps a member of a DAO prove their contribution to the community and thus, receive more voting power. 

Besides using DID and VC to create decentralized identity, another way to create decentralized identity is to wrap the identity in a token, such as an NFT or a Soulbound Token. This token will contain the data that make up its owner’s identity. Since user owns this token, they can use it to access any platform across web3 (portability). 

# Top projects in decentralized identity

Enough for theory. Let’s explore the top projects working on making decentralized identity a reality. 

**1/  Disco (**[**disco.xyz/**](https://disco.xyz/)**)**

Although still in the beta phase, Disco has attracted a lot of attention. It helps users create their identity in web3 and they can take this identity with them to access any apps and spaces in the ecosystem, all in one “backpack”.

Currently, Disco stores user data on Ceramic Network, a decentralized storage, but will integrate more storage solutions over time. 

Recently, Disco integrated with Guild to allow gated access and customized roles using VCs.

**2/ Spruce (**[**spruceid.com/**](https://www.spruceid.com/)**)**

Spruce is building infrastructure for decentralized identity. Its DIDKit helps developers build DIDs and VCs functionality for their projects across platforms. 

Spruce also offers Kepler, a decentralized storage, which is an important component of DID system. 

The company is funded by Y Combinator and a16z. 

**3/ Lens Protocol (**[**lens.xyz/**](https://lens.xyz/)**)**

Lens Protocol is a decentralized social network. At the core, Lens Protocol has two components: 

Profile NFT

Projects build on top of Lens

The Profile NFT is the main object in the Lens Protocol. Think of this NFT as your portable profile. The special thing about this NFT is the ability to post publications (content) to it. It also contains all the posts, comments, and other content that you generate.

Since you own this NFT, you also own all of the data and content that you generate on the platform (aka social graph) and bring it to new platforms. 

What’s more, Lens allows builders to create platforms on top of it, creating a rich and vibrant ecosystem. On Lens, users can upload their videos on Lenstube (a Web3 YouTube), update what is happening on Lenster (a Web3 Twitter), and many more in the future. 

**4/ Sismo (**[**sismo.io/**](https://www.sismo.io/)**)**

Sismo helps users claim badges in the form of a soulbound token (SBT). For example, a badge can be ""Donated to Gitcoin grants"" or ""Voted 2 times in the ENS DAO"". These badges can help users gain access to gated services or prove their reputation within a community.

Of course, it is just a possibility, but the next unpleasant thing is not a probability, it is a sure thing: those platforms (and the third parties) will use your data to fuel their services. We have to consent to give away our data although we actually don’t want to! 

Next comes the security problem. Those user databases are so valuable that they have become honeypots for hackers. At this point, I truly believe that my data has been leaked somewhere, just not sure where. Remember the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal? Million of users have their data leaked and the hacked data is used to send political advertising to the users. 

That’s not all. The database is not only centralized but it is also siloed by each network. Facebook has a version of you, Twitter has another, and Instagram has another. While it’s cool that I have a different self on each of the platforms, I am tired of rebuilding my profile and my reputation again and again. And if those platforms shut down or I get banned, I will lose all the things I have on that platform. (Actually, I can download my data on Facebook, but what can I do with it? Import such data onto Twitter? Elon, can we do that yet?)

Alright, enough for ranting. Time for a solution. 

# Enter Decentralized Identity

What can we do to solve these problems? Decentralized identity might be a good answer. 

So what is decentralized identity? Let’s have a high-level understanding of decentralized identity before we dive into the working mechanism of decentralized identity under the hood. 

The key difference between web2 identity and web3 identity is centered around two things: identity ownership and portability (another word is interoperability). 

Identity ownership is the most important trait of decentralized identity. The word decentralized implies that the ownership is dispersed from the centralized identities and is restored to users’ hands. 

The second interesting trait of decentralized identity is portability, which means you can use your identity to access different platforms seamlessly. 

Now, let’s get under the hood of how Decentralized Identifiers (DID) works. 

Currently, the most accepted standard for DID is made by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). As per the standard of W3C, a DID is a URI (similar to a URL) that can resolve to (i.e., look up to) a DID document. Let’s pause a little and look closely at each element. 

\- URI: URI is pretty similar to URL. It is used to identify a logical or physical resource on the internet. 

\- DID document is a document that contains information associated with the subject that DID refer to (DID subject). 

\- DID document is stored on a verifiable data registry, which can be a blockchain or decentralized storage (eg., Ceramic Network)

\- The last component in the DID infrastructure is DID controller, which controls (changes or updates) DID. DID controller can sometimes be DID subject. 

Below is the graph that shows the infrastructure of DID (source: W3C)

Another decentralized identity standard is Verifiable Credentials. While DID represents your identity, VCs represent your achievements, certificates, and participation. For example, a VC can be a badge that helps a member of a DAO prove their contribution to the community and thus, receive more voting power. 

Besides using DID and VC to create decentralized identity, another way to create decentralized identity is to wrap the identity in a token, such as an NFT or a Soulbound Token. This token will contain the data that make up its owner’s identity. Since user owns this token, they can use it to access any platform across web3 (portability). 

# Top projects in decentralized identity

Enough for theory. Let’s explore the top projects working on making decentralized identity a reality. 

**1/  Disco (**[**disco.xyz/**](https://disco.xyz/)**)**

Although still in the beta phase, Disco has attracted a lot of attention. It helps users create their identity in web3 and they can take this identity with them to access any apps and spaces in the ecosystem, all in one “backpack”.

Currently, Disco stores user data on Ceramic Network, a decentralized storage, but will integrate more storage solutions over time. 

Recently, Disco integrated with Guild to allow gated access and customized roles using VCs.

**2/ Spruce (**[**spruceid.com/**](https://www.spruceid.com/)**)**

Spruce is building infrastructure for decentralized identity. Its DIDKit helps developers build DIDs and VCs functionality for their projects across platforms. 

Spruce also offers Kepler, a decentralized storage, which is an important component of DID system. 

The company is funded by Y Combinator and a16z. 

**3/ Lens Protocol (**[**lens.xyz/**](https://lens.xyz/)**)**

Lens Protocol is a decentralized social network. At the core, Lens Protocol has two components: 

Profile NFT

Projects build on top of Lens

The Profile NFT is the main object in the Lens Protocol. Think of this NFT as your portable profile. The special thing about this NFT is the ability to post publications (content) to it. It also contains all the posts, comments, and other content that you generate.

Since you own this NFT, you also own all of the data and content that you generate on the platform (aka social graph) and bring it to new platforms. 

What’s more, Lens allows builders to create platforms on top of it, creating a rich and vibrant ecosystem. On Lens, users can upload their videos on Lenstube (a Web3 YouTube), update what is happening on Lenster (a Web3 Twitter), and many more in the future. 

**4/ Sismo (**[**sismo.io/**](https://www.sismo.io/)**)**

Sismo helps users claim badges in the form of a soulbound token (SBT). For example, a badge can be ""Donated to Gitcoin grants"" or ""Voted 2 times in the ENS DAO"". These badges can help users gain access to gated services or prove their reputation within a community.

decentralized identity a big part of our modern life happens online as a consequence you need an identity to represent you in the virtual world when we talk about identity particularly online identity what we think of is stuff like username avatar number of followers content that you share online or anything that separates you from others such information is essentially entries stored in the databases of meta google and twitter and here is the thing you don t own it meta google and twitter do now most people already know that fact but what s so wrong with not owning your data after all we need tools to function our daily lives and those platforms still work okay most of the time for us what to complain about probably nothing except for when we are banned from accessing the service if you have ever been suspended on reddit welcome on board when their algorithms change in less favor of our benefits or when the platforms shut down you think facebook will last your entire lifetime i know i m being extreme most of us are just regular users we comply with the rules we are not bots and we don t do anything that violates the policy but it is also the fact that we are just regular users that make us feel powerless when we don t own our data most of the time we are compliant users but once in a while we may do unintentional things that could accidentally make those platforms think we are harmful and since you are a regular user it is extremely difficult to deal with the platform it is the risk of accidentally getting harmed by the platform that makes owning your data a problem that s just the first unpleasant thing about not owning data of course it is just a possibility but the next unpleasant thing is not a probability it is a sure thing those platforms and the

- [Foundry](https://github.com/mattstam/solidity-template#foundry)
- [Hardhat](https://github.com/mattstam/solidity-template#hardhat)

Most contract repositories out there in the wild choose either one or the other. Both offer powerful tools for contract development, and although there is *some* overlap in their functionality, there is a multitude of reasons that you should be utilizing both:

- Complete test coverage using Forge to cover the raw contract logic and basic scenarios, and Hardhat the complex user interactions.

- Maximum suite of tools for contract debugging, deployment, gas measurements, etc.

- Reference for on-chain developers writing contracts that call these contracts in your [Unit Test files](https://github.com/mattstam/solidity-template/blob/master/contracts/test/) to see the expected usage in [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/).

- Reference for off-chain developers writing clients that call these contracts in your [Integration Test files](https://github.com/mattstam/solidity-template/blob/master/integration/) to see the expected usage in [JavaScript (TypeScript)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/).

The latter case has already proven to be extremely useful for a new project [Git Consensus](https://github.com/git-consensus/contracts), where just pushing integration test code gave examples for the frontend devs concurrently to know how they need to prepare input parameters for the contract functions. This will only be more relevant as the community shifts to [patterns](https://github.com/dragonfly-xyz/useful-solidity-patterns/tree/main/patterns/off-chain-storage) that encourage loaded input parameters for gas savings.

Of the repositories that *do* combine try to combine both Foundry and Hardhat, none are optimized together in a way that makes them convenient to develop in. This is due to the split between how Foundry handles dependencies (git submodules located in `/lib`) and Hardhat handles dependencies (managed with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)). Nothing felt up-to-date with contract development best practices in 2022.

This gap in a fully-featured, modern Solidity template that utilizes both frameworks inspired me to publish [solidity-template](https://github.com/mattstam/solidity-template) - not only is it optimized for using both, but it also offers a lot of the boilerplate a project will be able to utilize to streamline development: GitHub Actions, interactive CLI, linting, doc generation, deployment address tracking, contributor guides, etc.

opportunities with an inclusive project that generates founders and creators Quest based Staking\n\nThe XOA Ethos A totally unique Ai driven PFP project on Solana. Ai Art is the fastest growing “genre” of art on any blockchain, causing uproar, discussion and total fascination. XOA believes it has found the perfect story and process to wield this AI driven power.\n\nThe 4444 collection, our genesis, is the culmination of months of hard work from veteran CGI artist/designer [@timetoshine4948](https://twitter.com/timetoshine4948) Created using a combination of AI algorithms (Mid journey / stable diffusion / VOC) and in-house image manipulation software\n\nThe NFT market has a value of approximately $40 billion as of Jan 22, we see a significant value proposition suggesting that NFTs as assets will continue to growing over time. XOA’s key objective is to use it’s DAO to generate new art, new NFTs and new communities.\n\n“XOA” - The name of our project and the world in which the project resides. “High Council” - The DAO we will form with our holders. ""XOANs"" - Our community members and those that join our project\n\nThe XOA NFT We are looking to bring in as many unique holders as possible to grow value organically and spread the vision as wide as feasibly possible. The XOA genesis mint aims to provide a collection of work that is totally unique.\n\nTribes will be used as a variety tool for the collection without leaning on trait-based rarity Trait-based rarity is a tiered feature of the NFT universe. Seeing a strong decline in relevance, XOA aims to use simple trait systems. But one that will evolve over time\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/goeebt9vzjw91.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fea9b73ddbd8204509e74f1897c2d453b28d62a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ut8rru9vzjw91.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cd398ce1b50f8b959339c96ecb656de9af37e8b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3pdpr3avzjw91.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96dbd46e4e4bad19e2aa6c6dea6673eb4133855e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jtuvl4avzjw91.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb198efcdea59bebb246c345e59ce2a794219ac2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8f87hy9vzjw91.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e06273578242c3e61657e45b64939f0a0f978e68', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://reddit.com/link/yfpfxo/video/u9inl6xrzjw91/player""&gt;https://reddit.com/link/yfpfxo/video/u9inl6xrzjw91/player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The XOA Universe Collection: 4444&lt;/strong&gt; An Infinite Universe of artistic possibilities Empowering artists and creating opportunities with an inclusive project that generates founders and creators Quest based Staking&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The XOA Ethos A totally unique Ai driven PFP project on Solana.

XOA’s key objective is to use it’s DAO to generate new art, new NFTs and new communities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“XOA” - The name of our project and the world in which the project resides. “High Council” - The DAO we will form with our holders. &amp;quot;XOANs&amp;quot; - Our community members and those that join our project&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The XOA NFT We are looking to bring in as many unique holders as possible to grow value organically and spread the vision as wide as feasibly possible. The XOA genesis mint aims to provide a collection of work that is totally unique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tribes will be used as a variety tool for the collection without leaning on trait-based rarity Trait-based rarity is a tiered feature of the NFT universe. Seeing a strong decline in relevance, XOA aims to use simple trait systems. But one that will evolve over time&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/goeebt9vzjw91.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4fea9b73ddbd8204509e74f1897c2d453b28d62a""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/goeebt9vzjw91.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4fea9b73ddbd8204509e74f1897c2d453b28d62a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/ut8rru9vzjw91.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3cd398ce1b50f8b959339c96ecb656de9af37e8b""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ut8rru9vzjw91.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3cd398ce1b50f8b959339c96ecb656de9af37e8b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/3pdpr3avzjw91.png?width=2000&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=96dbd46e4e4bad19e2aa6c6dea6673eb4133855e""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/3pdpr3avzjw91.png?width=2000&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=96dbd46e4e4bad19e2aa6c6dea6673eb4133855e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/jtuvl4avzjw91.png?width=2000&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fb198efcdea59bebb246c345e59ce2a794219ac2""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/jtuvl4avzjw91.png?width=2000&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fb198efcdea59bebb246c345e59ce2a794219ac2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/8f87hy9vzjw91.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e06273578242c3e61657e45b64939f0a0f978e68""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/8f87hy9vzjw91.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e06273578242c3e61657e45b64939f0a0f978e68&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'XOANFT', 'subreddit_id': 't5_7a4xpd', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/XOANFT', 'subreddit_subscribers': 1, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/haoUCrDHPR-vySiA0ROrYP_MxV03GpLrTqfQo_hvspY.jpg', 'thumbnail_height': 48, 'thumbnail_width': 48, 'title': 'The XOA Universe Collection: 4444', 'top_awarded_type': None, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'treatment_tags': [], 'ups': 1, 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/XOANFT/comments/yfpfxo/the_xoa_universe_collection_4444/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': None, 'wls': None}]"		dfc58e32-1f91-11ec-8773-d2282d993a02	"The XOA Universe Collection: 4444
