Conservatives are less hostile to bitcoin because some republican politicians are being open about it. The moment Trump or Tom Cotton tells them to be hostile towards it, they will be. Bill Barr, Mnunchin, and Trump and the entire Neocon establishment are and were hostile to bitcoin.

They do not believe in the right to censorship resistence, confiscation resistence, and radical financial sovereignty and self custody, they want backdoors, and they want to violate your freedom of assembly, property, and speech, they are becoming radicalized and anti-liberal in the process.

**Background:** 

**Max Keiser** is a controversial Bitcoin supporter who is very positive about Bitcoin but doesn’t hesitate to push lies, propaganda and his own agenda. He’s even worse compared to Michael Saylor because he’s looking like a maniac. Keiser is employed by Russia Today, a Kremlin paid propaganda channel and Keiser was already called out for crisis profiteering at expense of El Salvadorian people but he denied it. He’s an embarrassment to Bitcoin because he’s only caring for his own profit. 

Recently, Keiser has pushed his position as an apologist of Bukele’s power grab in El Salvador, where Bukele has started to deconstruct democratic institutions: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-polarity-of-bitcoin-in-el-salvador

**Alex Gladstein** is a human rights activist from Human Rights Foundation (HRF), where he supports Bitcoin from a human rights perspective. He has funded many Bitcoin projects in Africa and written many articles for Bitcoin Magazine, where Bitcoin can promote human rights. 

Gladstein believes in Bitcoin and a more decentralized world, where people can use Bitcoin to overcome dictatorships, oppression and high inflation. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, Keiser and Gladstein are very opposed because Gladstein is pro democracy and anti authoritarianism while Max Keiser can be seen as an apologist of Bukele’s dismantling of democratic institutions. 

Bitcoin is used as a battleground where each party tries to score points. It started, when Max Keiser praised Bukele and accused Gladstein for a lack of knowledge of Bitcoin, a very harsh accusation. Alex Gladstein replied friendly but outlined clearly, that Max Kaiser has crossed a line: 

https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1492930040878833665?cxt=HHwWgoC9kcv9-bcpAAAA

It hasn’t stopped and a few days later Max Keiser started to attack Alex Gladstein again, where Alex Gladstein fired back and outlined Max Kaisers support for anti democracy advocates: 

https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1494339470551699467?cxt=HHwWlsCiwZj1-rwpAAAA

Gladstein gets humiliated now very frequently by Max Keiser because Gladstein is simply using his right of free speech for criticism. It’s a common pattern for Max Keiser to side with everyone as long as it’s a Bitcoin supporter, no matter how authoritarian. We don’t need people like Max Keiser openly supporting authoritarian power grabs and Gladstein presents a refreshing reminder why it’s important.

I saw the boxes for sale online and other stuff that looks kinda like a car muffler on [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com), I'm not sure what is legit or just a waste of money.  Thanks in advance!

Last Friday, on February 11, 2022, The Honkhonk Hodl fundraiser raised their goal of 21 BTC, approx. 1.1 mil CAD. On Friday u/HonkHonkHodl and u/tallycoinapp (the donation platform), on Twitter were promoting reaching their goal, asking for more donations and cooperating with other bitcoin twitter accounts.

On February 8th, 4 days earlier, the donation wallet started to transfer the funds into 12 other wallets. The total transferred was 13.18 BTC or $681,017 CAD.

A Retweet by u/HonkHonkHodl from Friday, Feb 11th, had bolstered about someone donating 5 BTC ""to the cause of freedom"". A complete 5 BTC transfer out was transferred out the same day, along with 3 other transfers. The total transferred was 6.78 BTC or $350,629.

By Monday, Feb 14, the donation wallet had received more foundations and made their 17th transfer out. Out of the 17 wallets where the funds were now held. 10 of the transfers were also moved to new wallets.

The fundraisers behind HonkHonkHodl, have not released information on where the funds are going or that they have been moved.

Today, on Feb 17th, 8 of the 17 wallets seem to have completely washed their funds. Totalling 11.68 BTC or $603,471CAD.

4.53 BTC or $233,930 CAD has been transferred into other wallets.

4.42 BTC or $228,146 CAD has remained in the same wallets as they were initially moved to.

My goal was to test possible weaknesses in the BTC network by trying to generate private keys with transaction history. My initial thought was generate as many keys as possible. But this was not the best approach.  


My setup: a standalone pc running a BTC node with a local block explorer. Then my main PC running custom a python script that generates keys to search.  


My progress: At first I tried to generate completely random keys and generated about 1 billion before stopping and reevaluating. This took about a day. I used this as a base, I figured it wouldn't amount to anything and was correct. 

I decided to look more into the methods most people use to generate keys and go from there. (Not going into the exact method at this time.) But using this method, I would not start with a completely random private key, but a specific seed and go from there. I'm still in the super early stages and need to increase performance.  


I've been running the script for about 10 hours now and generated a total of 19,940 private keys and found 48 with a transaction history.  


Some stats about the wallets found:  
None with current balance.  
Most recently used was 2 months ago as of writing this.  
Highest balance history .1 BTC  


Current issue:

My current issue is when I first run the script it generates and pulls about 20 keys per second then slows down slowly to about 1 key per second after about 10 minutes. I need to try and figure out if this is an issue with the explorer that I can correct."

When I ask myself, what is the most effective way an individual/group of actor(s) can effect the crypto in a negative way and have the best odds of getting away with it. My mind travels to hijacking ownership of crypto assets or infrastructure; could be hacking wallets of firms, exchanges, etc. since most other methods require a concerted mass effort on the likes of a state run organization. Which is still possible…

However the problem with ownership is maintaining ownership and continuing malicious actions. In every example I can think of, it would not really be in a person’s best interest to maintain malicious ownership over infrastructure as others can just use different infrastructure. If you take someone’s crypto, it can be traced or laundered but you are always watching over your back and you have a trail, however I suppose this isn’t a problem for tyrannical states which cannot be held to account.

But if a person were to hijack a crypto exchange or gain access to a large amount of crypto illicitly from a large firm, and send it to an dead address which cannot be accessed, it is gone forever. If the person does this while being more than competent and managed to obfuscate themselves well enough, they could probably get away with this right?  

Is this a MAJOR exploit in security for end game crypto, I feel like over time this is bound to happen, which will forcefully limit supply, it would have massive irreversible impact too. However this would probably have major negative effect on the asset class as a whole would it not? I am curious if  this has ever crossed anyone else’s mind as being in realms of possibility?"

I am curious if  this has ever crossed anyone else’s mind as being in realms of possibility?"	will we ever see instances of hijacking large amounts of crypto for purpose of burning it or send it to inaccessible address i have always been wondering how to find exploits in systems and how a malicious actor can leverage it to their advantage when i ask myself what is the most effective way an individual group of actor s can effect the crypto in a negative way and have the best odds of getting away with it my mind travels to hijacking ownership of crypto assets or infrastructure could be hacking wallets of firms exchanges etc since most other methods require a concerted mass effort on the likes of a state run organization which is still possible however the problem with ownership is maintaining ownership and continuing malicious actions in every example i can think of it would not really be in a person s best interest to maintain malicious ownership over infrastructure as others can just use different infrastructure if you take someone s crypto it can be traced or laundered but you are always watching over your back and you have a trail however i suppose this isn t a problem for tyrannical states which cannot be held to account but if a person were to hijack a crypto exchange or gain access to a large amount of crypto illicitly from a large firm and send it to an dead address which cannot be accessed it is gone forever if the person does this while being more than competent and managed to obfuscate themselves well enough they could probably get away with this right is this a major exploit in security for end game crypto i feel like over time this is bound to happen which will forcefully limit supply it would have massive irreversible impact too however this would probably have major negative effect on the asset class as a whole would it not i am curious if this has ever crossed anyone else s mind as being in realms of possibility 	0.0019288952462375164	0.9892198443412781	0.786504328250885	0.00723913824185729	0.007862231694161892	0.22946575284004211	0.08302589505910873	8.431997571278771e-07	0.44851154088974	0.0018732419703155756

Right now renewable energy sources have a problem, the rate in which they produce energy is sporadic often resulting in major gluts and inconsistent demand. Since the energy cannot be reliably stored, this results in what is called cycling, a plant having to shut down and restart production to suit the surrounding areas demand. Every time a power plant is turned off and on, the boiler, steam lines, turbine, and auxiliary components go through unavoidably large thermal and pressure stresses, which cause damage. This damage is made worse for high temperature components which will eventually start to fail, resulting in shorter component life expectancies which increase costs. If we want renewable energy sources to take market share from fossil fuels we need to find a way to reduce their prices to outcompete. 

Bitcoin fixes this?

This is where Bitcoin mining comes in. Bitcoin mining gives renewable energy companies reliable sources of income because Bitcoin mines can set up shop on site and act as buyers of last resort for the excess power generated and have virtually unlimited demand for excess meaning the plant won’t have to cycle or waste which is inefficient and costly. The reliable income from Bitcoin miners and virtually unlimited demand for excess gives power companies MORE money for expansion, R&amp;D , and most importantly lowers costs to the end consumer. 

The coming boon:

We have already seen this model working to great effect in Texas. Layer1, the largest US Bitcoin mine utilizing abundant wind energy buys excess power from the local renewable energy producers and mines Bitcoin, in times of high consumer demand in the surrounding areas the Bitcoin mine shuts or slows down, selling the energy it contractually purchased back to the grid acting like an insurance underwriter for producers. A harmony where both interests are met creating a huge boon in Texas renewable producers. Bitcoin miners are flocking to Texas allowing renewable producers to expand, making green energy more abundant. If you are a enterprising individual you would do well for yourself to find a way into this fledgeling market. 

Ultimately I predict Bitcoin will have the largest positive effect on renewable energy production, R+D and adoption in the coming decades. Bitcoin will do more for green energy in all forms than any industry, climate protest or politician combined utilizing game theoretic principles to achieve its ends. There are even more unique things happening in the Bitcoin mining world to look into, some Bitcoin mining companies are trapping flare gas that would’ve been exhausted into the atmosphere and using it to mine Bitcoin, for free.

I’ve owned Bitcoin since mid-2018 (a one-off purchase, that I’ve simply held ever since - I haven’t been able to afford to stack any more since then). I recently made my first ‘transaction’ by moving a small number of sats to a Muun wallet on my phone (as I want to try to actually spend a small amount, with the aim of a) testing out how a real world purchase using Bitcoin works; and b) doing my bit, albeit limited, to increase usage/knowledge among merchants). My question is - in the same way that physical dollar bills have unique reference numbers, does each individual sat that I own have a unique reference number of some sort? And, if I buy a meal (say) using my Muun wallet, do those specifically referenced sats now change hands, or is it just that my amorphous blob of Bitcoin decreases by x sats, and the merchant’s amorphous blob increases by x? As I said, can’t get my head around it - I’m not a tech guy, just fascinated by the concept of Bitcoin and it’s possibilities. Thanks!

You may feel that isn't so important but let's assume for the sake of my question it is, as I am mainly wondering about how this all actually works.

Do HD wallets resolve this dilemma? I don't understand how it would even be possible to trace an address that is only ever used a single time to an individual. That is, assuming other steps are taken to hide other identifiable information, such as hiding IP by using Tor etc, or some other means.

Basically, it seems that the only way to actually consistently tie random addresses to an individual is some sort of consistent, identifying information that isn't stored on the blockchain. This would be good. It is manageable.

But the part I'm not certain on is whether that would even matter if someone is able to tie a single address that you only use once back to you, if they can't then use that one instance to follow the rest of your transactions and, for instance, find out how much you hold in your primary cold wallet where you hold all your savings.

If you're using an HD wallet or just manually change address for next transaction, wouldn't it be impossible to continue tracing that?

Sure, they figured out one, but then they'd have to do it for the next one, and the next one, and the next one... so they're not establishing any sort of traceable ""link"" at all, just uncovering it on a case by case basis. Which without something really obvious like IP address of your device you clearly own, I don't see how it's possible to fo consistently.

Am I missing something here? Are specific bitcoins (or segments of them) individually identifiable so that you can actually follow the transaction history of a specific bitcoin?

So for instance, let's say I use an intermediary wallet on my phone to accept payments, and then I have my cold wallet on my pc to store all my money for safekeeping. If I were to move a small payment into my intermediary wallet, then to later move that same amount into my cold wallet, and every transaction used burner addresses only used a single time, you'd still be able to tell I was the owner of both of those wallets after enough transactions like that?

Or say that those payments I'm receiving on my phone wallet are regular payments from the same person. Despite random and single-use addresses for each transaction, it would still be possible to identify these regular transactions having come from the same person, to the same person, and not just random transactions that coincidentally are happening at similar intervals? Which could then be used in a cluster string to identify more personal info - not good for customer privacy.

I thought I would share it here for posterity

It’s a beautiful Monday morning. After waking up, you drive to your favorite local coffee shop and order a delicious iced black coffee and a chocolate croissant. You wait patiently while the masked barista prepares your coffee, checking your Twitter account to pass the time. Upon opening the app, you realize your account has been suspended.

“Oh, crap! Have I violated any rules?” you ask yourself in disbelief. You’ve heard stories of accounts disappearing into thin air, but after all, you’ve never considered yourself anything close to a ‘radical’. You’re a life-long Democrat! What’s the deal?

“Sir! Your coffee is ready!”

The barista knocks you out of your dazed disbelief, and you move to the front of the counter to pay.

“That’ll be eight dollars.”

You reach into your pocket, fish out your wallet, and insert your debit card into the reader.

Declined.

“Hm, that’s strange. I know I have enough money in my account. Let me try again.” People are waiting anxiously in line behind you.

Three exhausting attempts later, you accept defeat. You make a mental note to call your bank and scrounge for that emergency cash you keep crumpled in the back of your wallet.

The barista gives you your change, and you go about your day.

On your drive home, you remember that you retweeted a meme that was ‘edgier’ than you would like to admit. “Was this the reason for the ban? No, Twitter wouldn’t suspend my account just because I retweeted a meme. That would be ridiculous.”

But it wouldn’t be ridiculous. It would be real.

Your life has fallen apart in slow motion. Your bank accounts were all shut down. After hours on hold, customer support explains that you’ve been labeled a ‘terrorist’ and therefore cannot access your funds.

It’s easy to laugh this story off, but unfortunately, this dystopian fiction is slowly becoming a reality for some people. Dissidents and protestors across the globe are starting to realize that their ‘money’ is not their money. The government can censor their finances at will, crippling their lives and shutting down their ability to speak out.

We don’t need privacy until we desperately need privacy. People are often quick to say, “Oh, that’ll never happen to me. They wouldn’t censor me. I’m an excellent citizen.”

They fail to understand that if it can happen to them, it will happen to them. Unless, of course, they decided to opt out of the traditional financial system.

We now live in a world where governments can turn off your bank account because of your political views. But the once-hidden power of the central banking cartel is becoming glaringly obvious. Few considered the vulnerability of their finances until they saw the grotesque display of totalitarian intervention in the fundraising efforts of the Canadian Freedom Convoy.

After witnessing such blatant government overreach, censorship resistance is now at the forefront of global consciousness. We are at a tipping point.

A distributed ledger was not enough. A global cash-final settlement network was not enough. An inflation hedge wasn’t enough, either.

Will uncensorable money be enough? Will the masses only realize the true value of Bitcoin after their bank accounts have been shut down? Or will they see what happened in Canada and opt-out preemptively?

The greatest evils often birth the greatest advancements. Each fundraiser that the government bans is a massive billboard for censorship-resistant money. The tyranny is obvious; the question is, are the masses ready for Bitcoin? Or must we spill blood in exchange for freedom once again?

**TLDR**:

While inflation should theoretically reduce the value of a particular asset, in a strong bull market, enough demand can still outweigh the selling pressure from inflation.

You can clearly see this in the inflation chart (monthly) of Sushiswap. Despite the huge inflation in the early stages to incentivise users, the value of $SUSHI is increasing rapidly. This is something interesting in the crypto space.

# General Conclusion

Inflation is not only an important variable in monetary policy in the economy, but also important in crypto. Inflation is the easiest way to fund development. This forces holders to indirectly pay for development through the loss of value or ownership of the token over time to the protocol.

Inflation is usually referred to via a token release schedule; the researcher actively recalculates it.

# What Is Inflation?

&gt;Inflation in traditional economics refers to the **increase in prices of goods.** Inflation in token economics refers to the **increase in token supply.**

Inflation is the persistent increase in the general price level of goods and services over time and the value loss of a currency. When the general price level rises, **a unit of currency buys fewer goods and services than in the past.** Thus, inflation reflects a decrease in purchasing power per unit of a currency. In the economy, inflation is affected by many factors such as **demand-pull, cost-push, structural changes and import and export, etc.**

In the crypto space, inflation is the issuing of new crypto/tokens into circulation which puts selling pressure on them. In theory, their value should decrease with an increase in supply, if demand is constant. Inflation in the crypto space is mainly affected by **the increase in the supply of circulating tokens**.

# Token Issuance Model

The only impact on inflation is the issuance of tokens into circulation. Token inflation is used to bootstrap growth or to start a community. In this section we are going to find the answer to this question: which issuance models have been used so far in crypto space?

I consider them the &amp;quot;Blue Stack&amp;quot; a fascist merger of colluding government agencies, NGO, corporate press, and extreme tech conglomerates operating in sync to censor and depatform people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin cannot survive with one party, with only conservative parties, even if the average progressive is hardline opposed to the separation of the state and money, we must *CO-OPT and Control The Liberal Parties of the West* &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*We Must Co-opt and Control The Liberal Parties Of The West*&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*We Must Get anti-crypto Candidates Knocked Out of the Running, and Pro Bitcoin Pro Self-Custody Candidates Elected*&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cultural zeitgeist of western liberal parties is about as anti-cypherpunk as imaginable now, they will call anyone a Nazi, and do anything to censor you, they are on a clear trajectory towards extreme tyranny and abuses of the lack of constitutional restraint, we cannot let them continue forward in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'CryptoCurrency', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2wlj3', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/CryptoCurrency', 'subreddit_subscribers': 4496905, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'new', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'You May Not Like Politics In Bitcoin or Politics In General, You May Not Want To Do Politics, But Politics *Is Going TO DO YOU*', 'top_awarded_type': None, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'treatment_tags': [], 'ups': 2, 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/suxmi5/you_may_not_like_politics_in_bitcoin_or_politics/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}]"			"You May Not Like Politics In Bitcoin or Politics In General, You May Not Want To Do Politics, But Politics *Is Going TO DO YOU*

As a huge gamer and crypto novice I see a ton of potential for cryptocurrency to be used in games, either with NFTs or just crypto tokens fueling a game economy.

I have had trouble finding a good source of knowledge on what games are out there. I have found some, which I will list below, but figured this would be a good place for people to shill their favorite crypto games so we can give them a look!

Polker Games ( [Polker.game](https://polker.game/) ): [Polker.Game](https://polker.game/) is the first blockchain based, Free to Play &amp; Play to Earn, Poker NFT that uses Unreal Engine 4 for immersive and powerful gameplay while utilizing a provably fair system and TRNG technology.

[Polker.game](https://polker.game/) plans to launch on platforms such as iOS, Android, Windows, and streamings platform with intended support for next-gen VR, with stunning 3D characters, visual effects, and environments.

Cryptoroyale ([cryptoroyale.one](https://cryptoroyale.one/)) - Harmony ONE ecosystem

Faucet .io-type game where you control a little circle and doot around getting bigger or bouncing off your opponents draining their essence

My favorite due to its zero barrier to entry, simply go to the browser and start playing Community is great and active discord, devs care about feedback and are adding good updates regularly

Splinterlands ([splinterlands.com](https://splinterlands.com/)) - HIVE ecosystem

NFT trading card game

Large barrier to entry (not AXIE level large, but getting there) there are some free cards but to rank up you have to meet arbitrary ""power level"" requirements which can be quite expensive to reach

Some good design decisions which makes net-decking less powerful (randomized game modifiers)

I would love to get in on the ground floor of a good game developed with crypto as a feature rather than the main design element of the game. What games have all found that you like or think have good potential?"

I recently commented on a r/cc post about Solana and got dogged on by a few people for defending it's recent downtime in the context that it's a short term issue.

One person brought up a very valid point that piqued my interest and was hoping someone here could provide an explanation, so Solanas historical uptime can be seen here (https://status.solana.com/uptime).

The part that seems confusing is January's uptime was given  as 96.43%, which is bad but again in the context of what happened its not the end of the project, however if you actually add up (24hours*31days=744 hours total with 90~hours down=88%ish).

This is a bit off the reported figure and if anyone has an idea if this is a error in the site or just a different metric my back of a cig packet math doesn't calculate please comment below cheers."
