Do you know many poor with long term cash savings? From what I can see most live in credit card debt and their paycheques service that debt. 

For the small minority of poor that do save in cash I think a lot of it will be lack of knowledge of btc  and a valid fear of short term swings if they need access to the cash in the close future. People tend to also look to their peers, if most of them hold cash they will go the same way.

Just look at cars - they've reduced in value substantially over the years/decades, but the dollar has been devalued even more meaning that their price has actually gone up.

However, this is completely false. If you think about it, then who is actually the ones being impacted by inflation? Is it the people who own properties, stocks and other scarce assets, or is it people living day-to-day on their low salaries? 

Inflation is the increase of the money supply which ultimately leads to increasing prices. Now, those who own assets are benefitting from the price increase of their assets, while people who already struggle to buy groceries will just be struggling even harder. 

Distributing wealth is a very short term solution, and only helps those people the government decides needs help. Really what will fix the issue of the uneven wealth distribution is education and a money that cannot be manipulated by anyone.

Btc will reign supreme in this. You said all crypto, definitely not. And yeah it’s volatile at the moment, we know that. It’s still in its inception phase.

There’s nothing wrong with holding stocks but most of them are massively overpriced relative to earnings multiples. This has happened simply because govs print money , that cash needs to go somewhere and it flows into housing and stock markets inflating them way beyond their natural prices. If you know your stuff and DYOR and pick some undervalued companies sure go for it. I personally think that’s beyond most ppl and they shouldn’t have to learn about EBITDA, black sholes etc.

Fiat does that because of inflation. Inflation increases their wealth as they hold assets rather than cash which appreciate while wages always fall short in holding pace with inflation. Not only that but if you save money you get punished by inflation, so you are forced to invest which also incrases the value of their assets. And your investing will never be as sophisticated as theirs is with their acccess to top quality investment services.

Bitcoin rewards saving. You can just hold it. But if you don't add value and have an income in bitcoin eventually you have to spend it. So the rich will slowly grow less rich as they spend their bitcoin. While those who produce and earn will have more. Also the same amount of bitcoin will be worth more through time as the economy grows so those earning a little will be able to afford more in the future as the value of their savings increases. And them saving does not reward the rich and or put them at a disadvantage compared to the rich as saving is idiot simple.

We have turned things like housing into investments because people can’t hold cash which inflates away in power, people desperately seek something that holds purchasing power, be it stocks way outside their real prices or houses etc. Once they cotton on that with bitcoin they don’t loose that power wealth will be sucked out of those assets and they will become a lot cheaper (causing huge losses to landlords).

As well as making everything cheaper it will lead to the poor saving. At the moment if you don’t spend your money it’s worth less next year. Btc encourages saving as it’s worth more YoY.

And sure rich could buy up lots of btc with fiat as long as people are dumb enough to sell to them. However btc isn’t a yield earner, they won’t get rich just sitting on their asses, they will have to spend that btc to eat etc, they can’t just skim off the top.

It does lead to a deflationary environment where Capital holders will be extremely conservative where they invest. You won’t get btc thrown around like crazy due to zero rates etc. it will lead to only projects with real utility getting funded - and those that can make a real

He transferred tokens into Tornado Cash and then immediately withdrew them to a specific non-Tornado service, and then sent some *non-mixed* tokens from the same hack to that same service as well. It's hardly Tornado's fault that the person using it was an imbecile, this is a guy with an invisibility cloak who's still insisting on wearing his favourite hat.

Simple solution: Leave your funds in Tornado for a while and withdraw it piecemeal some time later. If you have unmixed tokens, don't send them to the same place as your mixed tokens. None of this is the fault of Tornado, if the hacker had done those things right he'd be untraceable. Monero would be vulnerable to an idiot using it too.

The second example has only one of those mistakes, once again the hacker sent some of his unmixed stolen tokens to the same address that he sent his mixed tokens to. Once again, this isn't Tornado failing, this is an idiot mistake on the part of the person *using* it.

Unless it was the hacker only pretending to be an idiot to throw the investigators off. They mention this possibility:

&gt; That said, considering how meticulous and careful the hacker has been, we should not discount the possibility that the hacker was trying to throw investigators down the wrong path. The transfer of 6.7604 Ether happened after the funds from Tornado Cash were sent into 0xC4C6E. Therefore, it might be plausible that this wallet does not belong to the hacker but instead to another user of Tornado Cash — the 6.7604 Ether transfer could have simply been a decoy.

Since you cannot track the tokens that are actually passing through Tornado Cash, the hacker can easily ""frame"" some other Tornado Cash user in this way. There's no way to tell.

The second example's authors note at several points that they *cannot* track funds through Tornado. 

&gt; Even though we are unable to confirm that these wallets belong to the hacker due to the nature of Tornado Cash, we believe it is still worth looking into due to various factors.

So neither of these examples show a case where Tornado itself has failed in its obfuscation.

First you have all the baggage. ETH is a fairly large blockchain that's a good thing for the most part, but with PoW, huge portions of that will be abandoned.

USDT and USDC are obvious examples of abandonment. Obviously you won't be able to redeem them for $1. But that has knock-on effects. defi with these pairings won't work.

In Ethereum Classic's case there actually was substantial demand, though, ""behind the scenes."" People were buying and selling it through direct transactions with each other. Eventually one of the major exchanges (Poloniex, IIRC) decided they wanted to get in on the transaction fees they could be making from those trades and they added ETC to their offerings. That led to a domino effect of other exchanges adding it too. At one point ETC peaked at around 20% the market cap of ETH.

Will there be a similar organic demand for ETHPoW? I consider it unlikely, personally. I suspect the only major players who want it to exist are the miners, and they only want to sell. You need buyers as well. A coin with sellers but no buyers is worthless.

So a ~10% increase in supply will have little impact on fees if demand is the same (or likely goes up)

Example: To move millions of tokens to cover a $30Mil dollar payment doesn’t make sense to me, too much information added to the ledger. I believe if chosen, a much higher token value to control ledger activities. 50% is currently in escrow. 

How much will be brought or bought back into Ripple or their clients? I think a majority of ISO tokens will have opportunity. It’s all a crap shoot, with 10,000 tokens, at a token price of $258 is a real potential within a few years of SEC settlement. 

With them looking at acquiring Celsius as example, I think this is a lot more happening than we may all realize, and then maybe nothing we don’t really know.

If 10K of XRP is 1%, it is still small, if it is 80%, way too much. As investors we need to be diversified and 5% is roughly the most XRP you should hold as a percentage of your entire crypto portfolio to be on the safe side in case XRP goes to shit. Meaning you should have a portfolio with BTC and ETH making up around 20% (many believe you should hold a lot more) and then about 16 alts at 5% each...if you must, go up to 10% on the alts if they are large cap with solid fundamentals. XRP is currently worth about $3700 for 10K so your portfolio should be around $75K in total to hold a good amount of XRP but it should be at least $37K or you are overextended IMO.

But you're right that the banks won't adopt it, at least not natively. They might at most interact with it via Solana Pay. My point is that dealing with banks is such a nightmare that I'd just rather avoid them entirely if Solana becomes a means of retail transaction at some point.

And the exact same statement is also true for Ethereum and probably most other smart contract L1s out there, because Defi protocols kind of naturally build on top of each other.

687	[]	False		Signal_Ad657			[]				text	t2_a2cvpuix	False	True	I removed your two posts, and explained the reasoning and gave solutions each time.  Your first post literally just said “can’t withdraw ships”.  And I asked that you provide more detail when making a post so people could better help you.  I also pointed out that we could help you REALLY fast if you hopped over to Discord.  You then created a new post calling Star Atlas a scam (like you are doing now) because you were having issues pulling your ships.  I took that down and again spoke with you.  Saying you can’t just make a post on our Reddit calling us a scam because you are having an issue navigating a site that 10,000 people use per day (my self included).  I once again offered for you to just hop over to Discord so we could help you.  You never responded (which has been the pattern) and then made another post calling Star Atlas a scam (which is now the pattern).  Everyone tried to help you and is still trying to help you.  I asked for clarity on your first post since there was no explanation of what you were experiencing and what you had tried so far, I asked that you be more respectful on your second post, and instead you chose to make a new post somewhere else calling the project a scam.  You weren’t banned, you weren’t muted, and any time your posts were corrected it was explained why.  There are several other posts from people troubleshooting ship withdraw and resource claim issues on our Reddit and none of them were removed because none of them decided to make a post calling us a scam.  You have -20 karma on Reddit, which seems to imply that most of what you say, people find objectionable.  I’d humbly ask you to consider the fact that maybe if places are taking your posts down it’s because of the way you write and the things you say.  Not because nobody wants to help you with a basic technical issue.  If you created a polite post on our Reddit saying “I have an issue, here’s what I’ve tried” it would still be there.  And I’ve told you that twice (now three times) at this point.	bf54b7151564d1675ea7fc672c69b52790756d27	True	False					0	1660208568		0	{}	iju2kpp	False	t3_wlagpf	False	True	t3_wlagpf	/r/solana/comments/wlagpf/star_atlas_scam_alert/iju2kpp/	1660208580	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]			i removed your two posts and explained the reasoning and gave solutions each time your first post literally just said can t withdraw ships and i asked that you provide more detail when making a post so people could better help you i also pointed out that we could help you really fast if you hopped over to discord you then created a new post calling star atlas a scam like you are doing now because you were having issues pulling your ships i took that down and again spoke with you saying you can t just make a post on our reddit calling us a scam because you are having an issue navigating a site that 10 000 people use per day my self included i once again offered for you to just hop over to discord so we could help you you never responded which has been the pattern and then made another post calling star atlas a scam which is now the pattern everyone tried to help you and is still trying to help you i asked for clarity on your first post since there was no explanation of what you were experiencing and what you had tried so far i asked that you be more respectful on your second post and instead you chose to make a new post somewhere else calling the project a scam you weren t banned you weren t muted and any time your posts were corrected it was explained why there are several other posts from people troubleshooting ship withdraw and resource claim issues on our reddit and none of them were removed because none of them decided to make a post calling us a scam you have 20 karma on reddit which seems to imply that most of what you say people find objectionable i d humbly ask you to consider the fact that maybe if places are taking your posts down it s because of the way you write and the things you say not because nobody wants to help you with a basic technical issue if you created a polite post on our reddit saying i have an issue here s what i ve tried it would still be there and i ve told you that twice now three times at this point 	0.0023006421979516745	0.9888207912445068	0.8958728909492493	0.011339860036969185	0.008303879760205746	0.7108789086341858	0.06507198512554169	8.447459549643099e-07	0.15126287937164307	0.01973271369934082

I also tried to engage some asset recovery places I found online but I'm 99.999% sure they're all scams. They all wanted money up front and some didn't even seem to know what a Solana wallet was. 

So be careful about these asset recovery places too. They prey on how stupid you feel and desperate you are in order to re-scam you.

The only legit company I could find was Crypto Cipher and they will only help you if you got scammed for a LOT of money. They said any outfit that will offer to try and get you a small amount of money back is trying to scam you.
