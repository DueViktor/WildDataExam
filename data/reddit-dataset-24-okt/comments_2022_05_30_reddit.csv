When banks ""reverse"" a wire, I don't believe they are actually reversing the payment, they are just reimbursing you at their own expense for their own mistake, then taking it up themselves to ask the receiving bank to voluntarily return the money.

You can either have a payment system that clears money instantly (FEDWIRE), or a payment system that takes 60 days to fully clear it, allowing for reversing fraud a long time after the fact (ACH). Both short-settlement and long-settlement payment systems have their place - society wouldn't be able to function efficiently with only one of them.

They don't actually send or receive the money every time we make a transaction - this would be too cumbersome. They make notes of credits and debits and change the numbers in their bank accounts. They send these lists of credits and debits through the automated clearing houses. This is like an L2 rollup. 

The federal reserve then takes the batches of credits and debits three times a day, and settles them by debiting and crediting actual money to different banks. 

I think Ethereum will eventually be a decentralized final settlement layer, where different protocols and chains meet to settle their debts.

These things are niche today, but they're just a subset of what's possible with turing complete smart contracts (which is pretty much infinitely many things). If you can imagine it, you can code it. Including non-financial use-cases which will continue emerging as computation capacity scales.

To me it's pretty cool that you can have truly open-sources apps where the back-end always runs the same code as-is that you can audit yourself. Sure, the average joe doesn't give a shit about that, but it's not much different from how I can install Linux and reap the benefits of an open source OS without necessarily having to audit every line myself, because if something funky's going on then it's likely someone somewhere will have caught it. Compared to proprietary black box stuff where you're at the mercy of whatever central authority running code they claim to be running, collecting all the data they can on you, etc. But overall the fact that you *can* audit everything yourself is a good reason to trust it (that's pretty much what *weak subjectivity* is all about)

[],False,,domotheus,,,[],,,,text,t2_i5ghusfv,False,True,"&gt; buying $11 billion in ETH from the $226 billion market cap is not hard if you have the money

It's not ""$11 billion in ETH"", it's millions and millions of ETH. If there's 12M eth staked, you need to find and stake 12 million ETH of your own for 50%. Give it a few more years and we'll have 30M eth staked (with the often-discussed 1 million validators target), making nation states have to find 30M ETH somewhere, a pretty sizable % of the supply which simply isn't *that* liquid. Buying that much would drive the price way up and make it much more costly than just $11 billion. Imagine a world where ETH is $25k, suddenly we're talking about a trillion dollar price tag easily to get 30M ETH

They could conceivably seize all the ETH stored in exchanges but even that would raise massive flags when all exchanges under a specific country's jurisdiction become insolvent and literally can't let users withdraw, and even then a lot of ETH is constantly flowing out of exchanges and into DeFi where it can't be seized. 

And then they need to stake all that ETH and patiently wait nearly a year for all their validators to become active. Seeing the deposit queue clogged up for that long would surely raise more red flags that something is going on. It'd be easier to just seize custodian staking pools and get that money slashed instead (which would be a much needed wake up call for everyone who put their money there) but the following still applies:

They get to do a 51% attack *once* and lose their whole stake. It doesn't matter how sybil'd they were when building up those validators, the minute they do the attack, everyone can provably tell which validators participated in the attack and they all get slashed massively.

Suddenly there's 30 million less ETH in existence, if they wanna try again they need to find another 30M which is gonna be even harder now. With PoW if you spent all that time quietly building up enough ASICs (or seizing existing mining rig operations), you get to 51% attack as much as you want, since your mining rig can't be slashed by the protocol.

But yeah, the logistics in both cases are very complex and we definitely can't say for sure how it would go down. I for one welcome a government devaluing their currency by $1T and throwing it all into ETH, never to be sold

&gt;wouldn't have much confidence on the new chain anyway since it's lower value and the attack can just happen again much more easily

The millions of ETH that get slashed disappear from the supply, on all forks where validators are caught double-signing. Besides the money question, if there's 120M supply and you lose 30M per attack, you can't really do the attack more than 3 times, right. In the absolute worst case the 30M honest stakers keep their ETH and after the chaos settles down, the network is now *more* secure by having a higher % of supply staked.

&gt;or even save the fork by changing the hash function as soon as they notice something is happening 

Way easier said than done. Changing the hash function requires the same kind of social coordination you're saying would be near impossible with a fork under PoS, and the whole chain keeps getting spawncamped by our chaos-loving government during that time.

And then the fork comes and the hash function changes, which bricks all the honest ASICs too. If we're talking ASIC-resistant PoW, then the attacker's GPU mining rigs could also easily switch to whatever new algorithm was decided. The PoS equivalent of slashing would be to burn down only dishonest mining rigs the minute an attack is detected. Having the community decide on a fork to recover stuff would be the absolute last resort.",21d2efb550a76e17e96a6d5ac437fcf02f0ebda7,True,False,,,,,0,1653881591,,0,{},iai6vkb,True,t3_tijcq1,False,True,t1_iai2hjy,/r/ethereum/comments/tijcq1/stuff_rethereum_should_know_proof_of_stake_edition/iai6vkb/,1653881602,1,False,True,False,ethereum,t5_2zf9m,r/ethereum,public,,0,[],

Twenty years from now, consumers won't really be using any of it directly. Companies will use smart contracts, especially internationally, because it will be cheaper to hire programmers to formally verify a smart contract once and use it forever to enforce asset ownership, than to pay lawyers on an ongoing basis to enforce asset ownership through international legal contracts in ever-changing legal environments.

It's possible to write provably error-free smart contracts, it's just very expensive at the moment because the technological infrastructure is still being put in place to do it efficiently. But it's possible, and it will only get easier over the next decade or two. Formal verification is the same technique they use to mathematically prove that the code in space landers is free from bugs and other unintended behaviors.

There's a penalty system, but it's mostly very small penalties - for example, the amount you lose for missing an attestation (assuming the rest of the network didn't miss at the same time) is the same as the amount you gain for making an attestation. If you can keep your node running correctly 99% of the time, you should be making nearly as much as you would if it was running 100% of the time.

&gt;ETH is not gas. Otherwise, there wouldn't be a gas price constantly changing between ETH and gas. It's just that ETH is used to buy gas on the spot, whenever you need it.

&gt;There used to be a gas token, but it wasn't ETH and it doesn't even exist anymore.

Now what you claim I said about gas tokens:

&gt;You brought Gas tokens into the conversation in a way that read as if you thought they were used to pay gas, that's why people are questioning/disagreeing with you. It's not that we don't understand the concept, its that we don't understand YOU.

You read whatever you want on whatever is said by others. If you want to know what others have to say, you can ask instead of being condescending. But that's not what you did. You ask after having judged what you read was wrong and after having judged that what was said and believed by others was needing to be corrected.

So, arrogance seems to be yours, here. Clearly.

What happened is that I answered to someone who clearly confused ETH and gas. The two are very different. And I talked about a gas token because it's the logical conclusion to the confusion OC made: ETH is a token and is gas according to them, aka a gas token. It's not the case. 

But there used to be gas tokens. And, contrary to your claim that it was to reduce gas price, it wasn't at all the advantage of gas tokens. Rather, it was to *smoothen* the gas price, which the GAS token did quite well.

The mechanism was to ask for transactions at a time when gas price was low which allowed miners to benefit from transaction fees even when there was no one generally asking for transactions. And users would as a result receive these gas tokens, that they could sell afterwards at a higher price to have the ETH required to pay for their transactions even when gas price was higher.",e4d2670673a5443bf6eb274a381ab0bedaea9bef,True,False,,,,,0,1653898430,,0,{},iaiues7,False,t3_v0pqpd,False,True,t1_iaisakg,/r/ethereum/comments/v0pqpd/whats_the_end_game_of_eth/iaiues7/,1653898440,1,False,True,False,ethereum,t5_2zf9m,r/ethereum,public,,0,[],

If you're investing in crypto right now you don't understand the macro events that are taking place.

Crypto has never seen a recession since it was born out of the last one.

This is a risk off time. Liquidity in the stock market is shit right now which means even worse in crypto.

The irony here is  crypto was meant to set itself a part from the old system but we are. Still beholdin to it.

When the fed says its OK to Buy assets again, that's when it's OK.

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Does it have a possibility of rising in the near future ?

  
 Does it have a possibility of rising in the near future ?  
It depends on what you mean by near future.   
Next 18 months? Hard to say.   
Next 5 years? I'm long-term bullish on the ecosystem, so I'm going to say yes.    
  
Here are my thoughts on what the price will probably do:  
For some period of time - Could be 3 months, could be 30 months, we will stay in the range of $15 - $150. Some period of time after that we will enter a new range maybe something like $100-$1000.  
  
**Why:**

$15 is about a 95% drop from all-time highs.   
  
In the last cycle ETH dropped from $1200-$1400 down to \~$100,  just over 90%    
  
\~$40 is already an \~80%-90% drop from the ATH  (depending on where you place it)   
  
The problem is that I don't know for sure that we will get down to $20's and $10's. \~$40 might be the bottom and we may only see $40 for a short period of time. Tomorrow we could be up in the $60's and then hover in the $60 - $100 range for the next 12 months before the next major bull run.     
  
**Could we go to zero?**  
Yes, but I don't see it happening. The ecosystem fundamentals are strong, I would be very surprised if SOL doesn't make it through the next cycle.   
  
This guy has some good videos on SOL, he covers stats, upcoming code releases, etc.

If you aren’t up to speed about the following, please take an hour and watch the video I’ll post.

There isn’t a bunch of bears and bulls fighting on the retail battlefield. Market Makers move the chart. 

They stopped out a bunch of traders around the Summer Lows, turned buyers into sellers by wicking down to 25k and pulling off a clear out.
:::::::::::::::
Conceptual presentation of limit order liquidity and the impact of structural symmetry / consolidation on it. As time passes and if the price cannot break dense highs or lows, chances are the liquidity around those price levels will increase with time. The more time it passes, the more the liquidity will increase (if major highs/lows do not break), the more juice for MM (market maker) to push for clearout liquidation.
