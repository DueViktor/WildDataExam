I’d say: set an amount that you feel comfortable you’ll never miss not having it, and it won’t put your bank balance in danger of being overdrawn. That way you can truly “forget it”.  Keep in mind as well that you can change the amount at any time, or pause it if you get low on fiat funds sometime.

Also, I feel like Weekly DCA is a nice sweet spot for getting the most of price fluctuations…but you can weigh that against your paycheck schedule, expense schedule and such.

The price is being held up on the back of those who don't think about Bitcoin's value in fiat prices. Bitcoin is a hedge against monetary debasement and that is what you are see happen around the world as we speak. Manipulation in the Bitcoin price is very real due to it having a very small market cap compared to the asset classes it will eventually consume. But as the world continues to lose faith and trust in nation-state fiat due to inflation and debasement, more energy will flow into bitcoin as a protection and preservation of wealth as Bitcoin's Layer 1 properties are set in stone. My advice to you anon is to zoom way out and learn more about economics and the monetary history of the world. If you read the top 10 best selling Bitcoin books, you'd have a much better grasp of what you are seeing and you won't be phased by it. Start with 'The Bitcoin Standard'. Bitcoin is **not** a novel tech....fact the opposite is true. The world has a long history of empires eroding due to greed and corruption of money - which is the unit that represents the expenditure of our time and our bodies and it is only now **because** of technology that we can create a truly decentralized, immutable, work-based, stateless version of money that can't be confiscated or debased.

What an investor tries to do is not buy everything at the bottom but to find undervalued investments and THEN start buying it.  Note I said undervalued and NOT the bottom, there is a difference.

Once an opportunity is below a price point you slowly start buying into that position.  The farther the asset drops the faster or larger the purchases.

As for Bitcoin take a look at this chart and set it for 1 year: [https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/)

You can tell a bottom when there is what is called ""capitulation"".  Meaning, in short, panic selling.  When you look at that chart do you see anything that even remotely looks like ""panic selling""?

No it is all gradual and controlled so far.  Meaning it is not even close to a bottom.

My concerns are mainly about its decentralization, why people say it's some currency when it has not yet become a medium of exchange. Store of value ? I think it depends on people's definition of store of value.  
  
What do Bitcoin's transactions aim to ? why would people or business make transactions on Bitcoin's network (maybe on Lightning Network).  
  
Bitcoin is somewhat centralised ? (few miners having the possibility to control more than 51% of the network) and even in the future what will happen when the computing power necessary to mine bitcoins increases, only few and powerful miners will coexist, thus eliminating small miners.
