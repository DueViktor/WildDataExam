The jist is. People see the development of the ethereum protocol as in the hands of a few developers who have unilateral decision making. That being vitalik and a small group of other core Devs. Bitcoin had satoshi who just up and left and left it up to random devs who do not push changes on the community, nodes tend to make the final decision on if the protocol is upgraded. Where as on the other hand Ethereum kind of push users to update (which is why ethereum updates frequently and at decent ish speed compared to bitcoin which took 4 years to update significantly (segwit 2017 taproot 2021)) 

This is obviously debatable but I can kind of understand the point as you can see examples in the wild of Ethereum's more centralised control. An example being the DOA hack where vitalik proposed a fork, loads of people were pissed and disagreed but it went ahead anyway (kind violating the intention of a blockchain which is to be immutable and uninfluenced by one or a small group of people, which in this case Ethereum was) 

Another argument IV seen is alot of Ethereum's development is largely founded by ethereum alliance and consensys. Consensys being a company that can influence ethereum in a huge way. (Side note IV worked with Consensys they are super helpful and have some real cool tech)

For sure it's open source so anyone can contribute or attempt to contribute. I think people's beef is that the final decisions to upgrade and what gets implemented tend to come from a group of people rather than whole community participating in the network.

The tokenomics of ethereum have changed, they even changed super recently with the London upgrade. They went from predictable inflation to burning tokens to curb inflation or even potentially make it deflationary. On top of that they changed the way miners are payed and added base fees. That is a massive change from its initial tokenomics. (Again don't get angry at me I'm not saying this is a bad thing, simply pointing out the facts and arguments of others). Also Bitcoin has never cared about the price in dollers, it wasn't made to make people fiat rich it was made as an alternative Monterey system that anyone is free to participate in. It's long term security plan is that it will be used along side feiat as a medium of exchange (not be an investment, it was not created initially as an investment verichal)

So in practice, Bitcoin's issuance contributes to the majority of the network's security, while the transaction fees contribute a negligible amount of security.

Because the Bitcoin issuance schedule halves every 4 years infinitely, that means that unless the Bitcoin price doubles every 4 years infinitely (which is obviously impossible), Bitcoin will hit an inflection point where the network security begins to decline.

As network security continues to decline every 4 years, eventually it will hit a point where Bitcoin can be 51% attacked.

The only solutions are 1, for Bitcoin to remove the 21M bitcoin cap (fat chance) or for Bitcoin to move off of Proof Of Work to a different consensus model (also fat chance).

In contrast, Ethereum has no hard cap and constantly issues new Ether for proof of stake. Though in practice, it very well may be the case that in practice Ethereum is long-term deflationary, because the Ether burn from EIP-1559 is projected to outpace the issuance.

The result of this is that Bitcoin as we know it, with its Proof Of Work and 21M bitcoin cap, will implode and cease to exist at some point within the next several decades.

As for the 51% attacks again that is entirely speculative assumption that the network consolidates and even if so https://youtu.be/ncPyMUfNyVM

Personally, I see it as just the same. 

In a sense, yes, it's different. One sends a message to a smart contract, calling a function of such smart contract, while the other sends a message to a wallet that isn't a smart contract. 

But beyond the fact it's a smart contract and that you call a function of it, there's no difference. Both just send a message to a wallet. It depends on how you want to see things. 

Yes, as weird as it can seem, we're always talking about currencies, but it's all just a giant, decentralized messaging system storing copies of the same (well, nearly the same, if we take into account communication delays and different temporarily competing chains) global bookkeeping of such messages on every nodes. 

&gt;Why is ERC20 a global contract but ERC721 NFTs are individual contracts for each NFT?

It's a bit more complicated than that. ERC-721, like ERC-20, is a standard, an interface of smart contract. It allows you to interact with the tokens it manages. 

Each NFT of a smart contract implementing ERC-721 is unique (due to its tokenId), but there can be several NFTs for any given ERC-721 smart contract. Generally, such smart contracts having several NFTs are called a collection. 

For instance, one of the most known, Bored Ape Club, has something like 10k NFTs in its smart contract. So, there can be more than one per smart contract. 

Rather than having one individual contract for each NFT, it's more like one individual contract for each collection of NFTs. 

In a sense, a parallel could be made with fungible tokens of ERC-20, where each ERC-20 smart contract handles some sort of ""collection"" of fungible tokens.",,,,1647219939,{},i0k8rbx,False,t3_tcjieh,False,False,t1_i0k0ssw,/r/ethereum/comments/tcjieh/ethereum_is_on_course_to_become_deflationary/i0k8rbx/,1665052341.0,1,True,False,ethereum,t5_2zf9m,,0,[],,[],text,t2_13pqgo,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are other ways to invest in a business than through an IPO, you know. You can actually invest in busiensses that don't even sell stock!

&gt; The ""money"" i.e. ""ETH"" in this scenario has no value if it is not spent, so this point is somewhat moot. ETH can accrue in value relative to USD as much as it wants, eventually it will be spent and you achieve your money multiplier.

If people sit on ETH for five years at a time before using it and sit on USD for... *checks notes*... literally never because they have it direct deposited into the bank, and banks lend out money right up towards the reserve rate at what's pretty much a continuous rate.

&gt; However, wealth generation through investment doesn't really exist. A lot of wealth generation by banks, hedge funds, investment firms, Wall Street etc. Doesn't actually generate economic activity. Most of what these firms do is move money around for the purpose of making as much money as possible for themselves at the detriment of everyone else (GFC 2008).

Hang on, they try to make money for their investors by, among other things, investing in things that they think will be productive uses of money (which is good, investing smarter, you said it was good when you were trying to pretend it was a function of deflation, remember?), investing on behalf of their investment customers (I'm not going to pick my own investments, I'll trust betterment, they're greedy but they work for me), lending to people and businesses who think they will be able to pay off their loans (similar to investment), providing banking services (pretty scummy, people are probably better served by credit unions, but it beats the alternative, which is nothing because crypto does not provide banking services no matter how many people use that analogy)...

Then, the problem with 2008 is not that banks were greedy, it's that banks were greedy and defrauding one another and the rating agencies participated in the fraud, and people there blinded themselves to the risks they were facing. Banks are operated by humans. That doesn't mean they don't serve an economic purpose. Lending still generates economic activity -- whether it provides liquidity or helps people buy homes (again, it's better if they can afford those homes, but it's economic activity either way) -- and so does investment, and so does employing people to work at your bank, and so do credit cards (again, plenty of problems, but they encourage transactions)...

&gt; There are already many incentives to spend ETH. One can even make their staked ETH liquid and take out a loan against it for the purpose of spending.

That ""all smart contracts"" question seems to assume there's some kind of centralized decision process about all smart contract development. It's not the case, anyone can implement any smart contract they want. 

When I think about it, I may be wrong, but it seems that your actual question is something along of ""what are the advantages of using WETH instead of ETH that pushes some businesses to have chosen WETH in their smart contracts dealing in NFT markets?""

Well, if that's what you were wondering, it's an interesting question. 

In short, it's for compatibility purposes and for easier interoperability between chains. 

The question goes way beyond just Ethereum itself, as a network, because NFTs are a huge market that goes way beyond that network: side-chains and other chains also deal with NFTs. Yet, to interact with other markets, it is way easier with ERC-20 tokens, because then you can have smart contracts being used as bridges to allow for easy ""transfer"" of such tokens (technically, it doesn't work as a transfer, but it's the feature it provides, just like when WETH stores ETH to mint WETH or the other way around when releasing ETH). 

And having an ERC-20 token as WETH ensures you can use all the functions of ERC-20 tokens. 

In short, a benefit for a cost. Even more so given that the cost is negligible when compared to NFTs that need to be minted.

[],,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,,,,"You do get something from the SOL side.  If you don't, then the defi system you are using is doing a poor job.  The defi system takes your SOL and then has a choice:

a. Use that SOL to somehow earn ""better than staking rewards"" returns (lending, or something, I dunno)

b. If there is no way to do better than staking, then stake it

The only caveat is that it can't do this with *all* the SOL because it must still have a reasonable amount of loose SOL on hand to supply the expected liquidity (it can keep less on hand but then it will need some way to acquire SOL on demand which might be expensive).

So minus some fraction kept around for liquidity, it is using that SOL to make *at least* staking returns.

If the defi system is efficient (in competition with other investment vehicles and thus having to pay out better-than-competitors returns) then it will pass most of  what it earns to the end user.  Which means, that the earnings that it makes off  of your SOL - either through staking or something else - is mostly paid back to the user.

And thus the user enjoys APY that is almost the same as staking with that SOL, and there is a good chance that much of that SOL in fact **is** being staked behind the scenes.

There is simply no reasonable alternative.  The defi system that you deposit your SOL into is going to find some way to maximize earnings off of it.  That means **at a minimum** making staking rewards, and possibly making more if they can find a way to do better than staking rewards.

So in the end, on the SOL half of the pool tokens, the end user receives returns commensurate with what the would have gotten had they stated it themselves (and possibly better if the defi system can somehow make more with that SOL than the user would have).",,,,1647228246,{},i0kpg1f,False,t3_tdcvps,False,True,t1_i0j30yu,/r/solana/comments/tdcvps/staking_on_marinade_finance/i0kpg1f/,,1,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,,0,[],,[],text,t2_cqgpowc,False,False,False,37d0e118076fa273a96dfad5d260875c982f821f,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1647228258.0,False,r/solana,public

When you are finished with your risky lp coins and buy/swap back mSol.. you're paying the slightly higher market gap between Sol-mSol for the time that you didn't own any mSol. I'm other words, you're buying mSol on the market when you swap it back, and in that time it sightly increased in value (6% per year). I'm other words you aren't gaining 6% at all. Having spent the time to ""stake"" at marinade was completely pointless. You can skip that step and go straight to orca with your Sol.

The only way to combine the 6% from marinade is to hold mSol and join an mSol---some-other-coin Liquidity pool or just stake mSol for mdne on marinade and gain another small percentage in mdne rewards.

I am not trying to put you down, because I too didn't understand this when I started, but I hope I can help you or anyone else thinking getting msol is at all useful if you're farming anything other than mSol LPs. At least I can save you a step. Sol to mSol price is kept at a close 6%apy that marinade automatically grows the gap between those two pairs and is kept in check by market arbitrage. So the value of mSol is always growing slowly. Since anyone can buy or swap whatever Solana network coin into mSol and unstake it at marinades website for it's current Sol + staked value. It's value will only increase to YOU when you're holding it though in a direct relationship to Sol value. You won't even notice a difference until you've held a large sum for a long time, and let me tell you.. when the market is down on you, you won't give a shit anymore about the 6%apr.

[],,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,,,[],"Sorry I've explained it so many times before, I don't feel like typing something new.  So I will just quote a post I made on my Discord a few days ago if you don't mind.  You can replace references to Shinobi System below with whatever suitable validator you prefer:

mSOL is the token of marinade.finance.  Basically you trade them your stake account for mSOL tokens.  This is a custodial arrangement as they now own your SOL and you own mSOL.  They will trade you back your stake account for mSOL later, and the SOL you get back will be as much as you would have earned staking over that time period (minus extra fees; marinade charges 2% extra commission on top of their validators, and also charges either deposit or withdraw fees or both, I can't remember).  The fees and extra commission means that you earn a pretty low staking APY using mSOL - avg 6% over the past month vs 7.23% earned from Shinobi Systems.


So you start out about 1.23% APY ""in the hole"" with mSOL (which is equivalent to 19% commission).  So since you are effectively using a 19% commission validator, you will want to find some way to earn additional returns from the mSOL.  This is possible because mSOL is not locked in like staked SOL is, so you can now trade the mSOL for something else in defi to earn more returns.  For example, you could put it into the Orca mSOL-USDC pool and earn about 16% additional APY (however, to do so, you will convert half your mSOL to USDC and thus only earn half the staking rewards, so your effective APY will be 13%). 


Therefore a strategy like I just mentioned will overall earn 13% APY using mSOL versus 7.23% just staking with Shinobi Systems.  However, there are some caveats:

1) With the marinade strategy you are exposing yourself to many more risks.  You have two custodial arrangements (marinade owns your SOL and Orca owns your mSOL) and thus are risking failures, hacks, or rug pulls from two separate defi systems.

2) There are liquidity risks as well - it is possible for ""runs on mSOL"" to make it difficult to convert your mSOL back into SOL, although this is unlikely.  Still, it is a small additional risk.

3) If your goal is to maximize earnings, this isn't even the best way.  The best way is to use SOL directly in defi.  For example, if you skipped the mSOL part and just put your SOL into the SOL-USDC pool on Orca, you would instead make 26% APY.  This is TWICE what you earn with the equivalent mSOL-USDC pool.  Part of the reason for this is that you can be pretty sure that Orca stakes a large part of the SOL in that pool anyway and passes the staking returns through to you in large part.


So mSOL is in my opinion basically inferior for almost every use case.  If you want earnings with minimal risk, then just stake directly.  If you want maximum earnings, then don't stake at all and just use SOL in defi.


The simple fact is that all SOL that is not being actively used will be staked by whoever holds it anyway.

So if you put your SOL into defi, it's gonna get staked, or at least, the part of it that isn't actively being used for value.

And efficient defi systems will pass most of the staking rewards back onto you, just like marinade does.

The only difference is, that defi systems do not have a mandate to spread stake like marinade does.

You can assume that they will do some spreading since it's in their best interest to minimize their exposure to some kinds of risks, but they're unlikely to do the wide spreading that marinade does and unlikely to choose predominantly small validators like marinade does.
In my opinion that's pretty much the only advantage of marinade: it's a convenient way to spread stake widely to a large number of small validators.  It has no other real benefits: no financial benefits since as I showed, it's inferior in returns to other strategies.  And no liquidity benefits since you can get better liquidity using orca pools.",,,,1647245784,{},i0leg5t,False,t3_tdhafv,False,False,t1_i0kzupf,/r/solana/comments/tdhafv/just_curious_why_would_people_lend_on_solend_with/i0leg5t/,1665219227.0,6,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,,0,[],,[],text,t2_cqgpowc,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
