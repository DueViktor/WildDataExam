Essentially yes.

&gt;That's assuming that the only utility of the token is to pay for it's transactions though. The underlying utility is different than that for both BTC and ETH.

For BTC sure, it needs to hold a value because it is meant to be a currency.
But for Etherium, not really.  It is a general purpose smart contract blockchain. Storing information, writing and interacting with smart contracts are the main functions, and to be able to do this you need ETH to pay the transaction fee. Of course secondary usecases have come up over time, like ETH becoming a currency and store of value of it's own, collateralization of DAI, and with proof of stake tokens used to secure the network.

Ethereum isn't supposed to be used for paying for coffee. If you want to get donuts with Eth you can do that using for example [Flexa Network](https://flexa.network/). I'm sure there are others too, this is the one I've looked into. 

Also, the Ethereum L1 isn't supposed to be used by users, it's supposed to be a settlement layer for the L2s. You'll have your cheap fees there.


Regarding why gas fees need to stay high - well, if gas fees were cheap Ethereum would be more vulnerable to lets say DDoS attacks for example.

[],False,,acinomrahg1,,,[],,,,text,t2_1qo4v2nx,False,False,"We are still building ethereum. Strategy for ""Scaling"" has evolved but my current understanding is that Sharding does not hit until 2023 and is a function of ""trimming some fat"" from the blockchain itself. It's related to ""graphing"" databases, or dividing large databases into smaller more manageable parts. Sharding will be like 64 ""mini chains"" working in tandem as the main chain. The idea is that the Ethereum database will be so big, a validator will be able to validate a transaction with access to only 1/64 of the historical data. It will use crazy smart math to do this. So this will help the main chain. BUT! The roadmap also includes moving the majority of consumer traffic OFF the main chain or moving ""computation"" off of the main chain. Computation on the main chain is expensive. You would not use a ""bank wire"" to pay a 2$ bill at starbucks and don't/won't wont use ETH. Not directly. Consumer traffic is going to move to ""layer2"" or the ""computation"" or ""transaction"" layer.  It might be helpful to think of ""layer 2"" like the apps on your iphone. It would be very hard (and very limiting in terms of inovation) if APPLE had tried to own and manage all of those apps as part of IOS. IOS would suck. Layer2 Coins like loopring that are launched as eth layer2's get all the benifits of scale/security/credibility of the multi-hundred billion dollar ETH mainchain, but can operate outside if it, fast and cheap. 
The cost to leverage this multibilliondollar infrastructure is a nominal ""gas"" fee. We have been talking about expensive gas sonhow can this be? Think of layer2 transaction blocks (sometimes called ""rollups"") as carpoolers. 
In this world, 1000 of us are in the car buting coffee at the window. The carpool administrator, the one who sold you ""coffee coin layer2 ""keeps records of the coffee buys and then bundles  them all together and submits a mathmatical ""proof"" to the ethereum mainchain, on your behalf. Or really its behalf. You are not mentioned by name in the eth block the layer2 submits. The fee on ethereum is still the $25 bucks, and the carpool admin or in this example, ""coffeecoin"" still pays the $25 in ETH to The validator or virtual miner as gas, but as a user of coffeecoin, a layer2, your ""share""'of that fee is .025 cents, on a 2$ cup of coffee is like 1%.  In the future, if this works, the biggest users of the ethereum mainchain will be layer2s. So ""loopring"" will be a huge ETH customer. Maybe you'll still buy a house or transfer large sums with ETH but in the world laid out in the ethereum riadmap, ethereum becomes somthing of a utility, running in the backround, a fully functioning comptation enabled internet. Now, those fees, the ethereum fees didnt go down. Not really. The layer 2s still pay them, but as a user, you are sharing that fee with 1000s of other users because you conducted your business through a layer 2. Maybe its like going to a comercial bank instead of direct to the Federal Reserve for groceries? I think the aps/IOS is a better metaphor. 

The layer 2s will be purpose built, like optimised for whatever type of computation is required- So, loopring to build swaps and Dexs, maybe  another to mint NFTs on- perhaps layer2s will get tied into social clubs and spread tribally.  
Sharding also and at some point as well ad chain  indexers like the ""graph"" will become the stewards of the state chain indexing, saving, and selling access to the data. This will also ethereum to shed mkre weight as its history gets latger and larger every minute. So the scaling of ethereum is really shedding of all things not  related to security off into different pieces if the eth  ecosystem. In some ways, eth of the future will represent somthing like a bank, but function more like a utility.  If thisndoes not make sense, read the ethereum roadmap. It'svery smart, and its changes since the guy you know who knows about thisnstuff read it 3 years ago...Dont let my  poor post turn you off ethereum - i'm still learning, and can see a LOT of us are still learning.

We split the state and history of Ethereum up into partitions that we call “shards”. For example, a sharding scheme on Ethereum might put all addresses starting with 0x00 into one shard, all addresses starting with 0x01 into another shard, etc. In the simplest form of sharding, each shard also has its own transaction history, and the effect of transactions in some shard are limited to the state of shard of that same shard. One simple example would be a multi-asset blockchain, where there are many shards and where each shard stores the balances and processes the transactions associated with one particular asset. In more advanced forms of sharding, there exists some form of cross-shard communication capability, where transactions on one shard can trigger events on other shards.

DOT on the other hand (if you just lend it and don’t have it staked: has a 5.38% APY and 9.5% para rewards). You can borrow regular DOT right now at a -14.53% APY. You can also then “Martin” or leverage stake the borrowed DOT to earn 14.5% on those and the additional para rewards from lending out the resulting sDOT. Please keep in mind you are entering into additional layers of risk by doing this. I’ve got a very small amount borrowed just kind of giving it a test run. (Keeping my health above 10…).

The additional para rewards of 8.4% right now are the only thing that really make this profitable unless I’m missing something. At least at the current borrowing rate which does fluctuate based on the percentage total that is currently loaned.
