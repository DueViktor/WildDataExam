Once staked am I able to unstake a small amount say once a month? I know I need to wait 28 days so I would have to plan ahead. So unstake say 500 Dot and leave the rest staked.

For example, you can use LDOT as collateral to mint aUSD(3% interest rate to borrow). Then turn around and maybe do a stable swap pool on Zenlink with moonbeam or the upcoming stable pool that’s coming to Acala or any lending protocol that will accept aUSD on Polkadot, etc. and then try to earn more than 3% and you make money simply but just minting aUSD with that LDOT.
