Could a person in North Korea acquire 32 ETH and participate in PoS? Almost certainly not. At the same time, could they acquire enough GPU units to deterministically mine their own ETH? Almost certainly not. 

Could that same person somehow acquire a share of an ETH staking pool? Maybe, though IDK what good it would do them. Could they acquire a GPU powerful enough to mine in a pool? Maybe, although I'd bet probably not. If there were a Venn diagram of ""regions that allow crypto purchases"" and ""regions that allow GPU sales and mining"" it would basically be a single circle. 

There is a more significant difference between PoW and PoS during the bootstrapping phase, that's true. Letting people mine on commodity hardware is a great way to get a very wide distribution of coins while PoS coins are forced into airdrops, ICOs, or to VC allocations. The additional sell pressure from mining also helps distribute coins. But Ethereum isn't in the bootstrapping phase anymore, and it already has a very wide distribution of coins. Once you're past the initial distribution, the advantages PoW has quickly go away. If Ethereum wants to have a long-term sustainable monetary and security policy, it has to switch to PoS.
