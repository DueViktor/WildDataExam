&gt;Shouldn’t the means of exchang match changes in GDP. A stagnant measure like bitcoin is deflationary and doesn’t represent real economic output instead.

GDP is the measurement of how much money was exchanged doing business. In other words it's the *velocity* of money, **not the supply of money.** It makes no sense to trying adding to the supply of a currency to match the change in GDP because then you are just arbitrarily changing the supply in ways that will feed back into changing GDP artificially.

&gt;A stagnant measure like bitcoin is deflationary

The supply of Bitcoin is neither inflationary or deflationary. When people say Bitcoin is deflationary what they're really saying is that the cost of goods are deflationary. This happens because more goods (and more types of goods) are being produced while the demand for primary goods generally remains the same.

That is to say, a decrease in the price of goods represents the increased ease in production of that good such that we can make a lot more. If you were to debase the currency in order to push the price of that good back up to where it was you are hiding that increase in the efficiency of producing that good.

But guess what else happens? It pushes up the price of other goods too, regardless of whether they have become more efficient to produce. So maybe your food stays the same price because we have been making huge technological progress in producing food with less labor, but homes have remained scarce with much more demand than supply.

Furthermore, because the currency is being debased people don't want to store their wealth in it. Instead, they search for things like homes to store their value, which artificially increases the demand for homes making them even more expensive.

This shows how changing the money supply always has negative effects on the assets which are in most demand (also known as hard assets). A fixed supply does not push the prices of the market either direction. It doesn't artificially inflate anything and it doesn't artificially deflate anything.",382392bd78ccba24c039c56f393d4b9909ebdc02,True,False,,,,,0,1653604109,,0,{},ia4fmtc,False,t3_uy6mld,False,True,t1_ia49407,/r/Bitcoin/comments/uy6mld/michael_saylor_we_could_create_100t_of_value_in/ia4fmtc/,1653604122,1,True,True,False,Bitcoin,t5_2s3qj,r/Bitcoin,public,,0,[],,

&gt; aren't safe because if you want to look up how many coins are stored in the wallet, you would have to rely on a third party service and trust them with that.

Not really, it's a private key. You can enter it into a wallet one way or another without 3rd parties. You'd never enter a private key into an internet connected machine or a website.

&gt;  As long as I'm not running my own node I'd always have to trust third parties right?

You can import those keys into software wallet. For example Electrum has a ""Import Bitcoin addresses or private keys"" on it's wallet creation screen.

If entering private keys you'd still do this offline though of course on an airgapped machine which never touches the internet now or in the future.

&gt;  couldn't I just import my paper wallet and solve the issue that way?

Paper wallets, unsafe... ""Sweeping"" rather than ""Importing"". 

You want to transfer the Bitcoin out of that address and into one by which is part of your Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet by ""Sweeping"", rather than ""importing"" it which may not handle the change address correctly.

Yup, Strikes announcement was a lightning integration with Shopify, NCR, and Blackhawk. I highly recommend [watching the entire announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD2-T7TX2rk) because the implications are cheaper transaction fees for merchants, merchant control to receive either Bitcoin or USD (via stablecoins), and the ability for consumers to use either custodial or non-custodial (and totally private) payment solutions on the other end (given lightning is an open network).

So this means we can now start a currency war under the hood of our retail purchases by choosing to support retail stores that declare Bitcoin reserves, choose to keep Bitcoin payments in Bitcoin, or even better declare that USD payments also convert into Bitcoin.

But this also means payment systems are being integrated in ways that will support legal taxation policies.

&gt;Thats going to be a glorious day

Fucking hard agree :)

&gt;Its what they are good at

Yup, I think it makes sense that the further away from reserve status you are the faster your currency collapses. I think we will see a lot more countries get dollarized and accepting Bitcoin as a second legal tender to act as savings.

Unfortunately, due to Bitcoins need to grow (and thus be volatile) I think this will initially give the dollar a lot of strength. That's why I don't see it collapsing until many others go down and Bitcoin grows much larger and stabler.

&gt;Except that the internet deletes place, ID, nationality, address, and all the static factors that rely upon it.  
Even today, you could be a tech nomad, with no fixed address, roaming internationally, working for bitcoin where ever the internet is good.  
I know people who do it. I cant say exactly how they deal with their taxes, but I know for sure its damn near impossible to audit them. Who do they work for? What is their income. What is their address. Noone knows. They just float around.

If you are participating in self-managed gig economy work, yes. That's what I was alluding to. But you'll have to find clients on your own, rather than using the websites that help cater creators with clients.

Also, while you may avoid taxation the stores you are shopping at cannot. Retail is largely consolidated into chains, small businesses using Square type products, Amazon, or smaller online retailers using services like Shopify. The majority of business is not coming from digital nomads.
