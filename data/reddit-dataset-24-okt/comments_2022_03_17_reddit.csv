&gt;Although the term orphan block is still commonly used to refer to those generated blocks when two miners manage to solve a block almost simultaneously. Since the network does not accept and distribute the generated block instantaneously, but rather presents a delay, it may happen that another miner solves exactly the same block. Thus two blocks are generated in a very close time, and both are distributed to the network for validation. There will be miners distributing one of the blocks and they will start solving the next block based on the hash of the received block. For their part, there will be other miners who received the other block generated first and will also begin solving the next block.  
However, there will come a point where a miner finds the solution to the next block based on one of those generated simultaneously. And that's when the miners will take the longest chain. That is, the block from which the next block was generated will show a greater Proof of Work (PoW) and therefore, it will be accepted within the blockchain. While the block with the least amount of PoW, it will be discarded, and therefore, it will not be added to the blockchain. These types of blocks are known as invalid or expired blocks, although they are more commonly called orphan blocks.",df223fda1be5303eba2c2608cbc370e3c7e1d311,True,False,,,,,0,1647473505,,0,{},i0y8ymb,False,t3_tfn612,False,True,t1_i0wsta7,/r/Bitcoin/comments/tfn612/why_is_1_confirmation_not_enough/i0y8ymb/,1647473523,1,True,True,False,Bitcoin,t5_2s3qj,r/Bitcoin,public,,0,[],

If you are willing to wait till you are home for your coffee, you can both have coffee and buy a hard money asset.

The real issue is that the younger people tend to value bullshit like ""culture"" and ""personal identity"" so much that they all go and gravitate to little work ghettos where they can spray their stink all over their unsustainable economies they build while racking up debt... ""fashionably."" All the while whining about how their choices aren't sustainable and old people made it that way!

So you have one side all piled into the same places and winning the vote there by lots'n'lots where you have people who do not value that lifestyle choice at all filling out the other 99% of the country.

That's because that entire faction is leaderless and pointless. They could move to where rent is cheap, where debt isn't bad... but then they'd not be in the consumerist heart of whatever shitty trend they want to be a part of. Where I'm at a lot of ""i'm too old for this shit"" moved out to and completely took over a suburb which is far more progressive than where the, uh, body-art emphasizers call home in the city. At 1/3 of the rent, with far more resources to actually organize. 

Meanwhile the suburbs are still the suburbs, people who bought-in and prospered still exist and are doing fine, no matter what scare story is plastered on the popular channels.

Anyone serious about their ""protest"" would leave their oases and actually make change in those places that accumulate those on each side. 

But they don't, so fuck 'em.

If you have a problem with ""how votes end up"" if you can even get past how they are obviously a sham for a layering of reasons, what is anyone actually doing about it besides posting on reddit in their own bias bubble?

Are we moving to the stronghold county of ""the other side"" and starting an opposition group?

The terminology in general is beyond fucked, and I feel like this renaming has made things even more confusing, because now people are referring to the roadmap by the name of a network layer.

To put it simply, Ethereum is becoming a modular cryptocurrency network. Current Ethereum, as well as almost all other cryptocurrency networks, are monolithic in design; that is, the one chain is responsible for consensus, execution and data storage for the entire network.

Ethereum is splitting the network up into three distinct layers, with each layer being given the responsibilities listed above:
- The consensus layer, comprised of the beacon chain. The beacon chain acts as the backbone of the post-merge Ethereum network, and is responsible for coordinating and securing everything going on within the post-merge Ethereum network, hence it being referred to as the consensus layer.
- The execution layer, comprised of the mainnet chain, the chain we're currently using. The mainnet chain is responsible for executing transactions and storing user accounts and smart contracts, and will be connected to the beacon chain to become the first canonical shard of the post-merge Ethereum network, hence being indirectly secured by PoS through the beacon chain.
- The data layer, comprised of a number of data-only shard chains. These shard chains will only be able to store raw data, essentially offering mass data storage to the execution layer, and will be connected to the beacon chain as subsequent shards, hence being indirectly secured by PoS through the beacon chain, much like the execution layer.

By splitting the network up, each layer can be optimised specifically for its own responsibility, which streamlines the upgrade process and makes things way more efficient.

Prior to this ""Eth 2.0, Consensus Layer"" rename, the first two layers were referred to as Eth2 and Eth1 respectively, but this obviously added to the confusion as the consensus layer shared the same name with the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap, which is why it was renamed to the consensus layer.",c79abb04b83ab6d5e2d3eb7c6f0e40bcea88402d,True,False,,,,,0,1647478892,,0,{},i0ykx6p,False,t3_tfj636,False,True,t1_i0yec6k,/r/ethereum/comments/tfj636/no_more_eth20_but_wait_not_what_you_might_think/i0ykx6p/,1647478906,1,False,True,False,ethereum,t5_2zf9m,r/ethereum,public,,0,[],

Yet that's exactly what the 51% attack enables. Having 51% of the hashrate ensures very effectively you can mine blocks faster than everyone else combined.

&gt;The real censorship threat is regulatory and PoS makes that significantly worse by consolidating stake into the centralized exchanges that have to abide by regulations and blacklists.

Regulatory isn't a threat to a decentralized blockchain, because decentralization first requires being non coerceable. If regulation can coerce a'y blockchain, it's not a decentralized blockchain anyway.

&gt;It's well known that exchanges have blacklists of addresses that they have to seize funds from. Its not a far stretch to imagine the govt insisting that coinbase or kraken not include transactions from the blacklisted addresses in the blocks that they produce.

Sure. Only means you're forbidden to use some centralized exchanges. Not the matter. 

Besides, if these stakers are censoring, thus being malevolent, you can always slash them away and do without them. You're just completely ignoring the very defense mechanisms PoS relies on.

No need to imagine it, since China has already providing a real world example.

I entered in 2016 and sold nothing since, my buy price was $10 per eth.. Irrelevant. 

The point I'm making is that it is not inclusive. Ethereum will not be a world computer if it serves a centralised few, that's just more of the same. 

The cryptoanarchist in me sees the signs of greed and control oriented fluffy governance and I reject that. 32 eth is a monetary expression of the sentiment of the leadership.
