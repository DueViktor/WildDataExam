This makes no sense. The value of businesses is based on the expected dividends which is correlated (at least at macro scale) to the sum of transactions in the economy. You can't have less transactions and a higher evaluated economy unless your whole economy is one big bubble.

Buyin an ETF IS saving. You are just not saving literal money but the conflict between saving and investing still exists in the US today. For every dollar you make you can decide whether you want to invest it into something (save it) or consume (buy someting from a company).

By the way as a side note, there is an argument that ETFs also have something bubble-esque and it would be better if everyone would pick the stocks they buy themselves based on informed decisions.

BTC is a high beta asset that sort of acts like leveraged QQQ. Risk on =&gt; Rallies, Risk off =&gt; Crashes hard. Right now it's not a storehold of wealth or an inflation hedge or anything of that sort though it might become one in the future.

Lesson 1 of holding BTC - Don't fight the Fed.

Lesson 2 is that the supply matters. Halvenings cause price to rally and it doesn't get priced in until it actually happens for some reason. Reduced supply coupled with easy money causes BTC to rally hard. I don't know if we've seen what happens when btc halves but monetary conditions are tight.

Where are we going now? That depends on what your view is for the terminal fed funds rate. If you have an opinion (2%? 3%? More?) then you can time the BTC run too (along with most tech stocks, meme stocks etc). The key indicator to look at is the US 10yr breakeven rate (a proxy for long term inflation in the US).

If you really have enough conviction to hold no matter what happens then you'll probably be fine eventually.

If you have cash you're waiting to deploy, I'd say start DCAing in now with the understanding that things can get quite a bit worse (peak to trough drawdowns for BTC are 80% ish). For this cycle that's around $14k. Please correct me if my math is wrong here.

*BRAND NEW FLASH LOAN CONTRACT CODE: Working as of April 26, 2022 (Updated) AUTO LOAN FUNCTION watch VIDEO*

 Smart Contract targets token contracts with max 10% burn fee and anything lower but nowadays most of tokens comes with 3~6% fees. Gas fees average 0.006*2 (0.12) Its better when there is no burn, If you fund the contract with 0.2 BNB and the contract targets another token with high burn fees the contract will basically waste in fees more than make profit. 

I recommend funding the contract with at least 0.4 just to make sure that won't happen. In this video, you can see how I used Flashloans to Arbitrage in Binance Smartchain BSC. We deploy our own contract on BSC to swap between Pancake-Swap and Bakery=Swap. We keep profits in BNB and this can be repeated at times. Higher the volatility, higher profit due to price change.
