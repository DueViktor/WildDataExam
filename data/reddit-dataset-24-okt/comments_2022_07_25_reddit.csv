Either you're delegating validation to someone else by staking as low as ~0.01 ETH in the form of rETH or you manage a mini-pool. rETH is a liquid staking token that allows people (once unstaking is implemented) to unstake and take the amount of ETH backing rETH, aka what's been generated by the staking rewards. It means rETH allows stakers to profit from staking through capital gains only. It's a huge benefit for anyone who has no capital gain tax (looking at you, Switzerland). For the moment, I think it's close to 1.05 ETH per rETH. 

As for validators, each one of them can choose to stake from ~17.6 ETH to a lot more. They earn depending on how much they put at stake and let rETH holders earn the rest depending on how much rETH holders fund the rest of the validator's mini-pool.

They just help to facilitate the transfer ownership of something in a purely digital way. Return periods are common practice for purchases of many things, so I don't see why that wouldn't be the case when the purchase is made digitally.

EVM equivalent will be most ideal as it runs exactly the way the original EVM runs. 

Bytecode equivalent runs the solidity contracts only because the bytecodes are interpreted the same way as how EVM does but it only emulates how those bytecodes would be run on an EVM. The issue here is there is a chance the emulation isn’t perfect. Is this correct?

Finally, for zkSync, it’s solidity compatible in that it actually has its own type of bytecodes. It doesn’t read the EVM bytecodes. But we can recompile solidity to its own version of bytecodes so that it can run them as how our solidity codes are intended.
