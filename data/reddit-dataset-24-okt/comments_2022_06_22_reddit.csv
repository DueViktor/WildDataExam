Centralization isn't about having all messages being passed by as many people as possible. It's about the possibility of replacing any service provider by another. So, any traffic analysis claiming that X% of the traffic could be censored by any specific actor just means that this actor is currently doing its work and no one tries to replace it because there's no use for it anyway. 

The second this actor misbehaves is the second when you'll actually see whether the network is resilient or not. How many people will be able to replace one service provider with another? This goes for L2s providing block production services as much as ISPs. 

This is this question of how easily people can switch for each service provider that I was expecting to see detailed in here, but all I see are key points that are so unimportant I'm failing to see why I should consider the opinion of these people as relevant: if they couldn't see their own key points are irrelevant, what to say about the rest of their analysis and report?

If there are a finite set of people/capital willing to serve as validators across any number of L1s, there is a massive loss in efficiency by dividing that pool up and fragmenting it over many L1 chains. You want consolidation of capital in the L1 space to maximize base layer security. After that, you can make tradeoffs in how your L2s plug into the L1 such as storing data off the L1 on Polygon Avail or Celestia, or making your batch time window very large to amortize as many transactions as possible.

When you see that gas fees of ""30 gwei"", that means ""30 gwei *per gas*"". And ""gwei"" is just the name for a billionth of 1 ETH (i.e. 1 gwei = 10^(-9) ETH = 0.000000001 ETH)

The bare minimum amount of computation in one ethereum transaction is 21,000 gas. They did the math and figured that's roughly how much computation is involved by checking the digital signature of the sender. So when you're sending ETH from one wallet to another, you're paying for 21,000 gas. (More complex stuff like a swap on Uniswap can take ~120,000 gas so that's gonna be ~6x more expensive than your regular transfer)

Putting it all together, we get that 21,000 gas √ó 30 gwei/gas = 630,000 gwei = 0.00063 ETH = about $0.70 at the current price of 1,130 USD per ETH

Instead, like all complex technology, the better objective is to abstract and simplify to the point that everyone from all walks of life can use the technology.  To make it so idiot proof that mistakes and accidents and exploits are virtually impossible.  We're getting there, but in the meantime, keep building, keep stacking, keep creating, keep contributing.

The real issue is the negative propaganda that must be fought coming from old money, old middlemen, who want to protect their exploitive businesses and ability to tamper with the value of centralized currencies.  They will fight and fight hard to insure their children and grandchildren are always the socialites, the wealthiest, the most powerful in society. And, they'll get lots of parrots to chirp anything they say.  At least they've finally stopped the ""but crypto is for drugs"" chant.  Who knows what they'll move to next.  ""It's upsetting our business"" maybe.

[],False,,Perleflamme,,,[],,,,text,t2_13pqgo,False,False,"No need to be very educated or technical. Here's a list of use cases that are already being provided non stop (disclaimer: not only on Ethereum, but in the whole ecosystem):

LivePeer: cheap transcasting of video format into streaming format, so that it's easy and cheap to compete against YouTube. 

LBRY/Odyssey: video platform. 

Golem: cheap generic computation platform. 

GitCoin: project funding platform. 

FileCoin: cheap cold storage platform. Cheaper than AWS cold storage options. 

PoolTogether: lottery without any loser, rewarding winner only with gains of low-risk investment in index-like financial products. 

Uniswap / sushiswap: investment and token exchange. 

AragonCourt: cheap decentralized jury courts (notably used by DAOs) for conflict resolution. 

Brooklyn microgrid: cheap peer-to-peer exchange of local electricity. 

The concept is pretty simple: you find a market about any service; you find the centralized middlemen; you replace them by decentralized middlemen, ideally in a peer-to-peer network. Blockchain has proven to be particularly efficient at doing that. The consequence is that management and middlemen aren't having that much power on the market and therefore aren't taking much of the profit. It's a redistribution that also ensures each party, being paid for their results, is incentivized to be as productive as possible. It's a huge efficiency upgrade, at a small cost (because PoW isn't needed, it's just some consensus we used at first and that isn't required anymore). 

So, sure, blockchain is complex and requires more computations than just having one centralized database storing it all. But that's because blockchain does much, much more than just storing on one centralized database. It shifts the organization of our economic activities. 

So, people could claim all they want that ""we could do this, we could do that"". Well, then, do it. Just do it. Trying to do what blockchain does isn't new, that's true. But succeeding is new. 

And that success comes from the fact it is based on game theory just as much as it is based on cryptography. Most devs who complain about cryptocurrency simply ignore game theory (which is understandable, since it's not their job to begin with). Miners of Bitcoin didn't mine for fun. They mined because they believed in that digital ownership they got and that, some day, people will want to own it too due to how useful it is. 

Try to achieve the same results as Bitcoin but without these incentives keeping all actors going into the same direction and you'll end up with garbage because of the lack of such incentives. You'll end up with all attempts that were tried and that failed or that provided minimal effects in specific use cases where costs are small enough and no profit can be made from breaking the system. 

People who claim there is no use either are disingenuous liars or are gullible enough to baselessly repeat any claim without having even looked for any counter-example of their claim. That list is a proof of it, coming directly from reality. 

But that is quite expected in nowadays cultures to have so many people being so gullible, where skepticism is so underrated and where there's that belief arguments of authority aren't fallacies.",e6c6b2cff2d78eea03b9504d44060ff8ee2bfa53,True,False,,,,,0,1655861221,,0,{},id92zll,False,t3_vhscdb,False,True,t3_vhscdb,/r/ethereum/comments/vhscdb/i_feel_like_no_one_outside_of_our_industry/id92zll/,1655861239,1,False,True,False,ethereum,t5_2zf9m,r/ethereum,public,,0,[],,

**Why is Nobody Talking About the Ethereum Merge?**

If there‚Äôs one event in the cryptoverse that has the potential to be more disruptive than the Bitcoin halving ‚Äî that would be Ethereum‚Äôs move to Proof of stake(PoS).

Referred to as ‚Äúthe merge‚Äù ‚Äî the transition to Proof of Stake on Ethereum mainnet is due to take place this summer, and this is definitely the most positive news that you‚Äôll hear during this bear market.

Once it‚Äôs live, this will have deep implications in the cryptocurrency world and beyond. It could even threaten Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance and first-mover advantage. In this article we‚Äôre going to discuss these implications as well as do a quick pulse-check on the merge is going so far.
What is the Beacon Chain?

According to ethereum.org ‚Äúthe Beacon Chain is a ledger of accounts that conducts and coordinates the network of stakers. It isn‚Äôt quite like the Ethereum Mainnet of today. It does not process transactions or handle smart contract interactions.‚Äù

This represents the new consensus engine (or ‚Äúconsensus layer‚Äù) that will replace of proof-of-work mining with proof-of-stake.

This will make Ethereum a lot more energy efficient, by allowing users to stake ETH in order to activate a validator software. By being a staker, you will be running node software that processes transactions and creates new blocks.
Ethereum Merge Status

The Merge has successfully taken place on the Ropsten testnet. There have even been successful testnet transactions validated using Beacon Chains‚Äô proof-of-stake on Ropsten Network.

Sepolia testnet is now next up to undergo the Merge, with its Beacon Chain being officially live and ready to go as of today. Once that‚Äôs confirmed to be working as expected and safety checks are all finished ‚Äî the Merge will then take place on the mainnet.
Implications of ETH being PoS

This is where we discuss long-term implications of Ethereum becoming proof-of-stake and why it‚Äôs such a big deal.

It could be the Bitcoin Killer

Remember the time that Tesla started accepting Bitcoin, only to backtrack a month later saying that Bitcoin used too much energy to be adopted by a green organisation? While that was probably not the reason itself, it‚Äôs not the first time that Bitcoin is being accused of not being entirely sustainable, due to its energy consumption.

Whether or not these concerns are valid, or whether Bitcoin‚Äôs energy consumption is actually significant in comparison to the international banking system, that‚Äôs irrelevant here.

What is relevant is the fact that multiple organisations and states have raised these concerns, and every decision to accept Bitcoin as legal tender will be faced with the aforementioned concerns.

Proof-of-sake uses around 99.95% less energy than Proof-of-Work ‚Äî making Staked Ethereum a much more appealing value proposition for widespread adoption.

If Ethereum didn‚Äôt already present itself as an improved and tested alternative to Bitcoin adoption, the advantage of it being a lot more energy friendly compared to Bitcoin, is one that would be hard to ignore in the eyes of organisations and governments alike. The main reasons why you won‚Äôt see states going for the newest layer 2 solution or more recent blockchain and efficient PoS chains, is because they haven‚Äôt stood the test of time ‚Äî yet.

Ethereum and Bitcoin have, and now Eth is due a massive upgrade which will inevitably boost widespread adoption. Of course, all of that assumes that Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt develop a more efficient consensus mechanism as well.

It could reverse the bear market

Staked Ethereum will bring a whole new consensus mechanism, that will make Ethereum a lot more scarce due to reduced issuance.

Reduced issuance coupled with the right adoption event, could potentially cause a paradigm shift in the market. Once large-scale event seems to be enough mark a bear market (Terra ‚Äî 2022, Bitconnect ‚Äî 2018) ‚Äî it stands to reason that the opposite should hold true to mark the start of a new Bull run.

Under the right circumstances, such an event is the drop that will ripple through the cryptoverse and only make Ethereum more popular. People will start accumulating due to FOMO ‚Äî and just like that ‚Äî we have a brand new bull market.

It could truly lead cryptocurrency adoption

You can see how most of these themes are in one way or another, related to cryptocurrency adoption. The thing is, staked Ethereum will finally get governments to shut up about how unsustainable blue-chip cryptocurrencies are, and how they won‚Äôt be adopted. Here you have the first and most secure smart contract platform our there, that just became 99.95% more energy efficient.

The Ethereum Merge is second to none when it comes to cryptocurrency paradigm shift, and I can‚Äôt stress enough how odd it seems that people don‚Äôt talk bout it enough. The merge will irreversibly impact every crypto believer out there, and have extensive ramifications that we won‚Äôt even know about in the beginning.

But there's nothing forbidding a decentralized platform to exist and provide peer-to-peer short rent of homes, food delivery and such. 

The most beautiful part is that people don't need to know it's on a blockchain anyway. There is a service, it's available. If it's cheap and useful, it will be used. The fact the data lives in a PostgreSQL database, in DB2 or in any blockchain is completely irrelevant for end users. 

Fear is why people don't invest. But it won't be why they don't use it. They don't use it because, currently, most people have no use of it anyway. And that's exactly why Warren Buffet's criticism of cryptocurrencies it still relevant. It's just that he lacks vision of the future of such tech, which is understandable. 

And that's exactly why I think the next cycle will include use cases on L2s. L2s are nearly ready. They only need use cases. 

As any cycle, there will be many useless service providers on L2s, but there will be some that will provide. And that will way more closely look like the dot com bubble, with lots of service providers being created and then ceasing to exist.  Once blockchain will be all hype, service providers will have the name on it, with ""DAO"" or such  being in nearly all their names. And then, the hype will pass and new service providers won't put ""DAO"" on their names. They'll just be defined by themselves instead of the tech behind them.

Nothing in an authority provides value to an argument.
