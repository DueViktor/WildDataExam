imgzl9j,t3_x20h7z,"What do you expect when people just interact with metamask thinking that this is ethereum. 

“Full Node in Every House” needs to be a slogan. If you can’t even be bothered to do that, you won’t be bothered to read that book.",t3_x20h7z
imgsoqc,t3_x20h7z,"This is obviously a repost, but some of the posts in here are just awful in regards to how Ethereum works, and some of the user issues people are having are scary. I'm kind of shocked that most people have absolutely no understanding of the system. It seems like we have nudged people into believing there are ""tokens"" and ""wallets"" and even ""tech support"". While the bear market is raging, I encourage people who have a substantial amount of their net worth to actually read this book. It's somewhat old and some things have changed, but some of the basics still stand and it's still required reading.

Maybe we can even do a reading group if people are genuinely scared and don't understand Ethereum?",t3_x20h7z
imibf2c,t3_x20h7z,"If you are interested, you can also use this article. It's about how exactly Ethereum and  Ethereum 2.0 work. https://www.cryptologi.st/news/ethereum-20-all-you-need-to-know?utm\_source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cryptologi.st%2F&utm\_campaign=reddit&utm\_id=reddit",t3_x20h7z

imk9vkd,t3_x20h7z,"This isn't even half of it with the merge and all the post-merge shenanigans that are planned. 

Ethereum has always struck me as the kind of system that only a bunch of extremely smart geeks could ever even understand, much less create, and together they came up with a system so incredibly complex that no single individual among them not even Vitalik can understand it all. Therefore nobody really understands it and even if they did, based on the premine history etc -- would you trust them to put your savings into it?",t3_x20h7z
imhovkl,t1_imhkz2f,"Nuanced but the underlying smart contracts are immutable - the ""head"" contract modules pointers can be changed.",t3_x20h7z
imhmbjv,t1_imhkz2f,"Sadly, yes.",t3_x20h7z
imgzxpu,t1_imgzl9j,Metamask is even a stretch. Most people only interact with coinbase or binance.,t3_x20h7z
imhqxre,t1_imgzl9j,"Ethereum full node in your house, you need a pretty beefy setup right?",t3_x20h7z
imit3cl,t1_imgzl9j,Full archival node imo. We should stop relying on Concensus to be the validator,t3_x20h7z

imkhqpk,t1_imgsoqc,I believe that Ethereum can't ever have mass adoption if it scares people who have no clue about it.,t3_x20h7z
imlam9q,t1_imk9vkd,You basically explained how the internet works today. I've been working as a software engineer for 10 years and I have no idea how TCP/IP works. Ethereum will be the same.,t3_x20h7z
imhsi4t,t1_imhovkl,Exactly. The user also doesn't have the option to keep using the old version of the contract since the data is bound to the proxy.,t3_x20h7z
iml3hpt,t1_imhovkl,The underlying proxy contract is just used as storage. You can still potentially change that by updating the implementation contract either with a different storage layout or with new functions that can change previous ‘immutable’ stored data,t3_x20h7z
imhsdy8,t1_imhqxre,"No, I have a cheap PC from a few years ago. However for the most common client you need a fairly big SSD drive - if your computer doesn't already have one it'll cost you about $100 to buy one to plug in.",t3_x20h7z
imhwuhp,t1_imhqxre,no even a raspberry pi with an ssd is fine.,t3_x20h7z

imlpx7e,t1_imlam9q,Hmm I must have missed the part where TCP/IP had a 70% premine and also fails the Howey test,t3_x20h7z
imlkud8,t1_imhwuhp,Raspberry? I can't use apple? I'm out!,t3_x20h7z
imq4ody,t1_imlpx7e,"That's a bad thing? There's large swaths of our internet held together by toothpicks from engineers that have to basically beg Google and Amazon for funding. It would have been much better if people charged for it and used tokens, and the first engineers made enough money on it to devote their entire lives to it. There was a whole thing a few years ago how the maintainer of the email protocol basically had to beg for money. It's pretty shameful how people have gotten so used to free shit that they don't reward the developers who built this place. I would love if they let it all fall apart and re-do everything on cryptocurrency rails.",t3_x20h7z
in2q623,t1_imq4ody,"If you think they Internet is held together by toothpicks, wait until you hear about the phone / telecommunications systems. 

Shit is comical, I'm surprised it even works lol",t3_x20h7z
