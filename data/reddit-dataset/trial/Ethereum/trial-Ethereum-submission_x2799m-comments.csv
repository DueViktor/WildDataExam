imhwogk,t3_x2799m,"> what is a dogcoin or memecoin going to provide for us as a society?

Why does anyone have to answer that question?

If you don't think dogcoins or memecoins or whatever are worth spending money on, then don't. If other people want to spend money on them, they can. ""Vitalik's vision"" isn't some holy canon.

And besides, I think his vision was to create a shared computer that anyone could use for whatever purpose they wanted. So dogcoins and memecoins fit just fine into that.",t3_x2799m

So I'll say the same thing again too. The internet wasn't invented for porn or for Reddit, but here we are.

We don't get to make value judgements on what people build or use open systems for. Build and use what you want to and it will sort itself out.",t3_x2799m
imhw53w,t3_x2799m,">Donâ€™t get me wrong, Iâ€™m not trying to ruffle any feathers, but what is a dogcoin or memecoin going to provide for us as a society?

Think of it as fundamental research. It's fascinating realizing people can just create money simply by themselves. Even more so with just a meme as a symbol! And it results in the creation of communities, just like some NFT collections. Just like DAOs. Except that DAOs are an infrastructure so that the community can govern itself. But they aren't required either to have a community recognizing itself. Meme coins and NFT collections are alternatives. 

Besides, it didn't require lots of funds to create these meme coins. The fact of putting money to buy the tokens won't do much. It's not an expense. 

NFT collections were much more expensive, but only because their creation was ill-designed. 

There is much to do and I completely agree with you that there are many possible projects that could benefit the community. But meme coins aren't either a loss.",t3_x2799m

Those at the top of Maslow's pyramid usually have learned that empathy is beneficial for the community. It thus behoves them to assist, or at least defend the less well-off.

Perhaps 'moral obligation' is overly strong; I'm simply suggesting that the fortunate **should** feel the need to help others.",t3_x2799m
imk7miq,t1_imk0sa1,"I see this as analogous to the ""supporters of free speech will defend the right for people to say things that they themselves disagree with"" philosophical stance. I support the right of people to code programs that I disagree with.

And the blemish of the TheDAO bailout aside, Ethereum is founded pretty strongly on that philosophy too. There isn't an asterisk next to it with the footnote ""except for *those* kinds of smart contracts"".

By all means, when someone writes up a dapp that's clearly a scam or a waste of money or whatever, tell their prospective customers what you think about it. Warn them off of using it and explain why. But I draw a hard line at Ethereum trying to prevent the dapp's creators from writing it in the first place. It is not Ethereum's place to make that call.",t3_x2799m
