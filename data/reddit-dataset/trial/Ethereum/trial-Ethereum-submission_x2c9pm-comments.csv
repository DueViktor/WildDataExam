imknz3j,t3_x2c9pm,"Interesting, a base-layer private transaction type. Unless they've come up with some incredibly clever way to make it ""free"" (relative to non-private transactions) I hope it remains optional, to better support the use cases that don't require it.",t3_x2c9pm
imii2q9,t3_x2c9pm,"tldr; Ethereum’s developers are realizing censorship is not a problem that can just be coded away. This piece is originally from Valid Points, CoinDesk's weekly newsletter, breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets.

imkqgct,t1_imknz3j,"I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be free. So, yeah, optional is the way.

But since it's optional, it's also why the EF considered it should probably be avoided in Ethereum Core, so as to ensure as much as possible can exist outside of core. But preventing censorship also is mandatory, as censorship-resistance is a non negotiable part of a decentralized cryptocurrency network. 

I guess that's an important part of the contradictions and compromises Vitalik talked about.",t3_x2c9pm
imks53i,t1_imkqgct,"Yeah, adding this to layer 2 rollups seems like the best approach overall. Then it can be optional or mandatory or nonexistent on a rollup by rollup basis, as needed.",t3_x2c9pm
imkt85h,t1_imks53i,"But the problem then is the L1 being able to censor any privacy-friendly rollup as a whole. I guess the nuclear option of a UASF is always available, but it's still better if we don't need it.",t3_x2c9pm
imkuvfn,t1_imkt85h,"Nuclear weapons act as a deterrent without necessarily having to use them, so having the technology ready to deploy might indeed be good enough to make it not necessary to make mandatory.",t3_x2c9pm
imkvzs9,t1_imkuvfn,"It's true, but nuclear options only work if people think you will use them against attacks. As long as it's not used at least once, attackers may consider it's a bluff and call what they think is bluff. 

That would be a monumental bluff call full of boldness, to say the least, but I wouldn't underestimate hubris. Human beings have proven there's no scarcity of hubris and that's all that is needed to end up with such stupid moves.

Besides, if politicians realize it's the end, why wouldn't they just call for the nuclear option anyway? We're literally shifting from a ""money is whatever we say and we control it to never run out of it"" to a complete lack of control for them. Even having a good chunk of money after decades of that level of control seems bland and meaningless.

The only way to prevent that seems to be moving so slowly we let generations of politicians adapt to the new standard. But we can't slow down the tech, even more so a decentralized tech. That's simply not possible. And the tech progress seems to go really fast, if not even faster over time. No way it's going to be slow enough for politicians.",t3_x2c9pm
iml7fai,t1_imkvzs9,"""Implementing shuttered transactions on L1"" doesn't seem like a particularly bad nuclear weapon to actually set off, though. So if politicians decide to ""call Ethereum's bluff"" and Ethereum shrugs and implements shuttered transactions in response, seems fine to me.",t3_x2c9pm
imlaly1,t1_iml7fai,"Oh, I agree. I was referring to UASF in the mean time.",t3_x2c9pm
imlb3cx,t1_imlaly1,"Ah yes, that's rather more of a destructive and divisive nuke. I'd rather not see that set off, it would open quite the can of worms.",t3_x2c9pm
