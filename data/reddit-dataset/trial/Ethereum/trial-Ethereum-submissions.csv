(Putting aside operational costs) if I were planning to build a new application, is there any *technological* reason why I'd be forced to choose an alternative L1 chain to settle on?

I know for example proponents of Cosmos and Polkadot have said Ethereum is unable to offer the same level of ""sovereignty"" as zones/parachains get, but it isn't clear if that's actually true given the possibility of building layer 3 chains on Ethereum. 

Thanks in advance,  
Nick"

In fact, the complete opposite is true and I think it’s a little ignorant not to learn about this and subsequently spread misinformation in the crypto space.

On the contrary to what these people believe, L2s will be the main focus for the Ethereum development team in the upcoming years as the merge happens and then dank sharding starts getting developed.

L2s won’t only be helping Ethereum scale its new beacon chain, they will literally become part of that chain down the line.

A lot of people are confusing merging with sharding and these two are not the same.The merge will not make gas on Ethereum cheaper, in fact, nothing will.

What the merge will do is significantly reduce power consumption (more than 99%) and pave the way for sharding which will in turn give a major boost of L2s and their throughput.Ethereum’s beacon chain will always be expensive to operate and will instead rely on L2s to handle the data.

In fact there are already scaling solutions being developed solely for that purpose most notable of which is Polygon Avail which will store data off chain and present only the data needed at the moment. This kind of scaling solution will drastically help with traffic and gas fees and will transform Ethereum into a much more efficient kind of blockchain.

So don’t go out thinking L2s will get phased out. Ethereum will rely on them heavily in the upcoming years.In fact Ethereum already relies a lot on L2s as I imagine the vast majority of us use them every single day."

x2799m,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/x2799m/just_because_we_can_use_ethereum_to_create/,"Just because we can use Ethereum to create anything, doesn’t mean that we actually should",10,41,1661931033.0," Vitalik’s main vision behind Ethereum was to create a decentralized ecosystem where the end goal decades later would be for people and institutions to get assimilated into and let go of the centralized grips of centralized tyranny.

Naturally, absolute decentralization means that anyone can create anything within the bounds of the Ethereum blockchain.

And while yes, using precious processing power and data to create a memecoin is completely okay abiding by the code of Ethereum, it completely disregards the main goal that Vitalik set in mind when created this blockchain.

Take it from this perspective. If we ever want businesses and individuals worldwide to start adopting crypto, we’re going to need use cases (aka dApps).

DeFi and DAOs in my opinion will be the major catalysts behind major crypto adoption.

DAOs like MakerDAO and AAVE give people the ability to lend and borrow money at anytime of the day regardless of a person’s age, ethnicity or background.

This bring a lot of value to crypto because its something that’s not available in the outside world.

There are also some other DAOs like BitDAO funding organizations like EduDAO to teach students on how to become Web3 builders.

There’s a ton of value in this because Web3 and blockchain related courses are still a niche that isn’t being taught in universities.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to ruffle any feathers, but what is a dogcoin or memecoin going to provide for us as a society?

How will these projects that have zero utility contribute to Vitalik’s vision?

Again, I know that “its my money and I can do whatever I want with it” but all I’m trying to say is that there should be a collective moral between all members of this community to help grow Ethereum and it’s utility in real life instead of funding memecoins and dogcoins on Ethereum"

I'm a farmer, by profession, if you can call it that. with that said, I feel that a strictly Farmland backed stablecoin, could do extremely well. 

The premise of the stablecoin (USAG or similar), would be used by a foundation to purchase class 1, 2, and 3 farmland throughout the world, mainly in developed countries which have highly productive agriculture systems (US, Canada, Australia, Eastern Europe to start). Farmland in the U.S. has not really depreciated over the past 40 years. The 30, and 20 Y.O.Y. return is roughly 7% and 13%, respectively. The farmland would be used as the collateral to issue the dollar pegged (or not) stablecoin.  Each piece of farmland can be put onto the blockchain, which would have three EXTREMELY beneficial use cases. 

**ONE**: This would lead to enormous cheaper future exchange of ownership (currently land exchanges can cost 15%-50% of the cost of the land. If the tract was on the blockchain, theoretically, the transfer of ownership would only cost the gas fee. Farmers and investors alike would be thrilled over this. 

**TWO**: Staking. Most people do not realize that majority of farmland is not owned by farmers but private individuals, in which they rent out. Farmland rent varies from $50/acre-$500/acre, depending on production of the land and the area. Farmland on the blockchain, which would be locked up as collateral, could be rented or ""staked out"" in a way, on a Decentralized app where farmers could bid on a land contract. This stake or rent normally runs about 4%-10% of the cost of the land per year. This Staking reward could be given back to token holders, or used to strengthen the balance sheet of the stablecoin, or both. 

**THREE**: Decentralization of Farmland. Personally, I find this the biggest value, and so should you. Farmland has been increasingly gobbled up by wealthy individual investors and corporate farms. If we continue this trend line out we WILL end up with an extremely centralized power that controls our food supply. This is probably the top concern with farmers, as well as consumers. It leads to farmers being completely controlled by a few major companies, which in turn controls to populous. Even in my 20 years of agriculture, the change has been freighting. This stablecoin could act as the catalyst to fight back for a more decentralized food supply. 

On top of the staking/rent, farmland hold a very steady inflation hedge, again running roughly 12% over the past 20 years in U.S. So, conservatively your running a return rate of 10%-20% YOY. I reckognize the major challenges this brings into question, and again this is simply a thought process for now.
