`model_setup`: The model setup consists mostly of the tendimensions git repository. (git@github.com:lajello/tendimensions.git)
To preprocess the data for the model we wrote "preprocess.py" and to classify each datapoint we wrote "model_setup/classify_text.py". 
However, as these were run on the HPC. 

To run the classification clone lajello's repository and follow the instructions in his README w.r.t. embeddings and nltk_tools. 
Then place the classify_text.py in the ten_dimensions directory.
