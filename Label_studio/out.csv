7,Bitcoin,"FFS...I keep hearing the same FUD about energy ""waste"".....
Let me make it super clear
You have been using ""your"" energy for pleasant dips in your hot tub (is this right or wrong? Who cares you like your hot tub) and then BTC comes along. You like the idea of securing an asset through POW that is also paid in the same asset. It's got alot of future potential also so you start mining......but now you can't take as many dips in the hot tub. Oh well you value BTC more and more so less and less dips in the hotub.....maybe you transition to no hotub or maybe it's some equilibrium OR you decide you want both how do you do that? Increase the amount of available energy....now you can hotub and mine BTC.
That MORE energy benefits everyone because whether it is less waste, new type of power or a different way of doing business it is not isolated to a single person, those ideas/plans/blueprints will be used by every other society.....because more energy means more ""life"".",1648300541,t2_16qssz,i26t7m4,Comment

But when it needs to send $100, and XRP is worth $1, and there is only 50 XRP they can gets their hands on, the price must go up to allow supply to actually complete the transaction.

I don't seem to be making as much as the APR suggests and I'm wondering if there is something I'm missing. I am farming on both Raydium and Traderjoexyz for different types of crypto. I have a similar amount invested on both sites with a similar APR in both farms but on trader joe I'm earning about 2 times more per day and seems inline based on the APR. The way I am calculating the expected amount is by taking the ""Deposited"" amount shown in the farm \* the APR% / 365. Example if Deposted amount is 500 and APR is 35% I would expect:  
(500 \* .35) = 175 / 365 = .4794 cents per day

26,solana,"Very weird situation with Phantom Wallet -  I created a Phantom Wallet a couple of months ago. As the creation process completed, I noticed that there were more than just one wallet available, between 10 to 30 of them.

Some of them already had multiple transactions dating back before I had even created a wallet. I thought nothing of it and didn't touch it until now.

Got back to it, and everything was as is. Going through the activity of the wallets which have SOL in them, I saw that since I had last opened it, more transactions had occurred, however with smaller amounts.

All wallets are in the Mainnet Beta network, and nothing unusual stands out. I also understand that people have found themselves containing SOL amounts in wallets connected to the Devnet and Testnet networks, which isn't real SOL, instead being values used to test wallet actions. Only four Network options are available: Mainnet Beta, Devnet, Testnet and Localhost.

Obviously I had to try and see if the amounts shown were available to transact, however everything fails. It isn't possible to send values between the wallets available on Phantom, nor to external wallets such as Coinbase and Binance.

I created a different wallet on Chrome this time, to see if this was normal or not, and as expected, only one wallet was created on Chrome.

I really have no idea what I got myself into, as I can't find anything resembling this situation.

This is my last resort before sending a ticket to Phantom Support.",1651966109,t2_mfy0n1yp,ukp5c4,Submission

First of all I am not a programmer, but an artist and as we know OpenSea already supports Solana NFTs I decided to list my 1k collection on it. But the problem is there are very few resources how it can be done on OpenSea. It's not like the Ethereum NFT resources online.  

I have Phantom wallet and I've tried to create an OpenSea collection but Solana chain is locked and I don't know how to unlock it
