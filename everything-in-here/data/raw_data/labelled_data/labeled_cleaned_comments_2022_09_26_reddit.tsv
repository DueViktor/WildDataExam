Is Michael Saylor a steward of Bitcoin? - lets say yes for the sake of this discussion

Are others not stewards of bitcoin / are others opposed to bitcoin? (answer is obviously yes)  
and;

does that make a difference? 

for example, does it make a difference if the parties who own/control bitcoin, are stewards of it or are against it's very principles?   


I believe that the answer is yes, that it makes a huge difference if those who own bitcoin believe in it's principles. That means you're more likely to hodl it, you're more likely to use it as it was originally intended, and you're less likely to follow senseless media hype.

Not necessarily. For example, the Fed is currently ""burning"" base money by letting the bonds it owns roll off its balance sheet (i.e. it is burning the coupon payments). Sometimes the Fed burns base money faster than this by selling the bonds before they mature and burning the proceeds -- this is quantitative tightening.

&gt; Money is destroyed when a loan is ... written off (as a bad loan).

This is not true. Writing off a loan reduces banks' assets, but it doesn't reduce the amount of USD deposits (unless the entire bank goes bankrupt).

&gt; The borrowers agree to repay the loan balance plus interest.

Right, and some borrowers will pay back the loan plus interest while others will default an not pay back the loan at all (let alone with interest).

On average, the bank can still expect to get mack more in loan payments than it loaned out. The interest the bank earns goes to:
 - interest payments to savings account depositors at the banks (and people with CDs at the bank, etc.),
 - expenses associated with implementing checking accounts and other overhead (e.g. debit cards, fraud detection, etc.), and
 - profits, which go to the banks' shareholders.

&gt; Where is the interest supposed to come from? New loans!

It can come from any of those places (e.g. money lent to borrowers who defaulted; interest payments on savings accounts; salaries of bank employees; dividend payments on bank stocks).

&gt; Inflation, then hyperinflation.

When inflation is above target, you don't need new loans though -- loan repayments can come from shrinking the existing money supply (at least until inflation gets back on target).

In this case, it is the Fed's job to tighten credit until inflation gets back on target, reducing the money supply as much as needed.

&gt; THIS TIME we have a choice

No one is forcing you to save USD today though. In fact, it's one of the easiest assets to short -- you can borrow USD against a wide variety of assets."	c2894dc03a109504c10a37c8f92d32ee440e0dea	True	False					0	1664090719		0	{}	iptbcri	False	t3_xmq3np	False	True	t1_ippw9z5	/r/Bitcoin/comments/xmq3np/you_cant_print_forever_and_think_you_can_get_away/iptbcri/	1664090733	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]			 gt the central bank must print forever not necessarily for example the fed is currently burning base money by letting the bonds it owns roll off its balance sheet i e it is burning the coupon payments sometimes the fed burns base money faster than this by selling the bonds before they mature and burning the proceeds this is quantitative tightening gt money is destroyed when a loan is written off as a bad loan this is not true writing off a loan reduces banks assets but it doesn t reduce the amount of usd deposits unless the entire bank goes bankrupt gt the borrowers agree to repay the loan balance plus interest right and some borrowers will pay back the loan plus interest while others will default an not pay back the loan at all let alone with interest on average the bank can still expect to get mack more in loan payments than it loaned out the interest the bank earns goes to interest payments to savings account depositors at the banks and people with cds at the bank etc expenses associated with implementing checking accounts and other overhead e g debit cards fraud detection etc and profits which go to the banks shareholders gt where is the interest supposed to come from new loans it can come from any of those places e g money lent to borrowers who defaulted interest payments on savings accounts salaries of bank employees dividend payments on bank stocks gt inflation then hyperinflation when inflation is above target you don t need new loans though loan repayments can come from shrinking the existing money supply at least until inflation gets back on target in this case it is the fed s job to tighten credit until inflation gets back on target reducing the money supply as much as needed gt this time we have a choice no one is forcing you to save usd today though in fact it s one of the easiest assets to short you can borrow usd against a wide variety of assets 	0.002269590739160776	0.9889982342720032	0.10568759590387344	0.9524329900741577	0.007994397543370724	0.23446960747241974	0.08366338908672333	8.312069326166238e-07	0.2851000726222992	0.002645805710926652

Otherwise, my God would have died in vain. He is about freedom of choice. At least He is in my eyes.

Unfortunately, it is the nature of people in power to retain control of their subjugated citizenry. Something has changed, and that is the global village. World leaders are struggling with sharing power on the global stage while making their citizens happy at home. It's easier to control what people think if you control the truth you want them to hear and make that truth support your position as leader and decision maker. Our free press and open society are thorns in the side of secret keepers.

In an autocratic society, it is easier for the leadership to control the flow of outside information. Religion isn't the guiding global force it used to be, so new leaders who aren't religious will want to ""reeducate"" religious citizens to the national view just as religious tyrants would kill or assimilate people into their dominant faith-based society. We are moving closer to Orwell's 1984 type of government. Go back and look at what our country did after 9/11 when the Patriot Act was passed. It was a religious attack and retaliation, but the Patriot Act opened the door to a secret police state that could have been maintained without due diligence by the media and citizens who understood the threat presented by unchecked government power.

This is not the purpose of r/Bitcoin.

* Do not trust unsolicited messages telling you to check out some shady website.
* Do not trust Discord randos telling you that you won a prize.
* Do not trust anyone who promises guaranteed profits.
* Do not trust website with unpronounceable domain names
* Do not trust anyone claiming to give away free Bitcoin. (YouTube, Twitter, Discord)
* Do not trust anyone claiming they will double however much Bitcoin you send them.
* Do not trust 'pretty girls' on Tinder telling you about new investment opportunities.
* **If you have to ask** if some sketchy website or special offer is a scam, **then it probably is.**

You have to learn to think for yourselves. Recognize that there are many tricksters out there who will go to great lengths to separate you from your Bitcoin. Use your head and stay safe. If you send your Bitcoin to a scammer, it's gone forever. There are no refunds!

You've provided no supporting evidence.

The reality of the matter is the person you responded to is correct.  

And from a certain perspective you are also correct.

Inflation is indeed adding additional currency to the money supply.  Inflating a balloon. 

Historically the value was pegged to gold.  If you divide gold up into more symbolic pieces you're inflating the supply reducing purchasing power.

If you inflate the supply while adding additional gold.  You're not reducing purchasing power.

Now that we have conflated money and currency value and medium of exchange respectively.  Inflation is no longer a applicable concept in the central banking system, but its still important to understand the purchasing power.

So modern economist attempt to measure the effects of inflation to measure inflation.

This sounds reasonable, but prices don't decrease only do to money supply reduction.  Prices decrease due to technical advancements and efficiency gains.

So the central banking system is designed to rob people of their purchasing power overtime through inflation.  

Shit gets out of control because they play political games measuring the CPI consumer price index in a way that is favorable to governments.

Austrian economists tend to overstate the intensity of inflation and cause alarm.  This makes them come across as the boy who cried wolf... However in reality they aren't wrong and the central banks keep sheering and sheering the sheep.

So when everything blows up the austrians will say I told you so, but the central banks will say even a broken clock is right twice a day and the cycle will continue."	2a69e2155506b333fd93698eef9fbb30328bddbe	True	False					0	1664106303		0	{}	iptulzd	False	t3_xngl0a	False	True	t1_iptrcqh	/r/ethereum/comments/xngl0a/ethereum_eth_inflation_has_fallen_nearly_95_since/iptulzd/	1664106317	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]			so firstly you re conflating feeling with thinking you feel that the person you responded too is incorrect you ve provided no supporting evidence the reality of the matter is the person you responded to is correct and from a certain perspective you are also correct inflation is indeed adding additional currency to the money supply inflating a balloon historically the value was pegged to gold if you divide gold up into more symbolic pieces you re inflating the supply reducing purchasing power if you inflate the supply while adding additional gold you re not reducing purchasing power now that we have conflated money and currency value and medium of exchange respectively inflation is no longer a applicable concept in the central banking system but its still important to understand the purchasing power so modern economist attempt to measure the effects of inflation to measure inflation this sounds reasonable but prices don t decrease only do to money supply reduction prices decrease due to technical advancements and efficiency gains so the central banking system is designed to rob people of their purchasing power overtime through inflation shit gets out of control because they play political games measuring the cpi consumer price index in a way that is favorable to governments austrian economists tend to overstate the intensity of inflation and cause alarm this makes them come across as the boy who cried wolf however in reality they aren t wrong and the central banks keep sheering and sheering the sheep so when everything blows up the austrians will say i told you so but the central banks will say even a broken clock is right twice a day and the cycle will continue 	0.0026990806218236685	0.988760769367218	0.8357676863670349	0.032186612486839294	0.008256352506577969	0.28553855419158936	0.07023408263921738	8.457188869215315e-07	0.19935467839241028	0.026483381167054176

Nomad has a shorter challenge window (for it's optimistic bridging). Fuel v2 might use a shorter challenge window too.

With even 4-8 data shards, even if spun up dynamically for a large fee, we could make optimistic methods far more viable with very strong UX ~forever.

Fortunately, I'm not arguing just for the sake of it. I'm ensuring people can easily spot inconsistencies and fallacies so that discussion brings interesting conclusions rather than ones that are inconsistent with reality. 

&gt;It doesn't matter if you and I waste our time, but this is a place where many other people read. Please don't make them waste their time.

No one can waste the time of readers, don't worry: they read whatever they want.

&gt;Thank you. You're the most hostile person to me in Reddit

If by hostile you mean someone who challenges unsupported claims and fallacies, rather than nodding in complete lack of care, then you can say I'm hostile. I'm not seeing myself as hostile to you, though. Sorry if that's not how you see it. 

Skepticism is a strong skill to develop. I'd suggest you to master it. You'd become more critical of your own thoughts and writings, which means you'd write less fallacies and would be in less of a need to have so many points being challenged all the time. 

If you've written a book about economics, you're supposed to be accustomed to people reading your writings and providing arguments about what is unclear, logically wrong, irrelevant, ill-phrased, disorganized, misleading, orthographically wrong, and many other mistakes you should avoid when finishing your book. It's a sane practice, not a hostile one. 

&gt;you admit that the exchange rate on the Ethereum platform and the Justice platform is 1.5:1.

What I confirmed is that you're implementing a money laundering system. Misinterpret what I said however you want. Anyone can judge what is written based on what is written.

&gt;There is already enough basic technology for it.

I have explained the impossibility isn't about technology. It's about two premises being contradictory by design.

I'm not argumentative just for the sake of it. I see a claim that isn't supported by an argument or only by fallacies, I challenge it. It's expected to happen like that in a discussion, because you're otherwise never sure what you say is relevant or just completely false.
