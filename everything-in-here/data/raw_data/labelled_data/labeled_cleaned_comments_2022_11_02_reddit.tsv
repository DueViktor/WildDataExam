No such thing as a majority of nodes  

Try to understand Bitcoin's actual use, and the money flow. I want to buy shoes and I have a coin to spend. The coin is a transaction output from an existing transaction somewhere on my copy of the blockchain. I send my coin to the shoe shop. If the shoe shop's node's blockchain has my coin, then I get to buy the shoes  

If the shoe shop's blockchain doesn't have my coin, the shoe seller calls his node Bitcoin. I have my coin and I call my node Bitcoin. But they're not the same chain, so it doesn't matter what we call it  

The shoe shop accepts my coin, and sells it for dollars. He finds a Bitcoin buyer. The buyer has a node. The buyer's node has this coin on its blockchain, so the shoe seller can sell the coin  

How did these coins and transactions get onto our three separate copies of the Bitcoin blockchain? Some miners mined blocks containing our transactions. Those miners are also following the same consensus rules and extending the same blockchain on their nodes  

Anywhere in this money flow, one participant may claim ""we accept (or buy or sell) Bitcoin"" but actually be following a different chain. They're not lying or cheating. They just have a different point of view. They may even belong to a supermajority network, but it's a different network, so they're unable to participate in the same money flow as the other participants  

Nodes can not be counted. Supermajority is a social concept. Every player can choose which chain to follow, and indirectly they're choosing who to transact with. If everybody who calls their coins Bitcoin follows the same consensus rules and the same blockchain, this makes Bitcoin useful"	06ae2a449f842af89a076a087983f7c5b6b0c38a	True	False					0	1667274010		0	{}	iul37hw	False	t3_yimak6	False	True	t1_iujcx80	/r/Bitcoin/comments/yimak6/why_is_it_that_bitcoin_core_gets_updates_quite/iul37hw/	1667274028	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]			 gt majority of nodes no such thing as a majority of nodes try to understand bitcoin s actual use and the money flow i want to buy shoes and i have a coin to spend the coin is a transaction output from an existing transaction somewhere on my copy of the blockchain i send my coin to the shoe shop if the shoe shop s node s blockchain has my coin then i get to buy the shoes if the shoe shop s blockchain doesn t have my coin the shoe seller calls his node bitcoin i have my coin and i call my node bitcoin but they re not the same chain so it doesn t matter what we call it the shoe shop accepts my coin and sells it for dollars he finds a bitcoin buyer the buyer has a node the buyer s node has this coin on its blockchain so the shoe seller can sell the coin how did these coins and transactions get onto our three separate copies of the bitcoin blockchain some miners mined blocks containing our transactions those miners are also following the same consensus rules and extending the same blockchain on their nodes anywhere in this money flow one participant may claim we accept or buy or sell bitcoin but actually be following a different chain they re not lying or cheating they just have a different point of view they may even belong to a supermajority network but it s a different network so they re unable to participate in the same money flow as the other participants nodes can not be counted supermajority is a social concept every player can choose which chain to follow and indirectly they re choosing who to transact with if everybody who calls their coins bitcoin follows the same consensus rules and the same blockchain this makes bitcoin useful	0.0019975120667368174	0.9899840354919434	0.4643392562866211	0.04560196399688721	0.007007109001278877	0.4370572566986084	0.12187990546226501	8.32765238101274e-07	0.4403395652770996	0.005270690657198429

In August 2017, the Bitcoin chain was forked. A couple of exchanges posted notices - if the BCash hashrate exceeds the Bitcoin hashrate, then BCash wins the title of ""the real Bitcoin"". Those exchanges have regretted their stupidity ever since  

Similarly, your ""most nodes"" question makes no sense. Nodes do not vote, can not be counted. Bitcoin consensus is a supermajority  

A Bitcoin node is operated independently. From my point of view as a node operator, I choose which consensus rules to follow, and that defines which supermajority I belong to. Whether that network is called Bitcoin or Creecoin is interesting only to marketing creeps  

See https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Prohibited_changes

&gt; would the bitcoin token on this fork initially (in the first minutes of its existence) have a low market value?

The price of Bitcoin is determined by parasites known as speculators. They are irrational.

They restricted private use of Gold and bullion. They offered a buyback of $35 similar to the Gold Act of 1900. So I don’t think the Government truly could force anyone to hand over their XRP. If that happened what’s to stop them from confiscating anything else they deem valuable? We have a constitution for a reason. Anyway… They’d offer a buyback of XRP and the next question would be, how much for my XRP? Better be nothing less than $10k per XRP.
