147	[]	False		Plane_Baby			[]				text	t2_76de0bem	False	False	"You are correct owning 51% the currency will get you nowhere (unlike the current system (or proof of stake)). The power of Bitcoin comes from two places, the miners and the nodes. If you owned 51% of the mining, you could try to do something but Satoshi thought of this.

Please read the Bitcoin white paper. It is only 9 pages long. Don't get me wrong, it is dense. Here is one section to explain a little bit more: 

""Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority
decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains. **To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass thework of the honest nodes.** We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching updiminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.

To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time,the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number ofblocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases."" (Satoshi, 2008)

Bitcoin has a few properties that others have not figured out yet: **Decentralization. Limited supply. Immutability. Fast global transactions. Permissionless. Trustless.** Additionally, it has an **immaculate conception.** Bitcoin begun when the technology had zero value. People helped to make it better because of the technology, a property that could be transferred with a third party. During the time it had no value, people made it better. Most importantly, the founder, Satoshi, left the project and never spent his Bitcoin from the genesis block.

If the US puts their might to attacking bitcoin, it maybe too late. The US would need to have to have the political will to do it. If you noticed earlier this year (Mar 9, 2022) Biden released an Executive Order to lead in the space. üôÑ One thing that politicians are learning is that they need to select a side. As more people make money in the crypto space, they are gaining influence. For example, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried donated more that $5 mil to Biden. Now he and other PACs are planning to donate to crypto friendly politicians. More importantly, Jack Mallers, Strike+NCR project, to add lighting network to many stores, reducing transaction fees and removing credit card companies. Soon incentives of hurting voters will make it so politicians would not want to attack their donors.

*Note:* I am still learning about bitcoin. I have not been in it as long as many many others. However, I dedicated many hours to learning as much as I can about this technology because it will (is) change the world. The one thing I have learned is I will never understand it all.or know what the future holds but I believe bitcoin will have a major role (if on the backend or upfront).

TL;DR: Owning 51% of Bitcoin doesn't get you anywhere. Bitcoin properties are: 1) Decentralized. 2) Limited supply. 3) Immutable. 4) Permissionless. 5) Trustless. and 6)  had an immaculate conception. No other project matches this.

Inflation at the federal level is as simply as you can put it, how much a dollar is worth. The value of the dollar is only a small fraction of the increased costs you are facing in the supermarket. It's the costs of raw goods and shipping that you are paying for right now. It all comes back to labor shortages, material shortages and the cost of gas. Inflation will take longer to fully be included in the CPI and can be offset by increasing wages and improving GDP.

In simple terms 10% inflation means nothing if you get a 10% raise and US GDP increases accordingly because we get more money for the things we make.

And fortunately, what you're getting as a reward for your investment right now is... tokens.

That said, I'm pretty sure it can still be mocked too. How they're ensuring they're not cheated is a good question. Maybe the fact of having the device turned on and being used for many reasonable steps a day (aka not having thousands of steps per second, notably) is enough to ensure the reward is lesser than electricity cost of the device or such. So, they may have a monetarily low upper bound of what any account can earn on any day/hour/minute/whatever. In which case, cheating the process isn't profitable anyway.

Your choice of document reader doesn't really matter and macros are disabled by default. Just never ever allow them to run unless you know exactly why - your milage in your office may vary if management uses macro docs (same is true for excel files btw).


Background:

Macros used to be used because they were fairly universal whereas .COM files were often less reliable.

Yes, to have a better approximation, we would need to perform the same comparison with different services and then ""average"" the prices out. But I don't see how changing the number of users would dramatically change the results, since it would impact both sides of the equation (more gas vs more transaction costs), so it would even out (more or less).

Cheaper gas would indeed lead to a higher dollar price for 1 ETH.

475	[]	False		GassyGertrude			[]				text	t2_29hsepjv	False	False	"If you want a serious answer there are several reasons. Blockchains sell blocks, that's their product, it's what they do. Demand for blockspace is significantly higher on Ethereum as seen by the total $ spent securing the network/tx fees. It has been in the range of 20-100x the fees Bitcoin has for a while. You can see some charts here: https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/on-chain-metrics/comparison-bitcoin-ethereum

Now why is this important? Transaction fees are the core mechanism securing the network from adversaries. Bitcoin's network security is 20-100x ""less"" than Ethereum's - it would cost an attacker $500k/day in fees vs $10-$50M+/day on Ethereum. With the transition to proof of stake the monetary value securing Ethereum and thus needed to perform an attack will go into the billions starting day 1 of PoS. When institutions like banks, sovereign wealth funds, etc adopt crypto it will either be in a centralized form such as a CDBC or they would opt for the chain that has the highest amount of security. With Ethereum being the most secure network that will inherently attract the most capital. However that is just one part of the story.

As you know each halvening decreases the block rewards, with Bitcoin relying solely on transaction fees come 2140. The question then becomes will transaction fees be enough to secure the network? The effects of decreased block rewards and increased dependency on transaction fees will be felt long before 2140. If everyone just accumulates and holds BTC, what other incentives are there to transact on the network? It cannot sustain itself if the only thing it offers is the ability to buy/sell BTC and nothing more, it's utility built on top of that which drives high tx volume and thus tx fees. Also with each halvening if BTC has not doubled in value (and tx fees have not significantly increased) then it is jeopardizing the security of the chain. There is yet another part of Bitcoin's model that amplifies this problem, which is the fact that when miners receive their block rewards they immediately go to sell it to pay electricity costs. There is constant downward pressure on BTC the asset from those securing the chain in order to pay the bills to run their hardware. So not only do you have block rewards decreasing with no utility driving additional tx volumes but you have this constant downwards pressure from miners themselves. The worst outcome of this would be miners dropping out and thus further reducing the network security of the chain. Alternatively there's increased centralization risk as economies of scale with hardware force small miners to drop out due to tighter operating margins/higher costs to run. There's many more topics and vectors that tie into all of this (MEV, quantum computing, social consensus/""layer 0"" and the soft vs hard fork difference between BTC/ETH, PoW vs PoS security efficiency/spawn camping/slashing, historical data &amp; tradeoffs/effects on miners, the client diversification debate, etc) but if you're genuinely interested in learning I'd highly recommend reading more into the nitty gritty details separating Bitcoin and Ethereum."	87fc122bc53fecfd7f5386f44160b2614dd10416	True	False					0	1654135692		0	{}	iav3zlx	False	t3_v2mbf6	False	True	t1_iaus8b9	/r/solana/comments/v2mbf6/wtf_get_it_together_solana_a_blockchain_has_to_be/iav3zlx/	1654135709	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]			if you want a serious answer there are several reasons blockchains sell blocks that s their product it s what they do demand for blockspace is significantly higher on ethereum as seen by the total spent securing the network tx fees it has been in the range of 20 100x the fees bitcoin has for a while you can see some charts here https www theblockcrypto com data on chain metrics comparison bitcoin ethereum now why is this important transaction fees are the core mechanism securing the network from adversaries bitcoin s network security is 20 100x less than ethereum s it would cost an attacker 500k day in fees vs 10 50m day on ethereum with the transition to proof of stake the monetary value securing ethereum and thus needed to perform an attack will go into the billions starting day 1 of pos when institutions like banks sovereign wealth funds etc adopt crypto it will either be in a centralized form such as a cdbc or they would opt for the chain that has the highest amount of security with ethereum being the most secure network that will inherently attract the most capital however that is just one part of the story as you know each halvening decreases the block rewards with bitcoin relying solely on transaction fees come 2140 the question then becomes will transaction fees be enough to secure the network the effects of decreased block rewards and increased dependency on transaction fees will be felt long before 2140 if everyone just accumulates and holds btc what other incentives are there to transact on the network it cannot sustain itself if the only thing it offers is the ability to buy sell btc and nothing more it s utility built on top of that which drives high tx volume and thus tx fees also with each halvening if btc has not doubled in value and tx fees have not significantly increased then it is jeopardizing the security of the chain there is yet another part of bitcoin s model that amplifies this problem which is the fact that when miners receive their block rewards they immediately go to sell it to pay electricity costs there is constant downward pressure on btc the asset from those securing the chain in order to pay the bills to run their hardware so not only do you have block rewards decreasing with no utility driving additional tx volumes but you have this constant downwards pressure from miners themselves the worst outcome of this would be miners dropping out and thus further reducing the network security of the chain alternatively there s increased centralization risk as economies of scale with hardware force small miners to drop out due to tighter operating margins higher costs to run there s many more topics and vectors that tie into all of this mev quantum computing social consensus layer 0 and the soft vs hard fork difference between btc eth pow vs pos security efficiency spawn camping slashing historical data amp tradeoffs effects on miners the client diversification debate etc but if you re genuinely interested in learning i d highly recommend reading more into the nitty gritty details separating bitcoin and ethereum 	0.0006132596754468977	0.9959698915481567	0.1491497904062271	0.9701706767082214	0.00352929113432765	0.020088039338588715	0.18151752650737762	8.503675985593873e-07	0.41752615571022034	2.906408735725563e-05

There are still plenty of upgrades, rollouts, mitigation strategies, growth strategies, protocols, and mechanisms for Solana to develop and implement, but we are getting closer... All of this and more comes from the recent developments on Solana‚Äôs Network; ranging from advancements in core platform optimization from QUIC Protocol, Solana‚Äôs improvements in user access and UX, investments and partnerships into several emerging sectors, and Neon EVM Technology.

Nonetheless, Solana‚Äôs Value has seen better days... After an exploit of the Wormhole bridge in February, there were further instances of degraded network performance and causing throughput issues. Solana may continue to experience network performance challenges and can further see a decline in financial performance via overall Network Value.

&gt;  
*Can you please explain parachain security and interactions in detail?* 

Oh, I could spend a long time answering this and there's only so much time allocated for the AMA...

At a really high level, when a parachain first connects to the relay chain, it submits its genesis block and its runtime (defining the state transition function). At this point, the validators on the chain (via the Wasm and genesis stored on the chain itself) can, given a set of transactions, verify if it is valid or not, by running them against the Wasm and the known state. Collators on the parachain send collations of transactions to a randomly selected subset of validators, who verify that the state transition is valid (since they know both the previous state and the state transition function (STF), defined in the Wasm blob containing the runtime).

Other validators can verify that this is correct and slash an offending validator who tries to cheat by saying an invalid state transition is valid, since all of them have access to the current state as well as the STF. A block on a parachain is not considered finalized until its equivalent state transition has been validated on the relay chain. Thus, a parachain depends on the security of the relay chain.

Of course this elides a LOT of detail and wrinkles in operation. If you want to dig in deeper, I really recommend reading the [Wiki page on the topic](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-availability#phases-of-the-anv-protocol), or if you want to really dive in, reading the chapter on [AnV (availability and validity)](https://spec.polkadot.network/#chapter-anv) in the [Polkadot Specification](https://spec.polkadot.network/), put together by our great Spec Team.

&gt;*How does XCM work?* 

XCM allows different chains to have a common way of interacting with each other using an ""Esperanto"" (common language) instead of every chain having to know exactly how other chains operate. 

This is obviously a very high-level description! For more detail, I recommend reading Gav's description in the Medium post here: [https://medium.com/polkadot-network/xcm-the-cross-consensus-message-format-3b77b1373392](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/xcm-the-cross-consensus-message-format-3b77b1373392) or if you really want to dig in, you can review the code here: [https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/59aa955576e963942c60e3ae8f8316444b66cafb/xcm](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/59aa955576e963942c60e3ae8f8316444b66cafb/xcm)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Is there technically a difference between XCM and XCMP?* 

Yes. XCM is the cross-consensus message format; XCMP is a cross-chain messaging protocol. Think of sending a tax form to your government via the postal system - the form you send is the FORMAT of the message you are sending them, a very specific format; the mail system is the PROTOCOL of how it gets there.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Can I be sure of the security when doing token transfers without having to trust the respective parachains? If yes how?*

Yes, because all parachains share security via the relay chain. If a parachain attempts to ""cheat"", it will be known to the validators on the relay chain (and is easily provable)."	7bded8dd446f52582c63a2c69ab37c50a3703f3b	True	False					0	1654177093		0	{}	iawsmru	True	t3_v2aft8	False	True	t1_iavyc9d	/r/Polkadot/comments/v2aft8/bill_laboon_ama_2_jun_1300_1400_utc/iawsmru/	1654177104	1	False	True	False	Polkadot	t5_2ublt	r/Polkadot	public		0	[]			 amp x200b gt can you please explain parachain security and interactions in detail oh i could spend a long time answering this and there s only so much time allocated for the ama at a really high level when a parachain first connects to the relay chain it submits its genesis block and its runtime defining the state transition function at this point the validators on the chain via the wasm and genesis stored on the chain itself can given a set of transactions verify if it is valid or not by running them against the wasm and the known state collators on the parachain send collations of transactions to a randomly selected subset of validators who verify that the state transition is valid since they know both the previous state and the state transition function stf defined in the wasm blob containing the runtime other validators can verify that this is correct and slash an offending validator who tries to cheat by saying an invalid state transition is valid since all of them have access to the current state as well as the stf a block on a parachain is not considered finalized until its equivalent state transition has been validated on the relay chain thus a parachain depends on the security of the relay chain of course this elides a lot of detail and wrinkles in operation if you want to dig in deeper i really recommend reading the wiki page on the topic https wiki polkadot network docs learn availability phases of the anv protocol or if you want to really dive in reading the chapter on anv availability and validity https spec polkadot network chapter anv in the polkadot specification https spec polkadot network put together by our great spec team gt how does xcm work xcm allows different chains to have a common way of interacting with each other using an esperanto common language instead of every chain having to know exactly how other chains operate this is obviously a very high level description for more detail i recommend reading gav s description in the medium post here https medium com polkadot network xcm the cross consensus message format 3b77b1373392 https medium com polkadot network xcm the cross consensus message format 3b77b1373392 or if you really want to dig in you can review the code here https github com paritytech polkadot tree 59aa955576e963942c60e3ae8f8316444b66cafb xcm https github com paritytech polkadot tree 59aa955576e963942c60e3ae8f8316444b66cafb xcm amp x200b amp x200b gt is there technically a difference between xcm and xcmp yes xcm is the cross consensus message format xcmp is a cross chain messaging protocol think of sending a tax form to your government via the postal system the form you send is the format of the message you are sending them a very specific format the mail system is the protocol of how it gets there amp x200b gt can i be sure of the security when doing token transfers without having to trust the respective parachains if yes how yes because all parachains share security via the relay chain if a parachain attempts to cheat it will be known to the validators on the relay chain and is easily provable 	0.002519454574212432	0.9891465902328491	0.5088304281234741	0.07489628344774246	0.007958395406603813	0.40640130639076233	0.08156201988458633	8.376222808692546e-07	0.3470822870731354	0.00813576765358448

Polkadot and Kusama are both independent and permissionless networks so anyone have equal opportunity to launch any project on Polkadot and/or Kusama. As such, Project Liberty will still need to launch on Polkadot or Kusama on their own merit and have DOT/KSM holders approve a parachain joining.   
There are several ways for projects to work with W3F or Parity - [grants](https://grants.web3.foundation/) (feel free to ask me about those specifically!), [Substrate Builders Program](https://substrate.io/ecosystem/substrate-builders-program/) etc.   All projects are equal and participation in substrate builders or getting a grant is not any guarantee that the project will take off or do well. Certain larger projects have different mechanisms of interacting with W3F (e.g., our grants to those building the Polkadot Host software - currently Parity, ChainSafe, and Soramitsu - are much more detailed and our interactions more close and ongoing due to that), and I think we're going to continue to see different kinds of interactions depending on the size of the project and the aims of the project itself.

Thank you! I do try to answer questions when I see them - it's not the primary part of my job but I do try to educate as much as I can.

&gt;  
With Polkadot's XCM working, are there further big changes to come one day? Or is it more about iterative improvements from now on (nominating system, move logic to common good parachains, etc) ?

With the addition of XCM and HRMP, all of the major parts of the original [Polkadot Paper](https://polkadot.network/PolkaDotPaper.pdf) have been achieved. However, that doesn't mean that no big changes are coming. Just a couple of examples that are being worked on now:

1. An entirely new and more decentralized form of governance - see [https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/5205](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/5205)
2. SPREE - Originally referred to ""trust wormholes"" (still my favorite phrase, if I am honest), these allow parachains to verify not only that another parachain will receive a message but know exactly how that message will be interpreted).
3. True parachain-to-parachain messaging with XCMP (instead of the HRMP channels which go through the relay chain)
4. Parathreads, allowing ""pay as you go"" access to the relay chain for para objects

  
Of course, this all depends on your definition of ""big changes"". Personally I think moving governance, staking, and even balance logic to parachains is a big change, but of course, it's nothing compared to the implementation of parachains themselves. But that does bring us to the next topic you brought up...

&gt;  
What is (the state of) Polkadot 2.0? It appears to be more a research project currently? Will findings be implemented in the current chain, and why is it versioned 2.0 in the first place?

I would say it's not even a research \_project\_ right now; some researchers are looking into the ideas, but there are no papers being worked on on the topics as far as I know. The big idea is the concept of hierarchical relay chains, where parachains can themselves act as ""sub-relay-chains"", which would allow some really amazing scaling to go on. But this has a lot of challenges which have to be addressed, and there are a lot of other things to work on at the moment.

While these major changes have been called ""2.0"", I think this is more of a way of putting together these large ideas for ""some big future release"". I wouldn't read too much into it by thinking it's an entirely new chain or anything like that.

&gt;  
And will the Polkadot reaping threshold be lowered one day? 1 DOT has been chosen arbitrarily and I would say it's almost unfair to consider 0.99DOT dust.

It certainly could be - it's up to governance to change it. Anyone could make a proposal to upgrade to a runtime that changes the [EXISTENTIAL\_DEPOSIT constant](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/a7860c8c3a7f70bd0de0029e79b0a1810a3848f3/runtime/polkadot/constants/src/lib.rs#L28)  to a different value. In fact, this has already happened on Kusama, where the ED was reduced to 1/50th of its previous value.

However, it's important to remember that space on the relay chain, in some sense, should be expensive; the more accounts there, the slower it is for everyone, and the relay chain is the central chain supporting all of the parachains. Parachains are the more natural home for accounts; the Statemint parachain has an ED of 0.1 DOT, 1/10th the value on the relay chain itself."	d53375dc024b78f62834e162323d28ccac79a943	True	False					0	1654175675		0	{}	iawps24	True	t3_v2aft8	False	True	t1_iareujd	/r/Polkadot/comments/v2aft8/bill_laboon_ama_2_jun_1300_1400_utc/iawps24/	1654175689	1	False	True	False	Polkadot	t5_2ublt	r/Polkadot	public		0	[]			 gt first it s nice to see you answering questions now and then here on reddit we appreciate it thank you i do try to answer questions when i see them it s not the primary part of my job but i do try to educate as much as i can gt with polkadot s xcm working are there further big changes to come one day or is it more about iterative improvements from now on nominating system move logic to common good parachains etc with the addition of xcm and hrmp all of the major parts of the original polkadot paper https polkadot network polkadotpaper pdf have been achieved however that doesn t mean that no big changes are coming just a couple of examples that are being worked on now 1 an entirely new and more decentralized form of governance see https github com paritytech polkadot pull 5205 https github com paritytech polkadot pull 5205 2 spree originally referred to trust wormholes still my favorite phrase if i am honest these allow parachains to verify not only that another parachain will receive a message but know exactly how that message will be interpreted 3 true parachain to parachain messaging with xcmp instead of the hrmp channels which go through the relay chain 4 parathreads allowing pay as you go access to the relay chain for para objects of course this all depends on your definition of big changes personally i think moving governance staking and even balance logic to parachains is a big change but of course it s nothing compared to the implementation of parachains themselves but that does bring us to the next topic you brought up gt what is the state of polkadot 2 0 it appears to be more a research project currently will findings be implemented in the current chain and why is it versioned 2 0 in the first place i would say it s not even a research project right now some researchers are looking into the ideas but there are no papers being worked on on the topics as far as i know the big idea is the concept of hierarchical relay chains where parachains can themselves act as sub relay chains which would allow some really amazing scaling to go on but this has a lot of challenges which have to be addressed and there are a lot of other things to work on at the moment while these major changes have been called 2 0 i think this is more of a way of putting together these large ideas for some big future release i wouldn t read too much into it by thinking it s an entirely new chain or anything like that gt and will the polkadot reaping threshold be lowered one day 1 dot has been chosen arbitrarily and i would say it s almost unfair to consider 0 99dot dust it certainly could be it s up to governance to change it anyone could make a proposal to upgrade to a runtime that changes the existential deposit constant https github com paritytech polkadot blob a7860c8c3a7f70bd0de0029e79b0a1810a3848f3 runtime polkadot constants src lib rs l28 to a different value in fact this has already happened on kusama where the ed was reduced to 1 50th of its previous value however it s important to remember that space on the relay chain in some sense should be expensive the more accounts there the slower it is for everyone and the relay chain is the central chain supporting all of the parachains parachains are the more natural home for accounts the statemint parachain has an ed of 0 1 dot 1 10th the value on the relay chain itself 	0.0026573892682790756	0.9882593154907227	0.2024165391921997	0.17503367364406586	0.008607369847595692	0.23306137323379517	0.10773573070764542	8.326969123118033e-07	0.3808531165122986	0.01896856725215912
