11	[]		Mallardshead			[]			dark	text	t2_g40kqtvx	False	False	[]	"Because Web 3.0 is actually sovereign computing. It's personal servers the size of credit cards in everyone's hands with zero technical knowledge required to use. This eliminates SAS, creates mesh networks, and circumvents ISP's altogether. This requires hardware and software. Companies like Start9, Umbrel, etcetera are at the forefront of this. Web 3.0 is not a tokenized orgy of swaps, wraps, burns, mints, and stakes run by dapps that do absolutely nothing but optimize token interactions to keep the tokenized orgy going. It's not a closed intranet (spelling of that word is important) with utility tokens run on 3rd party servers. More on that after the jump.

The majority of all ETH's validators (currently using the Beacon Chain before the Merge), are run by Centralized Exchanges. That number will increase after the Merge. And the majority of those validators and the remaining validators are hosted on AWS and Infura servers. That's a huuuuge problem. We already saw last week that Infura began blocking access geographically. And where do the majority of dapps and wallets acquire their API data? Platforms like Etherscan, which is 100% hosted on Infura. Metamask pulls all its API from Etherscan, and last week what did we learn about Metamask? They were actively blocking transactions from Venezuela to Eastern Europe.

Then there's Proof of Stake in general. With **Proof of Work**, a continuous amount of resources must be spent to mine. Proof of Work has its own free market, and its own economy of scale. There will be many times when it isn't even profitable to mine. With Proof of Stake however, the fat cats get fatter, and they never have to expend any resources, thus helping recreate the *Cantillionaire Effect*. It's the equivalent of a Senator getting elected to a lifetime term, who never has to work, and can set his own salary by colluding with his fellow Senators. It's actually worse than the current fiat system over time.

Then you have to ask yourself what money is. Is money TPS, TX cost, and throughput? Or are those all features of a blockchain? So far the only thing having established itself as money within the Ethereum Network are stablecoins, which is probably why they make up a staggering 85% of all the network's volume. That's called *Gresham's Law.*

The real version of DeFi, the real goals of Web 3.0, and decentralization at large, will naturally build themselves around a global stateless money--no tokens required. Something that values simplicity, which is a fundamental security practice. Something with the one-dimensional goal of separating money from State.

Penultimately, there's the issue of scriptless script, and ZK's reaching full composability, which means eventually dapps won't even require L1's or their tokens which will only serve the middleman/middleware purpose of driving up tx costs. They'll get dumped like taxation in the Boston Harbor, and in reserves these dapps are likely to hold Bitcoin, which is what LUNA is now doing. That's how the DAO era actually begins if there ever is one.

Lastly, all s-curve adoptions have their shakeout phase. Expect coming regulation, the centralization revelations of the Ukraine war, and market forces to punish almost everything not named bitcoin, with very few exceptions.

&gt;Although the term orphan block is still commonly used to refer to those generated blocks when two miners manage to solve a block almost simultaneously. Since the network does not accept and distribute the generated block instantaneously, but rather presents a delay, it may happen that another miner solves exactly the same block. Thus two blocks are generated in a very close time, and both are distributed to the network for validation. There will be miners distributing one of the blocks and they will start solving the next block based on the hash of the received block. For their part, there will be other miners who received the other block generated first and will also begin solving the next block.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, there will come a point where a miner finds the solution to the next block based on one of those generated simultaneously. And that's when the miners will take the longest chain. That is, the block from which the next block was generated will show a greater Proof of Work (PoW) and therefore, it will be accepted within the blockchain. While the block with the least amount of PoW, it will be discarded, and therefore, it will not be added to the blockchain. These types of blocks are known as invalid or expired blocks, although they are more commonly called orphan blocks."				1647473505	{}	i0y8ymb	False	t3_tfn612	False	True	t1_i0wsta7	/r/Bitcoin/comments/tfn612/why_is_1_confirmation_not_enough/i0y8ymb/	1667039814.0	3	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj		0	[]

If you are willing to wait till you are home for your coffee, you can both have coffee and buy a hard money asset.

120	[]		StrivingPlusThriving			[]			dark	text	t2_g5t0bcoe	False	False	[]	"I agree it's narrow. This is a Reddit comment, not an encyclopedia of war and economics. When countries run out of money and supplies what happens with the war? It usually becomes more desperate and hopeless and comes to a terrible end, and then the pieces have to be picked up, economically, politically, socially, psychologically. War was around before fiat, war has persisted through fiat, and war won’t go away if fiat goes away.  
  
Lemme see if I can un-narrow the discussion . . . here's some of my understanding of the discussion so far . . .   
  
Bitcoin and War: Bitcoin means reduced incentive to go to war.   
The Bitcoin Network is an omnipresent defense system protecting the economic value of all Bitcoin for all Bitcoin holders.  
There is not a credible attack option that could completely take down the Bitcoin network. It’s decentralized nature makes it unstoppable in it’s function: to maintain an unerring and perfect and unassailable and pseudonymous ledger of transactions.  
Bitcoin is a better form of property that discourages war and violence, and encourages cooperation between individuals and between groups.  
Bitcoin neutralizes many forms of criminal activity, whether common criminals or political criminals.  
Common criminals:  
If a thief wants to take someone’s Bitcoin by armed robbery, the thief will have to gain access through the owner’s passcodes. If correctly arranged by the Bitcoin owner, the passcode can be arranged to be very, very difficult to steal.  
Political criminals  
A powerful military is a Proof-of-Potential-Violence display, and therefore an insurance policy against direct physical attack on a country.  
A powerful military requires massive amounts of resources: human, material, energy, information.  
War is one way that nation-states decide who owns major portions of property, and which countries’ interests are satisfied through negotiations.  
In common terms, a military, and war, is the globally adopted social consensus system that countries use to defend their ownership of property and protect the rights of their citizens.  
In cryptography terms, war is the globally adopted Proof-of-Work social consensus protocol that nodes (countries) use to validate the legitimate state of property and its chain of custody.  
Unlike gold, or most tangible properties, properly custodied Bitcoin can't be ""won"" in war. You kill me through warfare, you don't get my Bitcoin, because you destroy my memory where my keys were stored, or almost certainly destroy my crypto hardware wallet, or the small piece of paper where my private key was written. So...you don't get the Bitcoin. Whereas you would usually be able to easily get any gold or land I might own after killing me through warfare.  
Bitcoin means reduced incentive to go to war. You won't get my properly custodied Bitcoin if you kill me with standard military force or go to war with my country.  
How do countries fund their war effort? To pay the soldiers and buy them uniforms and rifles and ammo, etc....war is expensive. Often they pay for it, directly or indirectly, with debt and a currency printing press. Under a Bitcoin standard that's much harder to do.  
Will there still be wars? Of course, war is not going away. Hate and fear will still exist. But they will be smaller wars and won’t last as long, for the simple reason that governments will be forced to engender cooperation with their own citizens and with other governments, instead of taking property from neighbors and antagonizing citizens and other countries. Working together will become a much more lucrative and fruitful option, versus war and destruction."				1647480207	{}	i0ynuuq	False	t3_tfkgw8	False	False	t1_i0y6pg9	/r/Bitcoin/comments/tfkgw8/what_does_this_mean/i0ynuuq/	1667099614.0	2	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj		0	[]

That is obviously why 1% of the population ends up owning 99% of all assets.

The true nature of law is that it is axiomatic. The law must be discovered and cannot invented.

As long as people accept the invention of new laws, they will continue to remain the **victims of their own false beliefs**.

Either we do what we're doing now or we increase stakers reward to cancel the shock, which means it provides extreme pressure to stake (because profit would go to 8 times what it's now for stakers; eight! ) and thus... well, induce a shock yet again. 

So, in practice, the shock has actually been induced a long time ago, when deciding that miners wouldn't get frequent mining reward reductions. Halvings. 

The only way to have no shock, as of right now, would be to keep PoW for many, many more years and get halvings, until we have enough halvings for enough time that it reduces mining rewards down to an eighth of what it is now (so, three halvings).

The terminology in general is beyond fucked, and I feel like this renaming has made things even more confusing, because now people are referring to the roadmap by the name of a network layer.

To put it simply, Ethereum is becoming a modular cryptocurrency network. Current Ethereum, as well as almost all other cryptocurrency networks, are monolithic in design; that is, the one chain is responsible for consensus, execution and data storage for the entire network.

Ethereum is splitting the network up into three distinct layers, with each layer being given the responsibilities listed above:
- The consensus layer, comprised of the beacon chain. The beacon chain acts as the backbone of the post-merge Ethereum network, and is responsible for coordinating and securing everything going on within the post-merge Ethereum network, hence it being referred to as the consensus layer.
- The execution layer, comprised of the mainnet chain, the chain we're currently using. The mainnet chain is responsible for executing transactions and storing user accounts and smart contracts, and will be connected to the beacon chain to become the first canonical shard of the post-merge Ethereum network, hence being indirectly secured by PoS through the beacon chain.
- The data layer, comprised of a number of data-only shard chains. These shard chains will only be able to store raw data, essentially offering mass data storage to the execution layer, and will be connected to the beacon chain as subsequent shards, hence being indirectly secured by PoS through the beacon chain, much like the execution layer.

By splitting the network up, each layer can be optimised specifically for its own responsibility, which streamlines the upgrade process and makes things way more efficient.

Prior to this ""Eth 2.0, Consensus Layer"" rename, the first two layers were referred to as Eth2 and Eth1 respectively, but this obviously added to the confusion as the consensus layer shared the same name with the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap, which is why it was renamed to the consensus layer."				1647478892	{}	i0ykx6p	False	t3_tfj636	False	False	t1_i0yec6k	/r/ethereum/comments/tfj636/no_more_eth20_but_wait_not_what_you_might_think/i0ykx6p/	1667088540.0	12	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m		0	[]

Yet that's exactly what the 51% attack enables. Having 51% of the hashrate ensures very effectively you can mine blocks faster than everyone else combined.

&gt;The real censorship threat is regulatory and PoS makes that significantly worse by consolidating stake into the centralized exchanges that have to abide by regulations and blacklists.

Regulatory isn't a threat to a decentralized blockchain, because decentralization first requires being non coerceable. If regulation can coerce any blockchain, it's not a decentralized blockchain anyway, because it's not censorship resistant anyway. 

&gt;It's well known that exchanges have blacklists of addresses that they have to seize funds from. Its not a far stretch to imagine the govt insisting that coinbase or kraken not include transactions from the blacklisted addresses in the blocks that they produce.

Sure. Only means you're forbidden to use some centralized exchanges. Not the matter. 

Besides, if these stakers are censoring, thus being malevolent, you can always slash them away and do without them. You're just completely ignoring the very defense mechanisms PoS relies on.

&gt;Now imagine in a PoW world Putin

No need to imagine it, since China has already providing a real world example.

Right now, there's two separate blockchains running in parallel: the current mainnet chain, and the beacon chain. The mainnet chain is what's storing everything within the Ethereum ecosystem right now, and the beacon chain stores information about all other chains connected to it.

The merge quite literally just entails dropping PoW from the equation, and connecting the mainnet chain to the beacon chain. The mainnet chain still exists, but now the beacon chain will have information about it, and the beacon chain will be securing it, rather than it being secured by PoW.

Everything that currently exists on mainnet will remain, and mainnet will be able to support everything it currently does.

Because I disagree with the logic behind their decision in their article.

Great. As I said, if they want to write closed source software, that's their right to do. However, that doesn't mean that I have to agree with their reasoning or not mention the problems I see in it, especially in the DeFi space.

&gt;I still agree that there are reasons to keep aspects closed until the right moment.

My comment didn't argue against this. I only argued against the specific points, which, in brief, were:

* The dangers of competition springing up if code is made available
* Security implications of bad actors having access to the code
* Why I think the audits aren't an alternative to code access
* How closed source DeFi is very problematic in my eyes

&gt;Honestly hubble is an awesome lending and borrowing platform

Cool. Like I said, I am unfamiliar with them and know nothing about them. I am not making a value judgement about them or their software, only on the logic provided for their decision in this one post.
