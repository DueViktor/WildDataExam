As with all things I do I try my best and whether it’s wrong or right is up to the market to decide. The question I have is then how do we create order within the Interchain with out law?

The primary purpose of these papers is to show that if nothing is done and we continue in disunion the Interchain won’t be able to function efficiently or effectually. The ideas here are a direct result of my knowledge thus far on political science. I do acknowledge my bias in my prelude. But really the point is not to have people use the system of governance I propose. Instead to realize the advantages and disadvantages of union and disunion. 

To your second point I do explain this in the constitution. 

Third: I’m thankful for your input on the anarchy definition. The false dichotomy issue you bring up is interesting. I agree but lack of central authority has never prevented rulers from domination. More so, regulation is necessary for healthy social contracts… with out it the contract the people entered falls back into the state of nature. There is no way to decide on how to regulate the Interchain without central systems for debate. Organic rules need to be agreed on in some way by the whole community.


This idea of me not knowing any better could be the case. Yet I do feel some importance towards proposing the idea all the same. For the reason to make the people of the Interchain consciously choose a side, yes or no. Whether what I claim is wrong or right, essentially that the Interchain with out some form of union regulating it will fail, is not in my hands. 

Maybe you find this idea dangerous because we so passionately and publicly disdain government in crypto. Then hopefully the paper helped you come to your decision of no. 

For me, mine is yes to Union but maybe my thoughts on how to go about it are distasteful. Which is okay. I’m okay with failing and learning.

My guess is that it has to do with how BTC is valued. “BTC’s use cases derive from its value; ETH’s value derives from its use cases”. 

For ETH, the more the merrier. Other chains? Bridges? DeFi with wrapped tokens? Come on in!

For BTC, it needs to stand alone at the top of the heap. Or so the perception is. I actually think BTC on a DeFi platform like ETH is worth more than BTC on its own, and there could be an endgame where BTC exists as wBTC on Ethereum, and doesn’t run its own L1 any longer. That seems far-fetched right now but BTC will eventually face the need for a hard fork, and they famously hate to hard fork. If it’s no longer economical to mine the thing to the extent that’s being done now, they might get their security from another chain.

Instead, most flash loans can only be used by their owner, because they're tied to their own data. For instance, most flash loans are used to get a very temporary loan that helps you repay a loan that helps you take back full control over the collateral that was securing that loan, from which you can then repay the flash loan and its tiny borrowing fee.

That's notably how you can repay an overcollateralized loan when you don't have the funds to pay for it upfront and the platform doesn't allow to repay using the collateral (or you just don't want to sell the collateral, for instance because you don't want to trigger a taxable event from the sale).

Financial attacks in flash loans are rather complex and generally require you have some funds somewhere and that you have CeFi addresses already properly set to allow for a very quick exit. Miners wouldn't like to front run that, because that would settle them for quite obvious criminal activities.

PoW staking benefits economies of scale. Meaning that a single user who fired up a GPU has an effectively 0% chance of participating in producing a block. That is why most miners are part of a larger miner group, which pools resources under the control of a single entity.

PoS does not benefit from economies of scale. Meaning that each of your 200 validators have the exact same chance of producing a slot as my single validator.

I don't need 32 eth to participate in staking, there are plenty of staking pools where I can participate without having a full node.

The government would have to buy enough ethereum to control 51% (probably more) of the network which would need to be bought. That is close to 4 million ethereum.
