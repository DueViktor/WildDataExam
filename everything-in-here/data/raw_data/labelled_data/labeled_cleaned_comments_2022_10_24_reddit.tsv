1. Do I hold BTC, and does that amount tend to increase over time? Yes.

2a. Do I make payments on the Bitcoin network, a revolutionary permissionless peer-to-peer electronic payment network with no trusted 3rd party, that provides for final settlement way faster than ACH or Visa, and also provides strong privacy when used properly?  Yes.  

2b. Do I tend to make payments on this superior network with more frequency over time?  Yes.

3. Might I spend enough BTC on something some day such that the BTC in my reserves that I am holding actually goes down?  Not now, but perhaps in the future if I want to retire and have my home paid off, am financially healthy and want to pay for my kid‚Äôs college, etc.  You never know what the future may bring.

We made this mistake at first, trusted the utility, and they rug pulled us. In order to get fixed pricing, you need to buy futures or have a PPA with the gen. Not many other ways to make it happen, unless behind the meter and self-generating.

But then, even making security audits with all the security audit teams and companies accross the world are secure enough.

So, you're probably right: it means now isn't the time for you to invest your assets in such kind of lockable features. You probably already know this, but making investments you're comfortable with is extremely important in order to ensure you always are confident enough about it, so as to avoid FUD driven decisions.

And even then, it's not the goal of regulation to ""see the light"" or even to agree with the benefits of decentralization. To centralized regulations, decentralization has absolutely no benefit. Rather, it's a liability, because it forces assets and actors to fairly compete between each others it goes opposite to their goals. On top of it, regulators have to justify their wages, which necessarily come from them doing something, notably enforcement.

rETH however is backed by actual ETH. It's non-custodial, all automated by smart contracts. Currently 1 rETH = 1.04 ETH, which means every rETH you holds entitles you to 1.04 ETH in the pool and this value grows a bit more every single day. It's fully collateralized by every node operator's ETH as well as some more RPL tokens on top.

Your wallet touches tornado cash and some cex may block you from sending your money back to the exchanges to actually use the money or send it to your bank. You could probably send it to a new address, and then another new address, then you can send it back.

The way to control Ethereum is to ideally own 51% but realistically you need 65% (pooma, read it on another post). So now you have to have tons of money to control ETH, and no amount of technological advancements in mining gears is gonna change that. Think quantum computers.

Now onto the money part, 65% right? It's a lot of money and some people may have that amount, and while Ethereum's supply is limitless, there's probably not enough to be bought on exchanges. And it won't give you the same price for each, buying that amount at once would sharply rise the price. That limitless supply has to be made and isn't available for purchase at the moment (or probably ever), you can't throw money at minting. New supply goes to stakers, making it more secure. With self limiting and burning supply, the paradigm is reversed. Eth would drop if not enough people bought it, but now it will rise if not enough people sell it. Rising price and limiting supply make it difficult to achieve this sort of attack.

Current vulnerabilities come from Coinbase staking, it holds a large share of staked ETH. This will change once unstaking is allowed, I have my test transaction done and my hardware wallet ready.

This is your own opinion. Are you part of the SEC? If not, then your opinion is as worthless as any other in the matter. 

Besides, it doesn't answer at all to my argument regarding how it would most probably be solved, just like it did last time with ShapeShift. 

&gt;It's a fairly accepted point it would most likely be classed as a security if it came to it.

Fallacy of appeal to the crowd, claiming without any supporting argument that your opinion is a most commonly accepted opinion. 

Besides, the opinion of the masses still doesn't matter anyway regarding whether an asset is considered or not as a security: there will be no referendum about it, in case you were wondering.

299	[]	False		edmundedgar			[]		reality.eth	dark	text	t2_b8j29	False	False	"TBF I think there are currently two things that are particularly bad on Ethereum right now:

1) The setup with the lead player in MEV extraction being a censoring US corporation means that a lot of stakers are censoring blocks when they wouldn't otherwise choose to. Censoring blocks isn't new or devastatingly damaging, but it probably is happening more than it would otherwise be.

2) A large proportion of stakers have decided to delegate their stake to US companies, and in particular registered US financial institutions. This makes the path to an attack involving censoring blocks much simpler and shorter than it would otherwise be. Such an attack is still very unlikely, but I think it's currently less unlikely than - say - regulating mining farms to force them to use censoring pools. 

Neither of these things are *fundamental* issues with PoS and they'll probably fix themselves on their own; PoS also has much better defences than PoW if a block-censoring attack does happen, which makes it much more secure in the long term. 

There's definitely a lot of FUD going on, especially by conflating issues (1) and (2), (1) being something that's actually happening but isn't very serious, and (2) being serious but highly unlikely. But I don't think it's FUD that the current situation with Ethereum is both currently worse and more dangerous than it's been before, and also worse than most other chains right now."	04f673cf6967fe45b50a73863df8eaabe4238a4a	True	False					0	1666567982		0	{}	itiv9mg	False	t3_ybjllf	False	True	t1_itiay4b	/r/ethereum/comments/ybjllf/censorship_fud_or_real_problem/itiv9mg/	1666567998	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]			tbf i think there are currently two things that are particularly bad on ethereum right now 1 the setup with the lead player in mev extraction being a censoring us corporation means that a lot of stakers are censoring blocks when they wouldn t otherwise choose to censoring blocks isn t new or devastatingly damaging but it probably is happening more than it would otherwise be 2 a large proportion of stakers have decided to delegate their stake to us companies and in particular registered us financial institutions this makes the path to an attack involving censoring blocks much simpler and shorter than it would otherwise be such an attack is still very unlikely but i think it s currently less unlikely than say regulating mining farms to force them to use censoring pools neither of these things are fundamental issues with pos and they ll probably fix themselves on their own pos also has much better defences than pow if a block censoring attack does happen which makes it much more secure in the long term there s definitely a lot of fud going on especially by conflating issues 1 and 2 1 being something that s actually happening but isn t very serious and 2 being serious but highly unlikely but i don t think it s fud that the current situation with ethereum is both currently worse and more dangerous than it s been before and also worse than most other chains right now 	0.0024785532150417566	0.9881554841995239	0.9265760779380798	0.019977714866399765	0.9942209720611572	0.29103192687034607	0.06002553552389145	8.474724495499686e-07	0.5021695494651794	0.016148850321769714

Making such very easily disproven claim hurts your point. Securities are either registered or claimed illegal securities being challenged in court. And rETH follows none of either case, so you're largely basing your whole point on your expectations rather than on reality.

The US also tried to come after ShapeShift, which was handled by a company, because it didn't comply with KYC regulations. The company entirely released the product decentrally, which still doesn't comply with KYC at all. This is reality, not your expectations.

There is no reason to believe people who devoted their efforts into creating a decentralized community of validators would suddenly try to enforce centralized regulations on it. Most probably, if forced to release their product, RocketPool would do so and would ask for retroactive funding of their work to Gitcoin if no other avenue to fund their work fails.

Completely false. They have public bounties, just as well as Ethereum core. This is pure misinformation from your part.

That's precisely what's protecting Ethereum core. If you don't understand the level of security public bounties offer, it's not too late to learn about it.

There was censorship occurring on Ethereum under PoW, the transition to PoS didn't change anything (the timing is just poor, the Tornado sanctions were only about a month before The Merge, so people are confusing them).

And most other blockchains are just as vulnerable to this same censorship. Bitcoin miners have censored the chain in the past, and most other blockchains could be censored in exactly the same way.

The only true solution to this censorship is base-layer privacy like ZCash or Monero.

&gt; Bitcoin's PoW algorithm makes it really cheap for anyone to spin up and run an individual node, so there's currently ~14,650 nodes running right now.

You (and the CNBC writer) are confusing mining nodes with non-mining nodes. Nothing about Bitcoin's mining algorithm makes it cheaper or more expensive to spin up and run a non-mining node - it only matters if you run a *mining* node.

There may be 14,650 total nodes, but only a small fraction of those are mining nodes (the majority are non-mining nodes), and an even smaller fraction of those make up 51% of Bitcoin's hash rate (which is the hash rate required to disrupt the network, as per the Nakamoto coefficient definition). Bitcoin's hash rate is concentrated in relatively few data centers operating with cheap electricity and ties to mining hardware manufacturers. It's next to impossible nowadays for an individual to spin up and run a profitable *mining* node.

&gt; Either way, no project is anywhere close to Bitcoin.

You're overstating Bitcoin's decentralization and understating Ethereum's decentralization. Bitcoin may be more decentralized than Ethereum, even quite a bit more decentralized, but a nakamoto coefficient of 7,000 to 3 is totally disingenuous. Bitcoin's real coefficient is unknowable due to the opacity of Bitcoin mining pools, but it's likely 15 at the very most. Even if we take at face value that Ethereum has a coefficient of 3, that's 15-to-3, a far cry from 7000-to-3.

In other words, Bitcoin is not more than 2000 times more decentralized by nakamoto coefficient - that's poppycock.

&gt; This article has more information how it's computed and (somewhat) recent numbers

CNBC's cryptocurrency coverage is actually braindead, written by someone who obviously has no knowledge of how blockchain consensus works, doesn't explain how they've calculated their numbers, seems to make the obvious newbie mistake of not properly weighting mining nodes by hash rate in their 51% attack estimate for the nakamoto coefficient, and doesn't cite any sources."	15c6e30542acd9588fe23c97a3dbba75b1f9259b	True	False					0	1666568792		0	{}	itix132	False	t3_ybj1cn	False	True	t1_itigx8i	/r/solana/comments/ybj1cn/i_dont_think_solana_gets_enough_credit_for_how/itix132/	1666568806	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]			no sir you re the one who is confused about terms gt bitcoin s pow algorithm makes it really cheap for anyone to spin up and run an individual node so there s currently 14 650 nodes running right now you and the cnbc writer are confusing mining nodes with non mining nodes nothing about bitcoin s mining algorithm makes it cheaper or more expensive to spin up and run a non mining node it only matters if you run a mining node there may be 14 650 total nodes but only a small fraction of those are mining nodes the majority are non mining nodes and an even smaller fraction of those make up 51 of bitcoin s hash rate which is the hash rate required to disrupt the network as per the nakamoto coefficient definition bitcoin s hash rate is concentrated in relatively few data centers operating with cheap electricity and ties to mining hardware manufacturers it s next to impossible nowadays for an individual to spin up and run a profitable mining node gt either way no project is anywhere close to bitcoin you re overstating bitcoin s decentralization and understating ethereum s decentralization bitcoin may be more decentralized than ethereum even quite a bit more decentralized but a nakamoto coefficient of 7 000 to 3 is totally disingenuous bitcoin s real coefficient is unknowable due to the opacity of bitcoin mining pools but it s likely 15 at the very most even if we take at face value that ethereum has a coefficient of 3 that s 15 to 3 a far cry from 7000 to 3 in other words bitcoin is not more than 2000 times more decentralized by nakamoto coefficient that s poppycock gt this article has more information how it s computed and somewhat recent numbers cnbc s cryptocurrency coverage is actually braindead written by someone who obviously has no knowledge of how blockchain consensus works doesn t explain how they ve calculated their numbers seems to make the obvious newbie mistake of not properly weighting mining nodes by hash rate in their 51 attack estimate for the nakamoto coefficient and doesn t cite any sources 	0.0027781135868281126	0.9876506924629211	0.7671336531639099	0.0785796195268631	0.008631650358438492	0.27203047275543213	0.11536955833435059	8.469634735774889e-07	0.5034174919128418	0.004163436125963926
