VISA and others will have to evolve and renew or they will die."	please stop comparing bitcoin to visa i keep seeing people argue against bitcoin based on the fact that visa can process 24 000 transactions per second bitcoin obviously does a lot less and hence the argument is that it doesn t scale and is useless as a means of payment there are so many things wrong with that comparison but i ll point out the two most obvious problems visa doesn t actually settle transaction but merely approve them promising payment some time in the future money doesn t magically leave my bank account when i swipe my card bitcoin actually offers final settlement that s a huge difference bitcoin provides a layer 1 solution offering unparalleled security and decentralization scalability does not happen at this level it s like comparing visa to bank wire transfers however look at the lightning network which preserves the security and decentralization of the bitcoin network while providing unprecedented scale the lightning network can easily handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per second for practically free visa charges merchants a 2 fee imagine how much money a big company could save if they ditched the card companies and just interested with lightning instead visa and others will have to evolve and renew or they will die 	0.003088932717218995	0.9886449575424194	0.08143368363380432	0.0688338503241539	0.008307387121021748	0.27374517917633057	0.07190418243408203	8.468455234833527e-07	0.23772422969341278	0.07249141484498978

&gt; The International Monetary Fund is pushing El Salvador to ditch bitcoin as legal tender, according to a statement released on Tuesday.
&gt; 
&gt; IMF directors “stressed that there are large risks associated with the use of bitcoin on financial stability, financial integrity, and consumer protection, as well as the associated fiscal contingent liabilities.”
&gt; 
&gt; The report, which was published after bilateral talks with El Salvador, went on to “urge” authorities to narrow the scope of its bitcoin law by removing bitcoin’s status as legal money. In September 2021, the Central American nation became the world’s first country to adopt the cryptocurrency as legal tender, alongside the U.S. dollar.
&gt; 
&gt; Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele — who has tethered his political fate to the success of the country’s bitcoin experiment — has added hundreds of bitcoin to the country’s balance sheet in recent months. On Friday, the president tweeted that he bought an additional $15 million of “really cheap” bitcoin.

Crypto has awakened a revolution in the human realm. Not only it is a place where new wealth is created, it is also where new hopes, visions and ideas emerged within the mission of bettering humanity. Essentially, what crypto brings is the expansion of equal opportunities to all human beings. Through decentralized, permissionless and trustless protocols, crypto offers us a choice and therefore the freedom to decide how we might want to live our life. It is this that makes crypto valuable and at the same time makes the opportunity for wealth here so great.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Reality of Crypto Investing**

Yet in the minds of many, this wealth opportunity is not permanent and should be treated hastily and impulsively. In phases of overt hypes and excitement, people often suffer from the fear of missing out on what they think is their only chance of ever getting rich. But most people didn’t just want to get rich, they wanted to get rich fast. This is when we see people’s appetite for risk increase. They overinvest with money they can not afford to lose, opt-in for riskier assets, borrow capitals they don’t have and begin trading with leverage, all in the hope of “making it” in the shortest period as possible.

This exuberance of impatience is what causes much of the irrationality seen in this market, We view crypto no more than ups or downs, green days or red days. We measure the success of a project based on the gains and losses instead of any real progress or concrete fundamentals. We became narrow-minded with our black and white perspectives on the space as a whole. We scream just as loud when the market goes up as it is when going down. We create unrealistic expectations in euphoric moments only to spread unnecessary fears when we enter dispair. We become the victims of our emotions, and not only does it hurt our ability to invest safely and soundly, it also hurts the credibility and the authenticity of the cryptoverse.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Culture of Crypto**

A big reason for what we are observing is the results of the culture we created in crypto. There is an extreme obsession with price in this space. It is said to be what facilitates adoption and awareness yet the reality is the large majority of price-inducing attention and interest are cheap and valueless. Some might say it is a reflection of growth and progression but this is a misconception. In crypto, fundamentals do not dictate prices. It may justify it, however, it is mainly market sentiments that drive prices, to levels that no one could ever expect or imagine, both to the upside and the downside.

The current culture of crypto does not concern with genuine adoption and things such as network effect. The game everybody is playing is predicting and speculating on how high or how low or how long, or how short these periods of hypes and pains are. The focus is on loading up bags at the very bottom and dumping them at the very top. For most individuals, this is how you win the crypto game, and it is this mentality that causes the mass to views crypto no more than a casino, a zero-sum game, and to utter things such as “decentralization does not matter”.

These are the perspectives oversaturated in the space today. People who hold these narrowed mindsets speaks no different than corrupted politicians and acts no different than the banks and corporations we wish to detach from the old system. They see themselves as the center of the cryptoverse and judge the success of the space based on how much it can profit them. These are the same people who would never try to understand crypto or do not believe in what it stands for and subsequently, they are the one who would intoxicate this space with nonsense and hopiums that benefits nobody but themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Harsh Truth For Crypto Investors**

The honest truth is the majority of us do not deserve to be in crypto. Most of us are here to take from this space rather than giving. Most of us are here to consume instead of to create. Most of us are here for the hypes, to then turn cold when tough times come by. The matter of fact is we never value the things that are being built and are being given in this space. We never wanted the freedom in finding opportunities and in building wealth. All we wanted is the securities, the guarantee to get rich. All we wanted is to be told what to invest and how to invest. All we wanted is the magic pill that makes us successful without ever failings.

The majority of us don’t even want real innovation, we want more memecoins, more ponzinomics and more forked yield farms. We want easy money without taking much risk, and often when things don’t go our way, we don’t even take responsibility for our actions. There is always something or someone to blame, and if we can not resolve our frustration and failures, we turn against the space with hatred and bitterness to the leaders, to the communities, and to the future of crypto itself.

This is the reality of most market participants in the cryptoverse, especially during market downturns, where all eyes are fixated on the same number that is influenced by the least reliable and least rational factor called human emotions. Those who fail are those who often subject themselves to emotional thinking influenced by the mass. In contrast, those who succeed are those who can detach themselves from the irrationality of the market, and more importantly, the irrationality of they themselves. Yet it is easier said than done when you are a human, who is ingrained with fears and desires. So how do you “make it” here?

&amp;#x200B;

**Finding Success in Crypto**

By directing your focus on the objective reality, the progression, the bigger picture; by learning, exploring, involving and developing a deep conviction in something; by trusting the process, trusting the visions and trusting the leadership of those who wish to bring the best to the future of humanity. How you succeed in crypto is dependent entirely on you and your capacity to remains here for a long period of time, through both sunshine and rainy days, good and tough times. How you win here is a matter of how you look towards the future of crypto and what it can bring to all of us.

Without a reason to hold on to your investment, you will deem to lose hope and fail. Without a strong belief, you will become just another victim of the dishonest and the deceitful in this market. Diving deep into the world of crypto, you will find there is so much noise here. You will be drowned in the sea of human emotions, ready to engulf you in projection and expectations that are meant to impel you into bad decisions. But it isn’t your job to change the culture that exists in crypto. It is your responsibility to filter out the noise here and be in charge of your investment and your own financial future.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR; Conclusion**

There is a saying “ you don’t deserve 500% gains if you can’t handle 50% lost in crypto”, likewise, you do not deserve the success in crypto if you can’t build yourself up to handle the nature of this market. Understand that crypto is no heaven. It is not a place to save you from the misery of your own reality, nor it was never meant to satisfy your thirst for wealth. Crypto was made for humanity and for the collective. Perhaps with this realization, you will find a grip of where you stand in this space, and by adjusting your mindset and your investment thesis, you will ultimately come out on top as someone who is brave enough to take risks, while patient enough to reap the rewards.

**Introduction: The Opportunities in The Cryptoverse**

Crypto has awakened a revolution in the human realm. Not only it is a place where new wealth is created, it is also where new hopes, visions and ideas emerged within the mission of bettering humanity. Essentially, what crypto brings is the expansion of equal opportunities to all human beings. Through decentralized, permissionless and trustless protocols, crypto offers us a choice and therefore the freedom to decide how we might want to live our life. It is this that makes crypto valuable and at the same time makes the opportunity for wealth here so great.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Reality of Crypto Investing**

Yet in the minds of many, this wealth opportunity is not permanent and should be treated hastily and impulsively. In phases of overt hypes and excitement, people often suffer from the fear of missing out on what they think is their only chance of ever getting rich. But most people didn’t just want to get rich, they wanted to get rich fast. This is when we see people’s appetite for risk increase. They overinvest with money they can not afford to lose, opt-in for riskier assets, borrow capitals they don’t have and begin trading with leverage, all in the hope of “making it” in the shortest period as possible.

This exuberance of impatience is what causes much of the irrationality seen in this market, We view crypto no more than ups or downs, green days or red days. We measure the success of a project based on the gains and losses instead of any real progress or concrete fundamentals. We became narrow-minded with our black and white perspectives on the space as a whole. We scream just as loud when the market goes up as it is when going down. We create unrealistic expectations in euphoric moments only to spread unnecessary fears when we enter dispair. We become the victims of our emotions, and not only does it hurt our ability to invest safely and soundly, it also hurts the credibility and the authenticity of the cryptoverse.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Culture of Crypto**

A big reason for what we are observing is the results of the culture we created in crypto. There is an extreme obsession with price in this space. It is said to be what facilitates adoption and awareness yet the reality is the large majority of price-inducing attention and interest are cheap and valueless. Some might say it is a reflection of growth and progression but this is a misconception. In crypto, fundamentals do not dictate prices. It may justify it, however, it is mainly market sentiments that drive prices, to levels that no one could ever expect or imagine, both to the upside and the downside.

The current culture of crypto does not concern with genuine adoption and things such as network effect. The game everybody is playing is predicting and speculating on how high or how low or how long, or how short these periods of hypes and pains are. The focus is on loading up bags at the very bottom and dumping them at the very top. For most individuals, this is how you win the crypto game, and it is this mentality that causes the mass to views crypto no more than a casino, a zero-sum game, and to utter things such as “decentralization does not matter”.

These are the perspectives oversaturated in the space today. People who hold these narrowed mindsets speaks no different than corrupted politicians and acts no different than the banks and corporations we wish to detach from the old system. They see themselves as the center of the cryptoverse and judge the success of the space based on how much it can profit them. These are the same people who would never try to understand crypto or do not believe in what it stands for and subsequently, they are the one who would intoxicate this space with nonsense and hopiums that benefits nobody but themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Harsh Truth For Crypto Investors**

The honest truth is the majority of us do not deserve to be in crypto. Most of us are here to take from this space rather than giving. Most of us are here to consume instead of to create. Most of us are here for the hypes, to then turn cold when tough times come by. The matter of fact is we never value the things that are being built and are being given in this space. We never wanted the freedom in finding opportunities and in building wealth. All we wanted is the securities, the guarantee to get rich. All we wanted is to be told what to invest and how to invest. All we wanted is the magic pill that makes us successful without ever failings.

The majority of us don’t even want real innovation, we want more memecoins, more ponzinomics and more forked yield farms. We want easy money without taking much risk, and often when things don’t go our way, we don’t even take responsibility for our actions.

If you look at the source above, the debt of El Salvador is about half of its GDP.  That is reasonable for a wealthy country, but for a relatively poor country it is quite meaningful.  If El Salvador cannot get a loan from the free market (you guys for example), they will have to get it from the IMF.  The IMF has its rules for how a nation is allowed to conduct itself and one of them is that speculating on unproven assets (even if brilliant) is not allowed.

Firstly, I would like to appreciate your time for reading this post. I know, many of you will likely laugh from it, but despite that I've decide to create it. What for, you may ask. The answer is simple - maybe I still searching for a miracle in this *mad* world. That's what I always repeat this to my beloved ones, to believe.

I am definitely sure everyone heard an expression ""Every little helps"". Even a little thing can change a life of person upside down. Even 1BTC can help my family to see a better life. To get a house, the most important place for each family.

Looking deeply, I don't have a power to ask you for help. You have a power to 'give' or power to 'create a miracle', but I can only share my thoughts and hope for your understanding, kindness and mercy.

Today I find myself thinking that every day surprise me more &amp; more about what happening in the world. A women who got rich, selling her fart in the can for 1k$, a teenager who sold a crisp (one crisp!!!) for 20k, a girl who got 1kk for her topless photos in less than one day.... What's wrong with this world?

I'm just a normal person, who used to work hard from morning till evening for more than 15 years. Sometimes taking the second and a third job, till I have energy to do it. Living from salary to salary to support a family. Doing a job, which saves people's lives from a terrible disease, but in the same time, which is not giving anything to live on. Not to buy a house or even to save for deposit, not to take family for a holidays they dream about...

I'm not a rogue or steal something from someone and never think about it. I'm just a normal person, who tries hard to survive in this mad world and keep do his best to save people's lives.

If any of  you understand me and want to create a miracle for me and my family, I'm attaching my btc wallet here...   bc1q3fasxy8ra5mxrpk5czxctv0px7ej3a6wd8mw35

Bitcoin was my first purchase, but I bought even alt-coins. 

I took the same approach to crypto as I had originally taken to stocks: trying to pick the next best thing. However, I had abandoned that strategy with stocks earlier in 2021. 

What I learned with stocks was that I’m not a good stock-picker, nor do I want to be. The amount of time, energy and stress to do that are simply not worth it. So I just resigned to “buying the whole market” in the form of total market index fund (VTI). I slept much better from then on. 

Now comes crypto where that’s not really possible. So I tried to diversify into loads of different projects… what a mistaken that was!

I realized that I was essentially doing the same thing as chasing stocks. The more I learn(ed) about Bitcoin the more I see that alt-coins are at best a derivative of BTC, a cheap imitation at worst. 

I’ve never sold any of my BTC, and I never felt the urge to even when it reached $69k. However, I did liquidate all my alt-coins and I don’t miss them at all, and with this dip I finally reached a whole coin which feels amazing! 

I don’t know if this makes sense to anyone else, but for me, holding BTC is easy and feels similar to holding a total market index fund in equities because I never feel tempted to sell or trade it since it’s such a valuable asset. Selling all the alt-coins and moving into BTC felt just like when I sold all my stocks and moved into VTI, like a huge weight lifted off my shoulders.

As you know today at about 03:30PM ET the Fed (the Central bank of United States) is going to have a meeting with regard the interest rates in US. This is an important decision, which is sure to have price repercussions across markets. Current rumors (in the media) point that likely Fed will **increase** the interest rates in order to curb the rampant inflation in the US (currently: **7%**) and stabilize the effects of the massive money printing which started with the COVID-19 recovery programs.

**US inflation (2021-2022):**

Historically, whenever Fed lowers interest rates, the stock market goes up. And whenever Fed increases interest rates, the stock market goes down (and of course, sometimes the market does not react so directly to the interest rate adjustments, as there are many other factors too).

**My personal analysis/opinion:** Fed will increase rates today. BTC (and the crypto market in general) will suffer for about a week or two, but then it will continue its recovery (since more and more people are stashing away money to crypto in general). You can see this trend by analyzing the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization (which is constantly increasing).

My (best) translation of the part about Satoshi:

This mindset shift of the orange pilled life has really struck a chord where the cat is out and not going back in. When I first held btc and it pumped, I Immediately thought of the fiat value, what new things I could buy with my gains, and cashed some out. Now I see things priced in BTC and selling my investments in my early twenties is a cardinal sin and will allocate future income in discretionary ways, opposed to spending the capital I have now.

Doing accounting in BTC terms strikes me as a huge shift in thinking, recognition that the gold standard and hard money doesn't discourage spending, but discourages wasteful spending and incentivizes getting real return out of money spent.

Inflationary environments have complex mechanisms that obfuscate costs. The consumer is placated by CPI (cheap pizza and youtube) while assets continue to not be held for no real reason other than a lack of education and exploitation of the fact by capital owners; who can afford to do things like war to control supply chains, while the wage slaves drive the boats and work the fields for an ever decreasing nominal income.

A couple things have become quite clear. The fed will likely never be audited and the debt cycle they've created will lead to a revolution. Our digital lives will likely make this a quiet, slow, peaceful brain drain to fiscally responsible societies that reinvest in their population while cesspool exploitative practices will drive away those who see through it.

According to this theory, this is what happens when 1. prices are stable (or deflating), 2. when prices are incresing:  

1. Prices are stable and reach an equilibrium that persists for several decades. This phase was marked by material progress, cultural confidence, optimism about the future and “enlarged ideas of human dignity, freedom and the rule of law.” The beginnings of the upward price movement emerge due to accelerated population growth and/or rising living standards. Prices of services and manufactured goods tend to lag behind, which “improves the lot of the ordinary people.” The price equilibrium sees real wages rise, but returns on land and capital fall. Inequalities in income and wealth begin to lessen. Families grow stronger, crime rates fall, drug consumption declines, wars become less frequent and less violent, while births outside marriage decline. 
2. People begin to see inflation as a long-term trend and an “inexorable condition.” People adapt to expanding money supply and rising velocity of circulation. Price inflation becomes increasingly institutionalised and more systemic. Inflation takes hold with prices rising and becoming highly volatile and unstable. Severe price shocks are experienced in commodity markets accompanied by rapid expansion and contraction in money supply. The financial markets become increasingly shaky. Government debt rises as expenditures exceed revenues. Wages lag behind prices, while returns on land and capital increases. This results in severe wealth and income inequalities. Social distress increases in line with rising hunger, homelessness, crime, homicide, births outside marriage, drug and alcohol abuse, family disruption and so forth. People lose faith in institutions and there is a desperate search for spiritual values. The price revolution peaks and then collapses resulting in demographic declines, economic breakdown, political revolutions, wars and social violence.

I apreciate feedback from historians and also more book suggestions. Thanks!"

Realistically bitcoin only needs to reach its previous ath within 10 years to beat an estimated stock market return.

Adding in 2 more halvening cycles within this 10 year period and still having 0% growth past the previous ath seems highly unrealistic.

Got a few houses (small landlord here), and have both bought and sold real estate over the years, so this wasn't my first rodeo.  But it was my first time to sell a house and have this much frustration getting my funds for available use.  So I signed all the paperwork at the Title Company, and they gave me my check, and I didn't really look at the check all that hard, and it turns out it was not a cashier's check but a normal, regular 3rd party check.  So I took the check to my bank (Wells Fargo), and the cashier tells me it will take 2 days for it to be made available.  Two days!  

The buyer gets to go into my house the moment I signed the final paperwork and gave him the keys.  But...I have to wait 2 full stinkin days to get to use my funds???  The cashier said ""Well, the first $400 will actually be available now, but the remainder customarily takes 2 days.  That's our policy.""  Wow, well, nice of them to let me use $400 right off the bat, huh?  I explained to her that it's a closing check from a title company, she said no matter, all checks are handled this way.  I asked her what my options are to get the funds available immediately, she said go get cash itself, or a cashier's check. 

So I went to the bank the check was drawn on (Hancock Bank), and asked to cash it.  They said they don't have that much cash on hand (it was $120k, the check), I'd have to drive to their main branch which was a 40 minute drive.  I said ok, and drove it.  The cashier there called the issuer of the check, the Title Company owner, but it kept going to his voicemail.  She said she couldn't cash it until she confirmed with him.  So I called his office, apparently he had gone to lunch and his secretary couldn't get a hold of him.  I waited at the bank about 40 minutes and never got a hold of him, so I gave up and headed back toward my bank.  I decided to stop at his office and give it one more chance of finding him to ask for a cashier's check, but his office was closed and locked now!  Apparently he was not coming back from lunch and the secretary had left and locked things up (yeah, the most unprofessional thing I've seen in a long time).  So now it was getting later into the afternoon and I went back to my bank and just deposited the stupid check.  I couldn't get a hold of the guy, and didn't want to push it off to the next day and it end up being 3 days before I could even use my funds.  

I went home.  Before long the guy calls me back finally, I tell him the whole story, he's apologizing up and down, I said don't worry about it but can we fix it.  He said yeah, meet me at Wells Fargo in half an hour (right before they closed).  We met there, he brought a cashier's check this time and said he put a stop payment on the original check (which was pending in my account).  So, the lady at Wells Fargo explained that the stop payment would cause the first check to bounce eventually, and the funds would come back out along with a fee of $12.  I said ok, whatever, sure I'll pay 12 bucks, just let's get me my funds available.  So I deposited the cashier's check, and then found out it would take until midnight that night!!! 

So all that work and driving and waiting and a $12 fee, to get my funds literally 18 hours earlier.  I can't express my level of frustration at the whole thing.  Past closings have always been paid by wire transfer, which while it wouldn't hit my account until like 2-3 hours after I'd signed the paperwork and turned the keys over, at least I got use of the funds that same day.  This was a MISERABLE EXPERIENCE!!!!  I will never allow a Title Company to give me anything but an IMMEDIATE wire transfer, going forward.  Ever.  Or Bitcoin.

The entire time I kept thinking ""Bitcoin solves this....Bitcoin solves ALL of this....OMG Bitcoin...."""	true story about banks made me cry out for bitcoin so softly closed on a house yesterday i m the seller got a few houses small landlord here and have both bought and sold real estate over the years so this wasn t my first rodeo but it was my first time to sell a house and have this much frustration getting my funds for available use so i signed all the paperwork at the title company and they gave me my check and i didn t really look at the check all that hard and it turns out it was not a cashier s check but a normal regular 3rd party check so i took the check to my bank wells fargo and the cashier tells me it will take 2 days for it to be made available two days the buyer gets to go into my house the moment i signed the final paperwork and gave him the keys but i have to wait 2 full stinkin days to get to use my funds the cashier said well the first 400 will actually be available now but the remainder customarily takes 2 days that s our policy wow well nice of them to let me use 400 right off the bat huh i explained to her that it s a closing check from a title company she said no matter all checks are handled this way i asked her what my options are to get the funds available immediately she said go get cash itself or a cashier s check so i went to the bank the check was drawn on hancock bank and asked to cash it they said they don t have that much cash on hand it was 120k the check i d have to drive to their main branch which was a 40 minute drive i said ok and drove it the cashier there called the issuer of the check the title company owner but it kept going to his voicemail she said she couldn t cash it until she confirmed with him so i called his office apparently he had gone to lunch and his secretary couldn t get a hold of him i waited at the bank about 40 minutes and never got a hold of him so i gave up and headed back toward my bank i decided to stop at his office and give it one more chance of finding him to ask for a cashier s check but his office was closed and locked now apparently he was not coming back from lunch and the secretary had left and locked things up yeah the most unprofessional thing i ve seen in a long time so now it was getting later into the afternoon and i went back to my bank and just deposited the stupid check i couldn t get a hold of the guy and didn t want to push it off to the next day and it end up being 3 days before i could even use my funds i went home before long the guy calls me back finally i tell him the whole story he s apologizing up and down i said don t worry about it but can we fix it he said yeah meet me at wells fargo in half an hour right before they closed we met there he brought a cashier s check this time and said he put a stop payment on the original check which was pending in my account so the lady at wells fargo explained that the stop payment would cause the first check to bounce eventually and the funds would come back out along with a fee of 12 i said ok whatever sure i ll pay 12 bucks just let s get me my funds available so i deposited the cashier s check and then found out it would take until midnight that night so all that work and driving and waiting and a 12 fee to get my funds literally 18 hours earlier i can t express my level of frustration at the whole thing past closings have always been paid by wire transfer which while it wouldn t hit my account until like 2 3 hours after i d signed the paperwork and turned the keys over at least i got use of the funds that same day this was a miserable experience i will never allow a title company to give me anything but an immediate wire transfer going forward ever or bitcoin the entire time i kept thinking bitcoin solves this bitcoin solves all of this omg bitcoin 	0.0007702253060415387	0.9952784776687622	0.48877882957458496	0.007909413427114487	0.9973005652427673	0.9992533326148987	0.13362650573253632	8.387133902942878e-07	0.21223871409893036	0.0001409962569596246

Included in the America COMPETES Act just introduced in the House, and which will very likely pass in some form, is a provision that would be disastrous not just for bitcoin but for privacy and due process generally. 

https://preview.redd.it/yd6ndzcdr2e81.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f30615c6ce3bb070f5d57d6b9c1e70591efdde1

 The so-called ""special measures"" provision would essentially give the Treasury Secretary unchecked and unilateral power to ban exchanges and other financial institutions from engaging in cryptocurrency transactions. How would it do this? 

https://preview.redd.it/oe75dflgr2e81.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc361154d9da4c892574720e50f0dc4368375cc0

Bank Secrecy Act §5318A allows the Secretary to identify a ""primary money laundering concern"" and take ""special measures"" to (1) require financial institutions to report information on the concern, and/or (2) prohibit FIs from maintaining accounts related to the concern. 

 ""Special measures"" authority is vast power that the Secretary of the Treasury has today, so in the current statute there are checks on that power. 

First, the law requires that Treasury engage in a public rulemaking before instituting a prohibition. Second, the secretary can impose a surveillance special measure through a simple order, but its duration is limited to 120 days and must be accompanied by a public rulemaking. 

 While not full due process, these limitations at least alert the public and gives the public some opportunity to comment on a special measure's merit or constitutionality. 

 The new provision would do three things:  -Add ""certain transmittal of funds"" to the list of things that can be banned by the Secretary  -Eliminate all public notice and comment requirements  -Eliminate the 120-day limitation for measures imposed without regulation 

&amp;#x200B;

 If adopted into law, this provision would be disaster not just for crypto but for privacy and democratic public process related to \*all\* types of financial transactions. 

 It empowers the Secretary to prohibit any (or indeed all) cryptocurrency transactions (or any other kind of transaction) without any process, rulemaking, or limitation on the duration of the prohibition.

 After alerting folks in the House and Senate of that amendment's unintended consequences, it was removed from the final bill that passed. Unfortunately it's back verbatim without any improvements. 

 It still strips out \*all\* administrative process and duration limitations on the Secretary’s power to condition or prohibit transactions at financial institutions associated with primary money laundering concerns.

^(Jerry Brito:)

Included in the America COMPETES Act just introduced in the House, and which will very likely pass in some form, is a provision that would be disastrous not just for bitcoin but for privacy and due process generally. 

https://preview.redd.it/yd6ndzcdr2e81.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f30615c6ce3bb070f5d57d6b9c1e70591efdde1

 The so-called ""special measures"" provision would essentially give the Treasury Secretary unchecked and unilateral power to ban exchanges and other financial institutions from engaging in cryptocurrency transactions. How would it do this? 

https://preview.redd.it/oe75dflgr2e81.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc361154d9da4c892574720e50f0dc4368375cc0

Bank Secrecy Act §5318A allows the Secretary to identify a ""primary money laundering concern"" and take ""special measures"" to (1) require financial institutions to report information on the concern, and/or (2) prohibit FIs from maintaining accounts related to the concern. 

 ""Special measures"" authority is vast power that the Secretary of the Treasury has today, so in the current statute there are checks on that power. 

First, the law requires that Treasury engage in a public rulemaking before instituting a prohibition. Second, the secretary can impose a surveillance special measure through a simple order, but its duration is limited to 120 days and must be accompanied by a public rulemaking. 

 While not full due process, these limitations at least alert the public and gives the public some opportunity to comment on a special measure's merit or constitutionality. 

 The new provision would do three things:  -Add ""certain transmittal of funds"" to the list of things that can be banned by the Secretary  -Eliminate all public notice and comment requirements  -Eliminate the 120-day limitation for measures imposed without regulation 

&amp;#x200B;

 If adopted into law, this provision would be disaster not just for crypto but for privacy and democratic public process related to \*all\* types of financial transactions. 

 It empowers the Secretary to prohibit any (or indeed all) cryptocurrency transactions (or any other kind of transaction) without any process, rulemaking, or limitation on the duration of the prohibition. 

 This provision was first introduced as an amendment to the national Defense Authorization Act last year

How could a person move BTC that was purchased from a Bitcoin terminal to a mixing service?

Would you advise against storing mixed and unmixed BTC between different addresses linked to the same hardware wallet? My understanding is that all of the BTC linked to one's hardware wallet should either be mixed or unmixed, and getting it mixed is best practice.
