Halvings occur every 4 years.  There was one in 2012, 2016, 2020 and one coming up in 2024.  The current amount of BTC issued to miners is 900 BTC daily.

&amp;nbsp;

Why does this matter?  Because miners sell BTC to cover expenses for mining.  And this creates daily selling pressure on BTC.  

&amp;nbsp;

But why would 900 BTC affect anything when the total supply of BTC is over 19 million?  Specially considering miners don’t sell every bitcoin they earn.

&amp;nbsp;

I would argue that the 900 BTC should not be compared to the total supply but instead to the daily on chain volume.  If most BTC is in cold storage or not being actively traded, it doesnt come into play when considering the market supply and demand on a daily basis.  What matters more is how much BTC is being actively exchanged on chain. And that number is closer to 250,000 BTC on average per day.

&amp;nbsp;

So if miners are selling 75% of the 900 BTC they earn per day, that is 675 BTC being sold daily.  That is 0.0027 of the daily average  volume. 

&amp;nbsp:

So what?  Well that selling pressure is daily, so per week that selling pressure becomes 0.0189 of an average days volume.  Per month its 0.081 and per year its 0.9855.  Almost a whole days average volume of selling pressure.  But is one days worth of volume out of 365 days in a year a lot?  

&amp;nbsp;

Put another way, if miners sell 675 of the 900 BTC issued daily, that is $14 million in selling pressure at current prices.  As price increases, that selling pressure increases.  When BTC is at $60k, the selling pressure becomes $40 million daily.  That means currently, $14 million worth of BTC must be purchased daily to keep a price level stable.  And when BTC was at $60k, it meant $40 million had to be purchased daily just to prevent a price drop, let alone an increase.

&amp;nbsp;

So the amount of BTC issued per day looks minuscule by volume standards but when you look at the actual amount that must be purchased daily to maintain a given price, not even taking into account any other daily selling pressure, you can see that the halvings do matter."

Fedi Inc. on Tuesday announced that it had raised $4.2 million in a seed round as the company seeks to onboard more users onto Bitcoin with the Fedi app, per a statement sent to Bitcoin Magazine.

The application, which the company expects to begin rolling out in Q1 2023, will provide a user interface for Fedimint, an open-source protocol that leverages federated Chaumian Ecash mints to decentralize bitcoin custody and enhance the scaling capabilities of the currency.

“Fedi and Fedimint will help put monetary power back into the hands of everyone, everywhere,” said Fedi Inc. co-founder and CEO, Obi Nwosu, in a statement. “This creates brighter futures for billions and especially for those struggling under oppressive regimes, which ultimately makes the world a better place.”

“Citadel Dispatch” episode 70, “Using Lightning Privately With Tony And FuturePaul“:

&gt;Tony:  
“There’s a fine line between educating and being doom and gloom. People need to be educated that it’s not perfect and there’s a lot of holes in Lightning privacy and Bitcoin privacy as well. It’s not a lost cause. I like to tow the line between breaking privacy and fixing privacy. Breaking privacy to educate people that it is kind of broken and you need to be careful. But then also trying to educate and make it better at the same time. The reason I do this is so we can get privacy to be better.”  
Matt:  
“To fix problems you need to be aware of problems first.”

pLN is a new wallet project that Tony and futurepaul are working on that aims to make it easy for users to follow the “happy path” of making payments *privately* on the Lightning Network.

I'm helping a friend recover a very old seed (Summer 2012). There's likely no coins on it, and if there are it's not many, but it's more of a challenge kind of thing.

Here's the situation (what he can remember, which is not much): 

1. He generated a seed or wallet or password using something he can't remember (we suspect it might have been a [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) password, or an electrum seed, mostly based on the date), of unknown length. He remembers having had to select an address from a list of addresses, which sounds more like an electrum thing than a [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) thing.
2. He then generated a list of 100 words (not sure where he got the words), and ""hid"" the key in those words. We know they were kept in order, but do not know if they were kept adjacent (his best recollection is they were not).

At one point we suspected [bitaddress.org](https://bitaddress.org), but looking at the date of his 100 words file, it was created \*right\* before bitaddress supported specifying one's words (versus just random keys)

I'm writing tools for him to bruteforce possible solutions/combinations, but any information I could get about what would be ""possible"" at the time, would be helpful.

We found the javascript for wallet/key generation of [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) using [archive.org](https://archive.org). [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) has several lists (v2, v3, v4), and at that time, using the page generated seeds that only used ""v2"" words (all words generated are always in the v2 list). However, his 100 words list contains some words that are from the v2 list, and some that are not, seemingly randomly (there is no convenient 12-v2-words-in-a-row series in the data, unfortunately).

How would I go about finding the Summer 2012 list of words for electrum (has it changed since or would the current one be good?), to do the same sort of analysis.

Aside from [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) and electrum, is there any other candidate for what he could have used to generate his seed/key?

We can't figure out how he generated the 100 words, any hints of any tools back at that time that would have done it for him?

Any ideas of how to make progress on this?

(any help that participates in solving the puzzle will result in a small crypto reward from my pocket, no matter if the wallet contains coins or not).

Thanks!

(no PM contact obviously. also, my friend won't share the list of words even with me, so you have no hope of getting it from me...)"	 treasure hunt help with a very old scambled seed hello everybody i m helping a friend recover a very old seed summer 2012 there s likely no coins on it and if there are it s not many but it s more of a challenge kind of thing here s the situation what he can remember which is not much 1 he generated a seed or wallet or password using something he can t remember we suspect it might have been a blockchain com https blockchain com password or an electrum seed mostly based on the date of unknown length he remembers having had to select an address from a list of addresses which sounds more like an electrum thing than a blockchain com https blockchain com thing 2 he then generated a list of 100 words not sure where he got the words and hid the key in those words we know they were kept in order but do not know if they were kept adjacent his best recollection is they were not at one point we suspected bitaddress org https bitaddress org but looking at the date of his 100 words file it was created right before bitaddress supported specifying one s words versus just random keys i m writing tools for him to bruteforce possible solutions combinations but any information i could get about what would be possible at the time would be helpful we found the javascript for wallet key generation of blockchain com https blockchain com using archive org https archive org blockchain com https blockchain com has several lists v2 v3 v4 and at that time using the page generated seeds that only used v2 words all words generated are always in the v2 list however his 100 words list contains some words that are from the v2 list and some that are not seemingly randomly there is no convenient 12 v2 words in a row series in the data unfortunately how would i go about finding the summer 2012 list of words for electrum has it changed since or would the current one be good to do the same sort of analysis aside from blockchain com https blockchain com and electrum is there any other candidate for what he could have used to generate his seed key we can t figure out how he generated the 100 words any hints of any tools back at that time that would have done it for him any ideas of how to make progress on this any help that participates in solving the puzzle will result in a small crypto reward from my pocket no matter if the wallet contains coins or not thanks no pm contact obviously also my friend won t share the list of words even with me so you have no hope of getting it from me 	0.0024793846532702446	0.9892336130142212	0.22580434381961823	0.013981699012219906	0.007950151339173317	0.5605005025863647	0.06309588998556137	8.055749844970705e-07	0.14220060408115387	0.03976845741271973

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Regarding **emission**, I strongly doubt that that was a very big topic when the switch to proof of stake was first introduced in 2014/2015. (Feel free to correct me). So I'm quite confident **this can't be the main initial reason for the switch.**

While I'm not entirely convinced PoS is a more secure model than PoW (feel free to convince me), I think **security is a fair debate to have.** I understand that the different models have different risks and arguments could be made both ways. But there is no definite answer, so I also doubt this would be a very strong primary reason to switch to PoS.

So basically the main initial reason HAS to be scaling, right?. But when you look at the facts, after the merge Ethereum will hardly have a better scaling than the proof of work protocol. Its not until other scaling solutions like Sharding, Rollups, Sidechains etc. will be introduced that there is a true difference. But, these scaling solutions are not necessarily connected to the PoS model**. Couldn't these solutions also be possible with a PoW model?**

**So what are the REAL initial reasons to move to PoS, as decided in 2013/2014?**

Very curious to your answers, I'm definitely open to be convinced.

For this purpose, I won’t be using complicated and complex technical words as a lot of people didn’t understand them.

I’ll be using more of a “laymen’s terms” kind of explanation just to help people understand what zkEVM is/does before they personally dive into technicals

(Would love to make another post that dives deep into technical terms and explanations if you guys demand one).

&amp;#x200B;

So let’s start!  
We first have to understand

# - What is a rollup?

There are two ways to scale Ethereum.  
(Channels or Sidechains)

Channels are full secured by Ethereum however they work well for only a very specific set of applications.

Sidechains on the other hand can scale general purpose applications however they are less secure than layer 2 solutions as they don’t rely on the security of Ethereum but rather on their own consensus model.

Rollups (the vast majority of them) can achieve the best of what Channels and Sidechains have to offer while eliminating the drawbacks that come along with them by creating a general purpose scaling solutions while still full relying on Ethereum’s security.

&amp;#x200B;

# - What is zero-knowledge (ZK)?

A zero-knowledge rollup (as the name implies) offers users a lot more privacy when doing transactions. The way the technology is built allows validators to prove that “yes this transaction is legit and true” without having to disclose private or sensitive information to said validators.

To make it simple I’ll give out a fun example  
You and your friend are standing in front of two rooms. These two rooms have a connecting door from the inside but that door is protected by a code that only you know.

You want to show your friend that you know the code but you don’t want to share the code with him. Based on this, you go inside one room, close the door behind you and press the code for the connecting door which leads you to the other room, thus proving to your friend that you do indeed know the code without having to disclose the actual code for him.

Its a fun example that helps you understand why zero-knowledge is so important. It’s all about benefiting from the quickness and efficiency of rollups while also benefiting from the privacy that ZK offers.

&amp;#x200B;

# - What is EVM?

EVM is an acronym for “Ethereum Virtual Machine”. It is the software machine for the Ethereum’s network.  
EVM basically allows developers to create smart contracts using the Solidity coding language.

So why is everyone so psyched about EVM equivalence? Because it comes with huge advantages. Mainly things like compatibility with Metamask wallets, and the fact that it makes devs’ jobs much easier since they’re already familiar with Solidity

&amp;#x200B;

# - Some names to mention regarding zkEVM are (I’ll have to mention some technical words here, sorry):

zkSync and Polygon Hermez

  
Now I have to say that although zkSync has had their zkEVM testnet live for months, it is closed source which sadly defeats the entire purpose of zkEVM.

Polygon Hermez on the other hand is open source which is great for the Ethereum chain and developers.

There’s been some recent controversy regarding Polygon zkEVM being EVM-compatible and not EVM-equivalent. The main argument is that if you're a developer a few functions breaking over not being 100% equivalent may result in a dApp crashing. However, this argument is irrelevant for a simply reason.

Hermez is bytecode equivalent. They run that bytecode on their own custom zkASM.  That allows direct compatibility with existing dApps. Those dApps should run without any problem since they’re completely bytecode equivalent. This might be extra work for the nodes to put in to validate and write the block that isn't equivalent but it really shouldn’t be a problem. Main argument is that the devs can't literally copy paste their code off Ethereum, but they literally shouldn't do that anywhere, there should be always revisions when migrating contracts to make sure everything goes smoothly.  
What Polygon is doing is of great value for Ethereum and its ecosystem and devs overall.  


Phew! That might have been the longest post I’ve written but I really hope that it gives people a quick idea idea about what zkEVM is and why it’s so important for Ethereum.

Again, this was all in laymen’s terms but I’d love to follow up with a post that dives into technicalities if popular demand says so."
