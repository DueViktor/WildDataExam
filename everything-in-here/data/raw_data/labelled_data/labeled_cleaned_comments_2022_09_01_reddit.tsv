Hayek, 1984

And on that note, Frédéric Bastiat predated him

""When plunder becomes a way of life for a group of men living together in society, they create for themselves in the course of time a legal system that authorizes it and a moral code that glorifies it."" Frederic Bastiat, 1847

And since we are quoting left and right, 1988 Cryptoanarchist manifesto about NFTs.

""Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government  interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures.”

And 1992, Cypherpunk manifesto:

- ""Privacy is the power to selectively reveal 
oneself to the world.""
- ""We must defend our own privacy if we 
expect to have any.""
- ""We cannot expect governments, 
corporations or other large, faceless 
organizations to grant us privacy out of 
their benificence.""
- ""We are defending our privacy with 
cryptography, with anonymous 
mail-forwarding systems, with digital 
signatures, and with electronic money.""
- ""Our code is free for all to use, worldwide.
We don’t much care if you don’t approve of the software we write. We know that software can’t be destroyed and that a widely dispersed system can’t be

You don't need many states to coordinate. China had more than 50% of mining occurring on its own soil. 

At most, you'd probably need two states, right now. Or one state who's also seizing mining equipment directly from manufacturers. 

&gt;No legal implications at all, strictly tyrannical actions across multiple, most likely democratic, first world states to coerce miners?

What legal implication? You're talking about them trying to take control of a chain, they'd just have to say the chain has to be controlled by them and anyone who's in control of mining equipment should hand it over to the state. Anyone who doesn't comply has its equipment seized and considered criminal, because it's the law. Plain and simple. It's the state we're talking about. They are the ones defining the law. The state is the legal implication itself. 

It wouldn't even be the first time states would do such a thing, by the way. We had it with gold, already, after all.

&gt;You're talking killing people and blatant government crimes here.

Quote me saying the state would kill anyone that complies with the law. 

&gt;And it assumes that every single instance somehow works and everyone being coerced agrees to help.

No, it doesn't need to assume that in any way.

&gt;Does it seem like you're kinda just spinning up a scenario that can't plausibly happen?

It seems not, but I'm ready to let you tell me what prevents it. A Constitution? A judge? A god? A weapon?

Irrelevant. The double digit percentage in China doesn't change the fact they've arrested lots of big mining farms.

At this point, it's only a matter of time before they realize they've finally got a very stable and functional chain no one can seize. 

&gt;Don't really feel like going into a whole other convo on PoW but seems like you're using the example of essentially a metal wrench attack on miners? This theory could probably be done pretty easily to PoS validators with some easy chain analysis to identify owners. Food for thought. However I don't think either of those scenarios are realistic at all. It would require global coordination of police, gov, military, etc. And for what? To try and doublespend a transaction?

Not to double spend, to control the network, just the same as in PoS consensus attack attempts. It's the cheapest way of controlling the chain, and that cheapest way is easily doable with PoW. 

Besides, it's not hard to spot big mining farms at all. You just have to look at your electrical grid and that's it. Big electricity consumption are easy to spot. It's way harder to find validators once they know you're looking for them. The ones beforehand will have doxxed themselves, sure. But son't expect them not to be anonymous afterwards. They'll just use whatever they need to keep being anonymous. Chain analysis only works on people who don't know how to protect their data. 

And you really don't need the military to enforce laws onto people. Just some police officers are enough, just like in England. Unless we're taking about miners turning into mafia or such, but I wouldn't be expecting that. 

&gt;Realistically, any drastic attack on any network can be hard forked for repair, but it's never ideal.

No, a consensus attack on a PoW chain can't be hard forked for repair. Attackers can follow you, because you can't destroy their mining equipment. That's the very problem of PoW, besides economies of scale. 

&gt;But thinking that Ethereum is money is pretty ridiculous. It's pretty clear in the white paper that it is an application platform and never claims to be a monetary system.

It is an asset that can be used as money, just like any other asset. Just like gold. It just happens to be much easier to store, verify and transfer than gold, aka having much better properties. So, yeah, it has been designed as an asset. It can still be used as money. 

In any way, Ethereum is the network itself, the consensus of transactions. Any asset better designed to be a currency can live on it. And I fully agree with you it would be much better not to use Ethereum, the token, as money."	04a318c0c118324265940531bfb1c48b8831ea78	True	False					0	1661918472		0	{}	imhb8py	False	t3_x1tmeb	False	True	t1_imh90ic	/r/ethereum/comments/x1tmeb/friedrich_august_hayek_nobel_prize_laureate_in/imhb8py/	1661918485	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]			 gt i can t deny the network may become invulnerable but i d probably say it would be a shell of a network at that point as well with most users lost at this point it s only a matter of time before they realize they ve finally got a very stable and functional chain no one can seize gt don t really feel like going into a whole other convo on pow but seems like you re using the example of essentially a metal wrench attack on miners this theory could probably be done pretty easily to pos validators with some easy chain analysis to identify owners food for thought however i don t think either of those scenarios are realistic at all it would require global coordination of police gov military etc and for what to try and doublespend a transaction not to double spend to control the network just the same as in pos consensus attack attempts it s the cheapest way of controlling the chain and that cheapest way is easily doable with pow besides it s not hard to spot big mining farms at all you just have to look at your electrical grid and that s it big electricity consumption are easy to spot it s way harder to find validators once they know you re looking for them the ones beforehand will have doxxed themselves sure but son t expect them not to be anonymous afterwards they ll just use whatever they need to keep being anonymous chain analysis only works on people who don t know how to protect their data and you really don t need the military to enforce laws onto people just some police officers are enough just like in england unless we re taking about miners turning into mafia or such but i wouldn t be expecting that gt realistically any drastic attack on any network can be hard forked for repair but it s never ideal no a consensus attack on a pow chain can t be hard forked for repair attackers can follow you because you can t destroy their mining equipment that s the very problem of pow besides economies of scale gt but thinking that ethereum is money is pretty ridiculous it s pretty clear in the white paper that it is an application platform and never claims to be a monetary system it is an asset that can be used as money just like any other asset just like gold it just happens to be much easier to store verify and transfer than gold aka having much better properties so yeah it has been designed as an asset it can still be used as money in any way ethereum is the network itself the consensus of transactions any asset better designed to be a currency can live on it and i fully agree with you it would be much better not to use ethereum the token as money 	0.003002476878464222	0.9880760908126831	0.20778244733810425	0.028438115492463112	0.008453888818621635	0.22872090339660645	0.07219049334526062	8.486096589876979e-07	0.35618263483047485	0.009649014100432396

So yes there are ways to limit inequality and one of those ways is to limit the market. A great book on this is How China Escaped Shock Therapy. 

About consented cooperation. Is it consented if Pinochet privatized everything and now you need to work for a monopoly who has more power than you do? Is it consented if they hold healthcare over your head by allowing monopolies through deregulation. Is it consented when you could starve if you don't play by their rules. I mean all u would need to do is work at an Amazon facility for 1 week and it would be more than obvious. But I won't hold my breath. Nothing in capitalism is consented anymore. At some point when there were still commons left it was possible to opt out. Tell me how u opt out when camping on public land is prohibited and when you can't collect rain water. I mean we could go on, and capitalism creates these protections for profit."	c15b3714b8e1718cf45c5fda6a5bbab24f70498b	True	False					0	1661959147		0	{}	imj5tle	False	t3_x1tmeb	False	True	t1_imgrg5m	/r/ethereum/comments/x1tmeb/friedrich_august_hayek_nobel_prize_laureate_in/imj5tle/	1661959161	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]			reality creates inequality but capitalism exacerbates it you can see as taxes are reduced on the wealthy and corporations inequality skyrockets plenty of data on this when you deregulate the financial sector you create worse inequality and hayek ignored all of that purposely and when you do have workers in unions with co determination and more power inequality decreases which is parts of keynesianism that he explicitly ignored so yes there are ways to limit inequality and one of those ways is to limit the market a great book on this is how china escaped shock therapy about consented cooperation is it consented if pinochet privatized everything and now you need to work for a monopoly who has more power than you do is it consented if they hold healthcare over your head by allowing monopolies through deregulation is it consented when you could starve if you don t play by their rules i mean all u would need to do is work at an amazon facility for 1 week and it would be more than obvious but i won t hold my breath nothing in capitalism is consented anymore at some point when there were still commons left it was possible to opt out tell me how u opt out when camping on public land is prohibited and when you can t collect rain water i mean we could go on and capitalism creates these protections for profit 	0.0028556310571730137	0.9875952005386353	0.8094314932823181	0.018917754292488098	0.009386315010488033	0.2429070919752121	0.10459040105342865	8.333491336998122e-07	0.2446688413619995	0.0029827209655195475

Usually miner B is out of luck. But it really depends on what the miner of the next block does; they have a free choice which block to build on. This is why the newest block of any blockchain (Bitcoin included) doesn't have a high guarantee of really ending up in the blockchain.

As you said, the more blockchain technology takes hold, the more applications such as social networks or services for final users will begin to adopt the blockchain ""disguising"" it as normal 2.0 applications.

I guess that this is really the only way to make mass adoption a reality.

After that, in a few years, people will start to get to know blockchain better and not be afraid of it anymore, but for now, in my opinion, this is one of the few ways for real integration of this new technology.

1) Solend USDT/USDC borrow rates are much higher at 6-7% before liquidity mining incentives. But Solend would give you some small interest on your collateral deposit, which Hubble/Hedge do not.

2) On Hubble/Hedge you can pay back your loan and withdraw at any time, no matter what. On Solend if the pool utilization rate nears 100% (all assets are loaned out) then you may not be able to withdraw your collateral. This happened in June this year.

3) USDC/USDT are centralized stablecoins and could be subject to regulatory action such as address blacklisting or freezing of funds. There has been plenty of speculation on if Tether is really backed 1:1 or has risky commercial paper assets backing the token.

It’s unbelievable how many people out there know Solana but have no idea not only about stake pools but about the actual concept of staking.  
So in my opinion, what would really help is a lot of easy to grasp, non-scary infographics on everything related to staking:  
how validators work in terms of securing Solana and delegators’ rewards;  
what is zero risk (staking), low risk (e.g. stabilized asset DeFi), medium to high risk (volatile asset DeFi);  
a map of Solana’s liquid staking and DeFi protocols would be awesome, etc.  
So basically a lot of materials to educate newcomers curious about Solana."	346e62e6f72782fc64d2b09f35f67bcfae61e9a2	True	False					0	1661949318		0	{}	imiioeg	False	t3_wzkijx	False	False	t3_wzkijx	/r/solana/comments/wzkijx/what_else_would_you_like_to_see_in_the_subreddit/imiioeg/	1661949333	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]			i recently talked to a guy an it professional and crypto enthusiast and he asked what did i do so i was like we have a project in solana do you know solana of course i do i bought some sol a while ago still holding it then i asked if he was staking it am i what now it s unbelievable how many people out there know solana but have no idea not only about stake pools but about the actual concept of staking so in my opinion what would really help is a lot of easy to grasp non scary infographics on everything related to staking how validators work in terms of securing solana and delegators rewards what is zero risk staking low risk e g stabilized asset defi medium to high risk volatile asset defi a map of solana s liquid staking and defi protocols would be awesome etc so basically a lot of materials to educate newcomers curious about solana 	0.0008649139199405909	0.9953213334083557	0.14040116965770721	0.01789301075041294	0.0039908792823553085	0.1156056672334671	0.15906842052936554	8.480545830025221e-07	0.46816161274909973	0.00011085784353781492

Nothing is rushed, as it's simply not meant to be used as a daily driver yet, and Charles has always been clear about it and tempered people's expectations in his vids.

I've read your blog, you seem ambitious, you have the right attitude, but not really grasping the full idea of your NFT project or even what your approach is considering the lack of an established community. 

You're twitter has followers which is a good sign, considering it's now been around for a year. 

I have a few couple questions:

 \- Do you already have your NFT collection or website w roadmap etc?

\- Could you explain more about your approach to this project considering you're asking for experienced partners?

You said you lack the ability to write in Rust, why exactly do you need this language in particular to your NFT venture? Are you or have been a programmer in your past?

Perhaps you should give more of a backstory to yourself. What technical knowledge you have, business experience, failed projects in the past. etc. before you try looking for partners. We all have struggles, but people here want to know your IDEAS, past, present, future, so ppl can see you're transparent, and ambitious. 

I've started an NFT project myself from zero. Still at zero. But it took me 5 months for the collection itself, design, art, scripting etc. Even in this bear market, where I do believe there is  TON of potential for REAL followers, yet it's still difficult to find the right, creative methods required to gain the critical mass necessary. IMO to grow a community, be transparent as possible with your ideas and execute small goals on a daily to weekly basis to prove legitimacy. 

I'm still interested in why you're looking for a technical cofounder for an NFT project in it's early stages. If you could right another post explaining more deeply about I would love to read it. I've started a small venture in 2014 that was a social media platform, long story short, don't make your friends without experience founders. But it sure makes for a good story years later. Lol. 

Interested to hear more from you,
