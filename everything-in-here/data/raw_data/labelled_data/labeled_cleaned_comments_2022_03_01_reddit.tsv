Those cultural delusions are strong in russian mentality. The people need to drop those patterns of thinking or they’ll just install another authocrat (they have strong respect for authocrats, crave them and despise democracy - to put it mildly: they have different view of what democracy is).

185	[]		bitcornminerguy			[]			dark	text	t2_eqypndvc	False	False	[]	"I think the BitPay card lets you spend directly off your BTC balance, but like others have said they're just converting for you, so you're not really getting ""out"" of the system, you're just removing yourself one step from it.

But that honestly may be as good as it gets right now. Until mortgage lenders, public utilities, taxing authorities, and mass retail begins accepting Bitcoin, its going to be spotty at best.

I know THIS will sound silly to some... but I'd also write a letter to the Board of Directors and/or various execs at every single one of the aforementioned places you do business with and TELL them you wish to pay in Bitcoin. They need to know that customers/constituents really want this. The more folks that make direct contact and push the issue... the more likely they are to start listening. Otherwise, they only have anecdotal evidence that some people want this and it stays off their radar even longer. We all know you may not move the needle on your own, but you'd be surprised at the same time.

Good luck!"				1646030672	{}	hyqzde6	False	t3_t31w8n	False	True	t3_t31w8n	/r/Bitcoin/comments/t31w8n/considering_going_full_bitcoin_standard_questions/hyqzde6/	1655776063.0	2	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj		0	[]															i think the bitpay card lets you spend directly off your btc balance but like others have said they re just converting for you so you re not really getting out of the system you re just removing yourself one step from it but that honestly may be as good as it gets right now until mortgage lenders public utilities taxing authorities and mass retail begins accepting bitcoin its going to be spotty at best i know this will sound silly to some but i d also write a letter to the board of directors and or various execs at every single one of the aforementioned places you do business with and tell them you wish to pay in bitcoin they need to know that customers constituents really want this the more folks that make direct contact and push the issue the more likely they are to start listening otherwise they only have anecdotal evidence that some people want this and it stays off their radar even longer we all know you may not move the needle on your own but you d be surprised at the same time good luck 	0.0026776462327688932	0.9883637428283691	0.8978520035743713	0.011765284463763237	0.00902102142572403	0.7290775179862976	0.07695253938436508	8.451513053842064e-07	0.15076398849487305	0.0444134883582592
