You (moments earlier...):

&gt; Like the lazy kid in group project trying to take all the credit for everyone else's work.

You're fundamental misunderstanding the Ethereum project.

&gt;It's counting someone else's work as your own.

Who is the 'your' in that sentence? Ethereum is the most resilient and decentralized smart contract chain, it has been built by a huge number of different people working for different teams and as individuals. Because of it's properties as the most credibly neutral, trustless and secure L1, thousands of other projects (dApps, sidechains, rollups etc) are built upon it, by different teams and individuals. All of this is 'Ethereum'.

As a perfect example, you brought up Polygon, they clearly see themselves as just a part of Ethereum, just read or listen to any Sandeep Nailwal in interviews. He even started the hashtag NAE (Never Abandoning Ethereum) and for months and months had his pinned tweet as a comment about how he couldn't imagine his life if he hadn't found Ethereum...

Ethereum mainnet's roadmap of upgrades has since about 2 years ago been almost entirely based around making the chain more useful for rollups... even though rollups are being built by different teams and, as you pointed out, don't need to pass on all revenue to L1. The rollup I'm most familiar with is Optimism, which overcharges by about 1/3 (so if you pay $0.12 for a transaction, only about $0.09 gets spent on gas fees on Ethereum mainnet), all of the profit goes to a treasury for retroactive public goods funding so that other projects that benefit the ecosystem can be built (https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c).

I know this is probably hard to understand if you're coming from a corporate controlled shitcoin like Hedera. The idea of other people just passionately joining in to build an ecosystem for reasons other than pure short term profit extraction must seem incomprehensible, as illustrated by your comments here."	9b3483140ebffe379f191744122a60daecf12b88	True	False					0	1664062787		0	{}	ips0lh5	False	t3_xn2f4o	False	True	t1_iprhpqi	/r/ethereum/comments/xn2f4o/question_about_the_100k_tps_feature_that_gets/ips0lh5/	1664062798	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		 gt and who said cheating you moments earlier gt like the lazy kid in group project trying to take all the credit for everyone else s work you re fundamental misunderstanding the ethereum project gt it s counting someone else s work as your own who is the your in that sentence ethereum is the most resilient and decentralized smart contract chain it has been built by a huge number of different people working for different teams and as individuals because of it s properties as the most credibly neutral trustless and secure l1 thousands of other projects dapps sidechains rollups etc are built upon it by different teams and individuals all of this is ethereum as a perfect example you brought up polygon they clearly see themselves as just a part of ethereum just read or listen to any sandeep nailwal in interviews he even started the hashtag nae never abandoning ethereum and for months and months had his pinned tweet as a comment about how he couldn t imagine his life if he hadn t found ethereum ethereum mainnet s roadmap of upgrades has since about 2 years ago been almost entirely based around making the chain more useful for rollups even though rollups are being built by different teams and as you pointed out don t need to pass on all revenue to l1 the rollup i m most familiar with is optimism which overcharges by about 1 3 so if you pay 0 12 for a transaction only about 0 09 gets spent on gas fees on ethereum mainnet all of the profit goes to a treasury for retroactive public goods funding so that other projects that benefit the ecosystem can be built https medium com ethereum optimism retroactive public goods funding 33c9b7d00f0c i know this is probably hard to understand if you re coming from a corporate controlled shitcoin like hedera the idea of other people just passionately joining in to build an ecosystem for reasons other than pure short term profit extraction must seem incomprehensible as illustrated by your comments here 	0.002318405080586672	0.9883710145950317	0.7113109230995178	0.015984617173671722	0.008420403115451336	0.5875334739685059	0.12070567905902863	8.484162208333146e-07	0.43272045254707336	0.002099308418110013
197	[]	False		gotificial			[]				text	t2_fdbzbu22	False	False	"&gt;Define how autonomous centralization can be decentralized, please.

Let's say there's a completely autonomous organization. They met each other on a completely equal basis. The autonomous organization begins to develop an application. In this case, the participants are assigned a division of work. In this case, each participant is put into a divided task. For example, front-end, back-end, security, and system are such tasks. When 100 people come together to create such a program, they don't write codes on their own. For example, if 25 people are assigned to each of the above four fields, there must be a team leader in each field. And a team leader for all 100 people is also needed. A leader is essential in order to conduct business in an orderly manner. This is an inevitable phenomenon for any decentralized organization. Without the leadership of the team leader, the entire project is bound to collapse.  
  
In this case, the team leader gives ""work orders"" to the team members. This is a kind of power. A kind of centralization. But all team members are still equal. The team members have no complaints. The reason why they follow the team leader's instructions is that they do not follow the team leader's power, but only follow the rationality of the team leader's instructions. The team leader also always gives reasonable instructions. There is no perverted psychology caused by any power. I define this as autonomous centralization.  
  
This phenomenon also exists in Bitcoin and Ethereum. For a node that has succeeded in mining to select TXs to be included in a block, for that moment, it is also playing the role of a team leader.  
  
Usually, a team leader is elected by agreement of the whole. However, in the case of the mainnet, i.e., a P2P organization of numerous nodes, the selection of the team leader node follows predetermined rules in the program. In other words, there is no human intervention. The method of selecting the team leader node, the tenure, authority, and summoning method are all determined on the code. This is exactly what Satoshi thought of as an ""autonomous organization without human intervention.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Also, please define how certain nodes acting as centers can avoid destroying network resilience.

The team leader node is elected from among the P2P nodes. If the current team leader node is attacked and stopped, another random or scheduled node immediately plays the role of the team leader. This process is also already specified in the code. In the case of my mainnet, about 1,000 nodes are waiting in line to become the team leader. This is because the team leader is given a corresponding reward. Therefore, compared to the current chaos caused by forks in the Bitcoin or Ethereum platform, its resilience can be said to be much better."	fa3cd0149e0b75de8d1f3b1c62a92cab730cd222	True	False					0	1664062583		0	{}	ips06c7	True	t3_xmu6bq	False	True	t1_iprg7ec	/r/ethereum/comments/xmu6bq/how_did_the_block_come_about/ips06c7/	1664062600	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		 gt define how autonomous centralization can be decentralized please let s say there s a completely autonomous organization they met each other on a completely equal basis the autonomous organization begins to develop an application in this case the participants are assigned a division of work in this case each participant is put into a divided task for example front end back end security and system are such tasks when 100 people come together to create such a program they don t write codes on their own for example if 25 people are assigned to each of the above four fields there must be a team leader in each field and a team leader for all 100 people is also needed a leader is essential in order to conduct business in an orderly manner this is an inevitable phenomenon for any decentralized organization without the leadership of the team leader the entire project is bound to collapse in this case the team leader gives work orders to the team members this is a kind of power a kind of centralization but all team members are still equal the team members have no complaints the reason why they follow the team leader s instructions is that they do not follow the team leader s power but only follow the rationality of the team leader s instructions the team leader also always gives reasonable instructions there is no perverted psychology caused by any power i define this as autonomous centralization this phenomenon also exists in bitcoin and ethereum for a node that has succeeded in mining to select txs to be included in a block for that moment it is also playing the role of a team leader usually a team leader is elected by agreement of the whole however in the case of the mainnet i e a p2p organization of numerous nodes the selection of the team leader node follows predetermined rules in the program in other words there is no human intervention the method of selecting the team leader node the tenure authority and summoning method are all determined on the code this is exactly what satoshi thought of as an autonomous organization without human intervention amp x200b gt also please define how certain nodes acting as centers can avoid destroying network resilience the team leader node is elected from among the p2p nodes if the current team leader node is attacked and stopped another random or scheduled node immediately plays the role of the team leader this process is also already specified in the code in the case of my mainnet about 1 000 nodes are waiting in line to become the team leader this is because the team leader is given a corresponding reward therefore compared to the current chaos caused by forks in the bitcoin or ethereum platform its resilience can be said to be much better 	0.002787164179608226	0.9896101951599121	0.4489514231681824	0.9538723230361938	0.007914514280855656	0.38301119208335876	0.07804491370916367	8.301595926241134e-07	0.3958158791065216	0.03316665440797806
