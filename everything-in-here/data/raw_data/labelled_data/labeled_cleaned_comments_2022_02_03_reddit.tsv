You don't get caught, so now you're making enough to either buy another two gpu or get a small solar array. What's another $160 in stolen power for $200 in profit, versus the same profit but less stolen power? It builds from there. Eventually you're stealing $2000 worth of power and making $2500/mo. It would cost you a year's profits to even come close to covering your power needs with a solar array and battery bank, so you just keep stealing power - and you've gotten away with stealing power up until now so why would you cut your profits by 80% just to be above-board? The smart people see transitioning to self-generation as a business investment - because in the long run it's far more profitable to both not pay a power bill and not have your assets seized (and/or have to pay for 12 months worth of the stolen power consumption, which is the normal penalty in Spain).

This is probably a better question for someone from Manta / Calamari. =) Although I was just playing with their Dolphin testnet yesterday, and it's very cool. I hope that they can improve their circuits enough so that the Manta Signer isn't necessary, but that will come with time I assume!

The rationale behind the minimum number of nominators and a minimum amount to stake are due to the difficulty of finding a good solution to the election set in a reasonable amount of time with Phragmen. We don't want to get rid of the Phragmen election algorithm because it provides a lot of security, as it reduces variance amongst validators (which means more DOT would be necessary to join the active set, thus making it more expensive to attack the network). Too many nominators can cause block production to drastically shut down or even cause an OOM on nodes.

Kian, one of the Parity developers, has been writing monthly updates on how he is working on updating the staking process: [https://gist.github.com/kianenigma/aa835946455b9a3f167821b9d05ba376](https://gist.github.com/kianenigma/aa835946455b9a3f167821b9d05ba376)

By stakers, I assume you mean validators. For both BABE and GRANDPA, the number of validators must be known - unlike proof of work systems, a limited number of block producers are required in a proof of stake system (although this limitation can be arbitrarily large). There are trade-offs to increasing it, however - the more validators, the longer it takes to come to a consensus, for instance, and the less amount of staking rewards each validator gets. 

All that said, \_anyone\_ can attempt to change these parameters by issuing a governance proposal. There have been very heated debates in the past about increasing or decreasing the maximum number of validators in the active set (scroll through Polkassembly for some examples, e.g. [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/155](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/155) on Kusama and [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/29](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/29) on Polkadot). The staking limits can be set by proposing staking.setStakingLimits with the new parameters.

The majority of stake can \_always\_ command the network. If DOT / KSM holders feel that the benefits of increasing these numbers against the advice of the relevant engineers, they can do it."	bf6cce21d098dabdb9d1bf634098efcd041d370f	True	False					0	1643809022		0	{}	hv9v6ms	True	t3_shuo2j	False	True	t1_hv4qsce	/r/Polkadot/comments/shuo2j/bill_laboon_ama_2_feb_building_on_polkadot/hv9v6ms/	1643809040	1	False	True	False	Polkadot	t5_2ublt	r/Polkadot	public		0	[]			this has been an ongoing issue that i ve answered in several of my amas long story short is that yes it is a shared concern and yes people are working on it the rationale behind the minimum number of nominators and a minimum amount to stake are due to the difficulty of finding a good solution to the election set in a reasonable amount of time with phragmen we don t want to get rid of the phragmen election algorithm because it provides a lot of security as it reduces variance amongst validators which means more dot would be necessary to join the active set thus making it more expensive to attack the network too many nominators can cause block production to drastically shut down or even cause an oom on nodes kian one of the parity developers has been writing monthly updates on how he is working on updating the staking process https gist github com kianenigma aa835946455b9a3f167821b9d05ba376 https gist github com kianenigma aa835946455b9a3f167821b9d05ba376 by stakers i assume you mean validators for both babe and grandpa the number of validators must be known unlike proof of work systems a limited number of block producers are required in a proof of stake system although this limitation can be arbitrarily large there are trade offs to increasing it however the more validators the longer it takes to come to a consensus for instance and the less amount of staking rewards each validator gets all that said anyone can attempt to change these parameters by issuing a governance proposal there have been very heated debates in the past about increasing or decreasing the maximum number of validators in the active set scroll through polkassembly for some examples e g https kusama polkassembly io referendum 155 https kusama polkassembly io referendum 155 on kusama and https polkadot polkassembly io referendum 29 https polkadot polkassembly io referendum 29 on polkadot the staking limits can be set by proposing staking setstakinglimits with the new parameters the majority of stake can always command the network if dot ksm holders feel that the benefits of increasing these numbers against the advice of the relevant engineers they can do it 	0.0028299058321863413	0.9890351891517639	0.2290719598531723	0.9618446826934814	0.9940361976623535	0.4466502070426941	0.07103002816438675	7.967997248670144e-07	0.3875933587551117	0.014352530241012573
