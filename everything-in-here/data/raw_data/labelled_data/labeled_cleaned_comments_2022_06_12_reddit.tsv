When you say ""web3"" what's really going on in your head is how you're going to get suckers to exchange centralized derivative money (like stablecoins or wrapped collateral) for your shitcoin. Thankfully the entire VC shitcoin space is imploding, regulation is coming, and there won't any liquidity left for you to rob syphon.

ERC721 is the NFT gold standard. Your 721 is completely unique &amp; blockchain native. Its distributed proof of title to your digital asset and its distribution rights. The code holds several conditions to comply with transaction requirements; accordingly, transactions are slower, costly, and done one at a time.

ERC1155 is a multi-coin standard. It's gas efficient, enables entire NFT collections to fall under one contract, and most importantly, it has batch transfer capabilities missing in 721. Best of all, it saves gas. Sometimes up to 90% less. And it works as a wrap.

But to achieve this, its effectively semi-fungible. There's nothing wrong with that. Unless provenance is a central issue. ENS is more than a domain. It's anything you want it to be. It will soon be able to platform a fully featured online business with tokenized value capture.

43	[]	False		MinimalGravitas			[]				text	t2_imdxj	False	False	"That's a decent point, laziness is definitely part of the human condition and is definitely the cause of lots of people's losses in crypto.

I'm not convinced that it matters in such a big way to the crypto ecosystem in general though as you're extrapolating though. As long as some people verify 'truth' and communicate it out it doesn't need everyone too. My point was more that people who just accept their laziness as a reason to not bother are voluntarily making themselves lower tier participants, chosing to never have first access to knowledge and therefore always being behind on their investments and trades.

The one area I see where the laziness of the majority might really hurt the ecosystem is in governance. Just like in real world democracies, the reliability of the decision making process is determined by the effort the voters put into determining the best course of action. If a majority of DAO participants just click whatever the top option is on SnapShot so they can collect an 'I voted' POAP then the processes ability to determine the best course of action is nullified.

I feel like there could be a way to entice more considered decision making by voters if the process was linked in some way to something like retroactive public goods funding. If you got a little reward after a year based on whether you voted for or against a proposal that ended up having a beneficial/detrimental effect then people would have a financial incentive to invest time in trying to work out the best choices. The difficulty would be creating some kind of 'oracle' to assess the effect of a particular decision, especially as many more could have been made over a similar time period. Not sure if that is insolvable or not! 

Either way, I'm fairly confident that some method to incentivize more effort from governance participants can be found. I guess the dampner on the idea that financial incentives can encourage people to overcome their inherent laziness is that some people don't even bother to look into the projects they invest in... e.g. ""How is Anchor paying it's interest on deposits higher than the amount borrowers are paying?"" ""What happened to other undercollateralized stablecoins like Titan?""

When you want to create your own wallet, you send a transaction to the gnosis contract factory and it creates the wallet contract. They're not relying on an external organization to create the wallet, just a smart contract.

Wintermute mistakenly thought that since they controlled that address on ETH that they'd be able to control it on Optimism, which is true for external accounts (operated by keys) but not necessarily true for contract accounts.

I don't know why Gnosis would have deployed their contract to the same address on Optimism as ETH. That creates the opportunity for the same addresses to be controlled by different people on different layers, which is potentially bad, but I'm not sure it's much worse than the alternative where an address that exists on ETH can't be controlled by anybody on Optimism.

Story time:
Remember the “no demand” blitz on Tesla in 2019? All over social media, all over “news sites”. People sold Tesla shares in droves. Stock was tanking below $200 pre-splits. But if you knew Tesla, Elon, and you evaluated the Model 3 against the electric competition, and you saw the trends in societies around in world, new legislation and incentives, it was obvious there was (and was to be) extreme demand. The CEO even tweeted that there was more demand than Tesla could handle, but Armchair CEO’s on Reddit and Twitter said that it was a lie and that (without any insider knowledge) obviously there was no demand and Tesla should focus on marketing and make commercials. None of them could see Tesla’s order management system, but still was convinced the company was lying.

Finance “good to know” for the noobs:
Smart people are capable of doing their own research, while not so smart people simply listen to what others are saying and take it as fact. I guess because it’s less effort, and because you don’t have to admit to yourself that you’re not smart enough to actually understand and form an independent opinion. Everyone is supposed to be equal in todays age. Gold medals for everybody. Expect if you invest money. Because the smarter counterpart will take your money without pity.

I have just been picking up cNFTs that I feel will be there in the long run and dollar cost averaging every dip. (Referring to the broad markets) Technically we already had a chance to buy at these prices a couple weeks ago. I plan on adding to my bags the next dip. As long as you believe in the product you're buying DCA. SoL has been built for speed and they have a huge VC backing that would lose more money than us if it fails. Again I haven't bought any SOL (yet), but it may be on my list if we continue further down. We are all getting kicked around, diversification is key(real estate, stocks, crypto...etc). I'm staying very aggressive into crypto until 2025 then I'll reassess. I've been dabbling since late 2019, haven't taken any profits and DCA'd up and down. I work 2 jobs and 100% of my second job goes towards crypto. Rarely do we get a chance to invest in something that could produce life changing wealth. Keep your head up, look at crypto as a long term hold and decide let that help you decide your next move. 
Good luck solana squad, we all need our blockchains to work. Luna freaked everyone out, now ethereum is loosing blocks lol. We are all part of the crypto ecosystem and eventually we will be hoping on and off each other's BCs.

Easier options are things like ACALA or parallel finance. But neither provide the extra protection of the Ledger. I currently have a good amount staked on Ledger and about twice that amount on Parallel. I really like parallel but on the fence with security. Obviously would be best served with all of it compounding in one basket. Parallel chooses the validators for you and in my experience so far hits the 14.5% mark consistently. Plus extra on top of that with PARA rewards, etc...
