When you have a service provider, it provides service at a given cost for itself and needs to provide such service at least at such price to survive, ideally a bit more than that to have an incentive to continue providing such service. 

But, when it's a monopoly, it can ask for any price it wants, as long as customers are ready to pay for it. That's the harmful effect of monopolies, where service providers cut costs at the expense of quality and keep prices as high as customers are ready to pay, close to value for the client. 

And this effect is often observed just the same when there are only a few service providers for a given service. It's the problem of oligopolies, where service providers are few enough to collude with each others and fix their prices. 

But when there can be enough competitors, price collusion isn't possible anymore and price inevitably lowers and lowers until nearly reaching cost. Because each competitor wants to reach as many clients as possible, but still need each purchase to be profitable to them. 

And that's what's important. When you have decentralized third-parties, you're sure anyone can compete, which means it's the best possible environment for prices to be the lowest possible.

What's wrong with using Bitcoin for what it is – unstoppable internet money – as the tool to distribute those initial ETH as widely/fairly as possible? 

&gt;It’s more like a company issuing stock 

Sure, if you ignore everything that doesn't fit your analogy, it fits perfectly. The big evil preminers have ""issued"" exactly 0 ""stock"" after the blockchain launched.

&gt;Bitcoin with it’s fixed supply schedule 

Who's parameters were decided 100% arbitrarily by one guy in 2008, with no explanation ever given behind the reasoning. It's really weird that it ultimately all hinges on hoping that he magically got it right the first time when it was, all things considered, an absolutely unknown science. And y'all are completely fine with that?

and regardless, gg when most of that 21M makes it way in the hands of the ultra-rich when your world asset wet dream comes true. [Trustless in name only](https://i.imgur.com/vQoKc1E.png) when people born centuries from now barely have access to 0.01% of supply and basically have to ask them permission to participate in this blessed hyperbitcoinized economy of yours.

gg when mining rewards become so low that security turns to shit unless mining is subsidized externally (and very likely coopted by whoever's subsidizing, and then it's bye bye trustlessness even on paper) - 14 years of PoW relying **heavily** on supply inflation is absolutely not a guarantee that this will work sustainably for centuries (or even decades) without this inflation. 

&gt;and also ensures a cost in the form of time and energy to create new money

A cost that is *caused by* price movements, not the other way around. The one paying for that cost is ultimately the holder of the coin when the value of their holdings is diluted to pay miners + devalued when miners sell to cover expanses. All this talk about high cost of production meaning high value is nonsense. There's gonna be the same amount of Bitcoin issued regardless of how many people mine.

&gt;Also nothing is able to recreate Bitcoin’s immaculate conception. 

""immaculate conception"" cmon this is borderline religious lol. But you're right otherwise, can't ever be replicated. So it's pointless to compare everything to it and call everything a scam if their conception isn't as holy as Lord Satoshi's. The next best thing is what Ethereum did - leverage Bitcoin's value to distribute the initial ETH as widely as possible instead of to whoever paid the most for mining rigs to mine a huge chunk of supply at low cost. 

And guess what? Crypto is here now, and everyone is scared of the SEC and accidentally doing a securities offering. Ethereum's wide crowdsale launch *also* can't be replicated. So as far as coin distribution goes, wide crowdsale + 7 years of PoW + multiple bull/bear cycles making all that ETH swap hands + EF nearly going bankrupt that one time is as good as it gets. The big evil premine has absolutely no effect in 2022 the minute you step out of maxi fantasy land.

&gt;everything else has founders looking to get rich off of their new coin. Profit is their motivator. 

Very big cynical claim. Is it really *that* unthinkable to you that *maybe* some other people will want to try building something kinda similar but that accomplishes different goals, goals that Bitcoin has no interest in accomplishing? Actually it's worse than that, they're goals that the Bitcoin community *actively prevented* from being achieved on top of Bitcoin (see OP_RETURN)

&gt;Bitcoin also has carefully selected parameters to ensure the blockchain can remain decentralized

By using the most easily ASIC'd mining algo and refusing to ever change it to something GPU/CPU friendly so more people can participate? lol, enjoy those few big mining farms consolidating their hashrate into even fewer mining pools and being extremely easy to detect by nation states who don't want to lose the control their fiat currencies give them.

&gt;Bitcoin solves the problem of money for the world.

It solves part of the problem, but don't let yourself be fooled into thinking it magically solves all of it without any tradeoffs. How do you even begin to use Bitcoin as money in a hyperbitcoinized world where just a hundred million people opening/closing a single LN channel once a year is enough to clog the whole chain and would cost people a fortune?

Those in charge of Ethereum can and have changed it on a whim. There is a ruling class in Ethereum that forces protocol changes in often through hard forks and the threat of difficulty bombs. You either need to follow along and update, or get forked off the network. Bitcoin on the other hand has had a clear monetary policy since day one and it has never changed, and the users wouldn’t allow a fork that changes the monetary policy. Also any protocol changes to bitcoin go through plenty of back and forth within the community and are carefully implemented as soft forks whenever possible so that they are opt in.

The halvings are pretty genius too as a way to quickly introduce supply and then taper it off as adoption grows. This ensures that price will increase enough to pay miners as long as bitcoin adoption grows. The value that miners earn this halving cycle is already much more on average than last halving cycle even though the block reward is only 6.25 instead of 12.5.

Also Satoshi didn’t pre-mine anything. He publicly launched the blockchain with the genesis block (which he did mine, but the coinbase in the genesis block is unspendable) after which anyone could have joined the network and mined it.

Even today anyone can buy an ASIC and start mining bitcoin, without even owning any bitcoin first. Mining pools don’t control the network, and neither do miners in general. The users running full nodes that enforce the protocol rules do. The blocksize wars even proved this. And it’s much easier for the average user to run a Bitcoin node than an Ethereum node, especially if they have slower hardware or a low bandwidth connection.

You clearly aren’t at a level to fully understand bitcoin yet. I was there. I’d recommend researching the history of money and how goods become monetized.

If you launched a bitcoin 2.0 as an ICO, first that would make it nothing like bitcoin, but let’s say you just fork the code and make an exact copy but on a new chain, that would still be useless since it still would be bitcoin. You wouldn’t have the network effects or chain security that the real bitcoin has.

As I said, dirt pies are worthless, regardless of how much efforts you put in baking them. 

&gt;There is a reason many business people use this theory in their decision making

Indeed, it's called economic illiteracy. 

The Labor theory of value is a complete misunderstanding of economy, confusing and shifting all concepts into a big blob. Notably, it confuses ""value"" with ""market price when competition is high and free"", which makes absolutely no sense to confuse when you understand at least a bit of economy. 

&gt;because cost is the lowest possible energy they have to input to produce. Of course you need demand to produce something, but that is not a concern at all for any business man, they are not that stupid to bake dirt pies

So, you know at least a part of why the LTV makes absolutely no sense. But then, you realize that what's important is the value provided by use cases of what you produce. Cost is just the very minimum price the market can tolerate for a service to be provided, which means it's the floor value you need to reach. As long as no one gets such value, then the service is inexistent.

And then, you realize that, the lower the cost, the better the value created for society, as pushing lower and lower the cost of a product provides more and more for society, distributed among the client and the provider. 

&gt;The demand for running smart contract can also be satisfied by an ETH copy or other similar coins, so that is not a good value baseline

Nope: to have a functional ETH copy, you need to have a consensus among people investing their own value into a scarce resource, be it tokens or mining equipment or whatever. And given that such value is scarce itself, you end up realizing that the consensus is also just as scarce. And given that the quantity of computation the consensus can hold is also scarce, then you see where value comes, but also that you can't provide that value ad nauseum. 

So, what you have with an ETH copy is Ethereum just the same, except that you're to ensure people will participate into the consensus so that there's an actual service, with a stable machine state. 

You could say that we could have a third of current consensus, for instance, and lower the security accordingly to have three different chains, but that depends on ETH value, which can change, and is basically what sharding will provide anyway. So, what you're looking for, in the end, is Ethereum with all its upgrades."	235b405d7c2bfffd0d68fe849278b9b064341f3a	True	False					0	1659855428		0	{}	ija82az	False	t3_wh8z52	False	True	t1_ij9hhbs	/r/ethereum/comments/wh8z52/are_there_any_argument_for_keep_on_pow/ija82az/	1659855439	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		 gt labor theory of value the value of one product service is decided by the social average cost as i said dirt pies are worthless regardless of how much efforts you put in baking them gt there is a reason many business people use this theory in their decision making indeed it s called economic illiteracy the labor theory of value is a complete misunderstanding of economy confusing and shifting all concepts into a big blob notably it confuses value with market price when competition is high and free which makes absolutely no sense to confuse when you understand at least a bit of economy gt because cost is the lowest possible energy they have to input to produce of course you need demand to produce something but that is not a concern at all for any business man they are not that stupid to bake dirt pies so you know at least a part of why the ltv makes absolutely no sense but then you realize that what s important is the value provided by use cases of what you produce cost is just the very minimum price the market can tolerate for a service to be provided which means it s the floor value you need to reach as long as no one gets such value then the service is inexistent and then you realize that the lower the cost the better the value created for society as pushing lower and lower the cost of a product provides more and more for society distributed among the client and the provider gt the demand for running smart contract can also be satisfied by an eth copy or other similar coins so that is not a good value baseline nope to have a functional eth copy you need to have a consensus among people investing their own value into a scarce resource be it tokens or mining equipment or whatever and given that such value is scarce itself you end up realizing that the consensus is also just as scarce and given that the quantity of computation the consensus can hold is also scarce then you see where value comes but also that you can t provide that value ad nauseum so what you have with an eth copy is ethereum just the same except that you re to ensure people will participate into the consensus so that there s an actual service with a stable machine state you could say that we could have a third of current consensus for instance and lower the security accordingly to have three different chains but that depends on eth value which can change and is basically what sharding will provide anyway so what you re looking for in the end is ethereum with all its upgrades 	0.002656179014593363	0.9885231852531433	0.22608371078968048	0.9488813281059265	0.00859793834388256	0.39863020181655884	0.08318918198347092	8.465936502943805e-07	0.3638319671154022	0.004241395741701126

No it's not you, it's the fact people actually think this is a good one liner that's upsetting. But I'm constantly disappointed by the average man on a daily basis so no biggie.

I'm a 20 year back end administrator. Technical jargon is not disturbing to me. It's nonsensical jargon that is. 

Words should convey meaning. If the words can't convey meaning we shouldn't use them. Trying to force a slogan ""Turing complete"" down people's throats when it so clearly means nothing to 999999/1000000 people is absurd. I get a couple people here can Google a meaning and pretend they understand but the truth is pretty much no one knows or cares.

It's just as centralized. One could say its more decentralized since it's easier to take part in validating/mining then bitcoin.  Where Bitcoin is controlled by big mining pools and you need expensive ASICs to take part. So that is false.  

The halvings / Creation of coins on a schedule don't solve a problem. So don't see why you would name that as an argument. Actually that creates a problem with the next halving it creates enormous expense for the security of the chain. Miners get less coins so the price per coin has to rise extremely for miners to break even. Creating high sell pressure that has to be constantly absorbed.

1. Coins mined = not necessarily sell pressure. Miners can hold too, its just a different way of acquiring coins.
2. PoW networks are 90%+ of the non-stablecoin crypto market cap last I checked. It is not outdated technology. PoS is nascent technology that has yet to prove itself. 
3. Ethereum was 90% of the DeFi TVL in Jan 2021. Today, it's 58%. Many networks have started DeFi from scratch in the last year, it is not a stretch to suggest that another can do what 10 other projects have already done, especially with such a huge running start.
