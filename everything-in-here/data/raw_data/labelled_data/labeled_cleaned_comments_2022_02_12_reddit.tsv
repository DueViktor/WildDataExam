Bitcoin is not an investment

&gt; If many vendors, like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Sony do not accept my Bitcoin then how do I pay them for their product?

You pay them with money, or you boycott them in favor of vendors who accept Bitcoin  
This answer is obvious. Perhaps you meant to ask something else, or forgot to state the assumptions underlying your question

&gt; Bitcoin is explained to be anti-inflationary

A finite amount of Bitcoin will be issued. This amount is so large that being finite or ""deflationary"" is inconsequential

&gt; If Bitcoin becomes $2,000,000 a coin

Will never happen

&gt; how will fractions of a Bitcoin be determined?

Bitcoin has a sub-denomination. It only takes 5 seconds to discover this

&gt; the goal of Bitcoin?

The goal is the same as the original design, which is also the same as the current design. Before Bitcoin, centralized payment services were used as gateways in nearly all on-line transactions. As gateways, they imposed themselves as gatekeepers, deciding who can participate and which transactions are permitted. In the meat world, this baggage can be avoided by the merchant and customer choosing to use physical cash currency. Bitcoin provides an equivalent choice for on-line transactions - a payment method without a gatekeeper  

https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

&gt; Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party

&gt; Why hasn’t Satoshi Nakamoto ever come out to speak about this?

Mature people don't need to worship a leader. If you need to drool over the public announcements of your favorite CEOs, the stock market satisfies your insecurity

&gt; why can’t the blockchain be hacked?

Because there are 40,000 separate copies of the Bitcoin blockchain, each stored on a Bitcoin node, each node independently operated by a volunteer. There is no guarantee of the honesty of any single node operator, but there is no opportunity to build a 40,000-member conspiracy

&gt; If someone steals someone else’s wallet, isn’t that corruption?

there just isn't enough fiat currency for a ""cash""-in op scenario

if 1 BTC goes $10m, 1000 BTC on one wallet can theoretically pull $10B 

 that would be nice except for the fact no exchange has that amount of fiat

an exchange would have to fiat-in on their BTC reserves in order to be able to settle... which they could theoretically except for the fact nobody else has that volume of fiat either 

so trying to fiat in on ""real"" value of BTC at $10m is impossible so nobody would value it at a price impossible to settle with

the entire discussion is really off base because - even if it came to transpire - upon everyone realizing the exchanges dont have fiat volumes to back BTC settlements, that realization would send a panic throughout the market and a 'run on bank' equivalent for the exchanges, a sell off which would crash the price of BTC (dotcom bubble pop version of BTC) 

if such a thing were to transpire (and this is ALL very, very hypothetical) when the dust settles, anyone able to buy BTC at low, low, low pre-2016 prices would **cash** in on BTC - not fiat in on USD - a là eBay, google and Amazon.com analogous equivalent dotcom survivals of the BTC crash - but certainly not [pets.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com) equivalents"				1644565756	{}	hwha2h9	False	t3_spjhxz	False	True	t1_hwfwmh7	/r/Bitcoin/comments/spjhxz/bitcoins_true_value_is_somewhere_between_500k_to/hwha2h9/	1645273288.0	1	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj		0	[]		[]	text	t2_48ajc	False	False														 gt cashing in to buy bigger better things there just isn t enough fiat currency for a cash in op scenario if 1 btc goes 10m 1000 btc on one wallet can theoretically pull 10b that would be nice except for the fact no exchange has that amount of fiat an exchange would have to fiat in on their btc reserves in order to be able to settle which they could theoretically except for the fact nobody else has that volume of fiat either so trying to fiat in on real value of btc at 10m is impossible so nobody would value it at a price impossible to settle with the entire discussion is really off base because even if it came to transpire upon everyone realizing the exchanges dont have fiat volumes to back btc settlements that realization would send a panic throughout the market and a run on bank equivalent for the exchanges a sell off which would crash the price of btc dotcom bubble pop version of btc if such a thing were to transpire and this is all very very hypothetical when the dust settles anyone able to buy btc at low low low pre 2016 prices would cash in on btc not fiat in on usd a l ebay google and amazon com analogous equivalent dotcom survivals of the btc crash but certainly not pets com https en wikipedia org wiki pets com equivalents	0.0025028607342392206	0.9880504012107849	0.20668821036815643	0.020838238298892975	0.008606674149632454	0.6910915374755859	0.12998773157596588	8.533197615179233e-07	0.488273561000824	0.0006534784915857017

Look at what Block is doing with custodial and non custodial solutions among others. It's pretty much as easy to download an app and send btc to someone as it is to use Venmo.

I think we easily forget that things like the current monetary system rely on ancient tech and massive institutional intervention to function. Those have been developing over the last 100 years.

Where I think you are wrong is that what is being developed is similar to our current system. That is simply not the case. Any solution that leverages the Bitcoin network will be fundamentally different than the current system. compare the lightning network to any other payment platform. They function completely different.

I think it's really important not to lose sight of what is actually going on as far as adoption and development of bitcoin, it's supporting tech, and the fact that it's still a very new phenomenon entering a space with probably the biggest barrier to entry imaginable. It's going to take time and there is going to be a lot of noise and bad information along the way.

You can instead represent this as a decrease in money with a negative interest rate but you need to calculate the effective interest rate since 1/(1 + i) is not equal to (1 - i).

It's the third door we've never had to a system that doesn't work (Fiat). It will pave the way to the other side.  
  
**Blockchain is said to be distributed database that is shared from the computer network. If many vendors, like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Sony do not accept my Bitcoin then how do I pay them for their product?**

This is related to adoption - money goes through various forms before becoming currency. We're at store of value stage, adoption is growing, it will eventually become (hopefully) a method to transact more easily in every day life. Lightning Network will facilitate this, and we can already see this happening. More and more institutions will adopt, and we will transition to the BTC standard.

  
**Bitcoin is explained to be anti-inflationary, however if $10 trillion dollars are printed by the US Government and distributed out to people and majority of whom purchase Bitcoin, wouldn’t that automatically inflate the price of Bitcoin?**

It would increase the value of Bitcoin vs the US Dollar (and other Fiat), but the supply cannot be inflated - it is hard money. At the moment the Fed prints money and debases the $. The more it does this, the more people will save in BTC, and the more your savings increase in value. Value increases, supply doesn't. So you can ""inflate"" the price of Bitcoin by buying huge amounts, but what this really means is that it gets more purchasing power over time, whereas Fiat inflation does the opposite.  
  
**If Bitcoin becomes $2,000,000 a coin, how will fractions of a Bitcoin be determined?**

I believe it's already got 2 x lower denominations (Sats being one) built into the code, with the ability to build in more. If we had to keep on going, it's just a case of changing the code and getting consensus amongst the network - I might be slightly incorrect on this point though, so take with a pinch of salt (as with my other remarks too actually :) ).  
  
**What is the goal of Bitcoin?**

There is no real goal of Bitcoin itself - Bitcoin just exists, but what it creates is a decentralised, hard form of money, where the user can reliably store value in a medium of exchange.

**Why hasn’t Satoshi Nakamoto ever come out to speak about this?**



Not sure - but look at all of the other alt coins. There's a CEO, there's marketing. Satoshi created Bitcoin, an immaculate conception....it needs no figure head that might sway its path. The ultimate mic drop!

**Bitcoin and Blockchain is said to be the corner stone of the benefits of Bitcoin, why can’t the blockchain be hacked?**

This is a long one that I'm still educating myself about. Quick answer - because it can't :) It actually incentivises people to not hack the network, and to protect it. It's now so decentralised that the amount of energy and cooperation amongst so many different parties....just impossible.

**If someone steals someone else’s wallet, isn’t that corruption?**

Just like there are bad people and good people in the world. There are always going to be the few that ruin someone else's fun. Not sure if it's corruption....it's just shitty humans doing shitty things. Like robbing the elderly because they're vulnerable."				1644563284	{}	hwh6ood	False	t3_spsisj	False	True	t3_spsisj	/r/Bitcoin/comments/spsisj/i_want_to_understand_bitcoin_but_i_have_a_lot_of/hwh6ood/		1	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj		0	[]		[]	text	t2_eirvuhk9	False	False	False	cb5196a72ce535d213ed8d6ce0ea3c8bfa2147ff	True	False		0.0		0.0	1644563296.0	True	r/Bitcoin	public		just a couple of one liners to show this isn t a conventional investment and just purely based upon my research using resources such as jeff booth saifedean ammous greg foss james investanswers youtube why should one own a bitcoin it s the third door we ve never had to a system that doesn t work fiat it will pave the way to the other side blockchain is said to be distributed database that is shared from the computer network if many vendors like apple microsoft nvidia and sony do not accept my bitcoin then how do i pay them for their product this is related to adoption money goes through various forms before becoming currency we re at store of value stage adoption is growing it will eventually become hopefully a method to transact more easily in every day life lightning network will facilitate this and we can already see this happening more and more institutions will adopt and we will transition to the btc standard bitcoin is explained to be anti inflationary however if 10 trillion dollars are printed by the us government and distributed out to people and majority of whom purchase bitcoin wouldn t that automatically inflate the price of bitcoin it would increase the value of bitcoin vs the us dollar and other fiat but the supply cannot be inflated it is hard money at the moment the fed prints money and debases the the more it does this the more people will save in btc and the more your savings increase in value value increases supply doesn t so you can inflate the price of bitcoin by buying huge amounts but what this really means is that it gets more purchasing power over time whereas fiat inflation does the opposite if bitcoin becomes 2 000 000 a coin how will fractions of a bitcoin be determined i believe it s already got 2 x lower denominations sats being one built into the code with the ability to build in more if we had to keep on going it s just a case of changing the code and getting consensus amongst the network i might be slightly incorrect on this point though so take with a pinch of salt as with my other remarks too actually what is the goal of bitcoin there is no real goal of bitcoin itself bitcoin just exists but what it creates is a decentralised hard form of money where the user can reliably store value in a medium of exchange why hasn t satoshi nakamoto ever come out to speak about this not sure but look at all of the other alt coins there s a ceo there s marketing satoshi created bitcoin an immaculate conception it needs no figure head that might sway its path the ultimate mic drop bitcoin and blockchain is said to be the corner stone of the benefits of bitcoin why can t the blockchain be hacked this is a long one that i m still educating myself about quick answer because it can t it actually incentivises people to not hack the network and to protect it it s now so decentralised that the amount of energy and cooperation amongst so many different parties just impossible if someone steals someone else s wallet isn t that corruption just like there are bad people and good people in the world there are always going to be the few that ruin someone else s fun not sure if it s corruption it s just shitty humans doing shitty things like robbing the elderly because they re vulnerable 	0.0024880783166736364	0.9878750443458557	0.9633967876434326	0.008490516804158688	0.009177575819194317	0.9970487952232361	0.07027053833007812	8.287080959235027e-07	0.3353063464164734	0.007813607342541218

2: Bitcoin is a network that is worth way more than these companies, if they decide to compete against bitcoin , they will fail and new  companies will appear gaining traction and using this free open source network to grow.

3: It is deflationary because the prices goes up , but it is actually inflationary until it hits the last coin mined , this is why halving have a huge impact on the prices of bitcoin. so it is inflation until deflation. (in bitcoin) in usd you could say bitcoin is deflationary because the fiat inflation is way higher. 

4. P2P money of the world 

5: There is already  Satoshis, Mbtc, and more I believe , it could go forever , that's art! 

6: He probably don't have time to answer

7: If you use bitcoin how it should be used, it can't be hacked , Sha256 is used to produced a private key , this is hash , *think about ash*,every block actually your private key which hold bitcoin become stronger and stronger(security) and there's more hash over and over , so you'd have find all your *ash* in all those *ash*  and you can use an digital signature called elliptic curve which or RSA which encrypt an verify your hash. Think about this one second, to me it looks pretty secured. If you don't verify , use other people service , who knows can happen.

8: a wallet doesn't hold bitcoin, a private key does.
