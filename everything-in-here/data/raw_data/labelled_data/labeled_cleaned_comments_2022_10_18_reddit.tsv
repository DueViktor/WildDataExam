Judges don't care whether you're the direct inventor of a scam or not, just as much as they don't care whether you built a weapon to harm others or if you got it from someone else. 

The fact you scammed other people to earn their money, if it means it potentially included US citizens as victims, is more than enough. It's just that most scams end up with very few people earning at the expense of others, notably when it's Ponzi schemes and such. But you admitted it was your case, so it's then up to a
court to decide whether it agrees with you or not.

Then what does any of this have to do with crypto? Other than using your crypto as collateral and giving crypto as rewards, what makes this a crypto project/product. You could replace ""crypto"" with anything and it would be the same deal.

No, it wouldn't be the same deal, because there would be no incentive for banks or any company to provide services that cheap. 

But maybe you simply skipped that part: 

&gt;What's more efficient about crypto is that people have to compete with each others and with decentralized services. You don't get a few corporations pricing their products very far from cost, here, because they'd be outcompeted very quickly. Without crypto, these same corporations could just increase prices until meeting demand because there are too few of these corporations to ensure there's no price collusion. It also drives service quality increases to compete. 

&gt;That's how you get cold storage services being dirt cheap, video transcasting into streaming format being dirt cheap, lending and borrowing being dirt cheap, court decisions being dirt cheap, market making being dirt cheap, proven prediction markets being dirt cheap and provenly fair casino games being dirt cheap, among others.

&gt;I mean, think about an HELOC. You can get a card that works on the MasterCard network with low interest rates because you're using your home equity as collateral.

&gt;2 is the risk that your 32 ETH could be burned.

&gt;Are there any plans to simplify this process in the future?

Given that, even nowadays, we already have more than enough validators to ensure decentralization, I wouldn't see the point.

For first point, validating is more and more convenient over time. There even are easy setups for a secure Linux hardware with validators on it. Ethstaker shows these tutorials pretty often. 

As for the second point, the risk the stake could be burnt is an upside, not a downside. It's PoS, Proof of Stake. The funds being a big stake is a feature, not a bug. It's a feature that ensures even the merge went extremely smoothly with nearly no one failing to do their due diligence and update without harming the network. Most of the people who failed were people from centralized entities who were managing funds which weren't their own; and even then, only a very few people failed.

&gt;For example, you download the Ethereum wallet, press the stake button and you're done? You are not afraid that your ETH may be cut or burned.

Validators do much more than that, specifically because they have to make sure their tech is up to date. If you streamline the process so that it's all automated, you may very well end up with a unique tech stack reproduced everywhere, a unique supermajority client, a unique source of truth from where to everyone downloads updates and... then there's no resilience at all, because you end up with single points of failure everywhere. If we end up doing that, we don't have any decentralization benefit anymore. 

The average Joe wants to participate in earning from the process, nothing else. Most of the average Joe don't even know enough of validation to know whether they'd want to precisely do just that, but just want to earn something. Fortunately, they can: it's precisely why rETH exists in the first place, so that the average Joe can just buy some rETH tokens and earn from it."	c98aa99e7c949d74351d98bf50fc51d44f9b35e9	True	False					0	1665977150		0	{}	ismre8q	False	t3_y5c2pr	False	True	t3_y5c2pr	/r/ethereum/comments/y5c2pr/simple_hardware_is_not_the_only_problem_with/ismre8q/	1665977160	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]			 gt 1 is a high technical complexity to become a validator you need to be well versed in programs gt 2 is the risk that your 32 eth could be burned gt are there any plans to simplify this process in the future given that even nowadays we already have more than enough validators to ensure decentralization i wouldn t see the point for first point validating is more and more convenient over time there even are easy setups for a secure linux hardware with validators on it ethstaker shows these tutorials pretty often as for the second point the risk the stake could be burnt is an upside not a downside it s pos proof of stake the funds being a big stake is a feature not a bug it s a feature that ensures even the merge went extremely smoothly with nearly no one failing to do their due diligence and update without harming the network most of the people who failed were people from centralized entities who were managing funds which weren t their own and even then only a very few people failed gt for example you download the ethereum wallet press the stake button and you re done you are not afraid that your eth may be cut or burned validators do much more than that specifically because they have to make sure their tech is up to date if you streamline the process so that it s all automated you may very well end up with a unique tech stack reproduced everywhere a unique supermajority client a unique source of truth from where to everyone downloads updates and then there s no resilience at all because you end up with single points of failure everywhere if we end up doing that we don t have any decentralization benefit anymore the average joe wants to participate in earning from the process nothing else most of the average joe don t even know enough of validation to know whether they d want to precisely do just that but just want to earn something fortunately they can it s precisely why reth exists in the first place so that the average joe can just buy some reth tokens and earn from it 	0.0025684263091534376	0.9889060258865356	0.17866292595863342	0.9526698589324951	0.007906416431069374	0.3493843376636505	0.08198712766170502	8.032467349039507e-07	0.23203344643115997	0.010699005797505379

I believe there have only been a few instances in which a validator has been slashed (not a large percentage) and the validator may have refunded the DOT to nominators affected. If you want to minimize your risk, you can look for validators that have a significant portion of their own dot staked as they would have more to lose from being slashed.

Note that 100% slashing would only occur in the most severe case where a validator is actively trying to compromise the security of the Polkadot network.

Finally, it is possible to lose your bonded funds because the DOT is not actually stored on your hardware wallet. It exists on the blockchain. The wallet just acts a a secure private key so that you can sign transactions corresponding to your Polkadot address on the blockchain.
