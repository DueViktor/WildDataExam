The thing is, you have to ask why you put your life savings in when it was above $50k. It's a hard thing to admit, but you FOMO'd in. 

I don't say that to make you feel bad. You need to realise it so that you understand what to do next and how to handle it. It sounds like you rushed in because of greed. Most people who do that rush out because of desperation. 

Maybe BTC will go to $10k soon. It's possible. But a lot of things will crash and I believe BTC will come back better than most. We may see $50k again or maybe $100k. Who knows. It doesn't look like that will happen any time soon though. 

So why are you rushing to DCA? If you wait til you can afford to invest (which is what everyone should do), then maybe you'll get it lower. In any case, you'll probably lower that $50k average. Then, if we do see $50k again, you're in profit.

A Bitcoin halving event is when the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions is cut in half.  
This event also cuts in half Bitcoin's inflation rate and the rate at which new bitcoins enter circulation.  
Previous halvings have correlated with intense boom and bust cycles that have ended with higher prices than prior to the event.  
Bitcoin last halved on May 11, 2020, around 3 p.m. EST, resulting in a block reward of 6.25 BTC.  
The final halving will be in 2140 when the number of bitcoins in existence will reach the maximum supply of 21 million.

Story time: There was a guy who used to come into my work during the 2017 bull run. He bought into the hype and was 100% in on Bitcoin. I’m talking invested and getting paid his wage in Bitcoin. Bitcoin crashed and he lost hope but didn’t sell. Fast forward to mid 2019 and I ask him if he has been paying attention to the price of Bitcoin. He thinks I am joking so I tell him to check the price himself. On the spot he sold all the Bitcoin he had for about 10K.

If this guy would have held till 2021 he could have made a 0-350% gain at worst. Instead he made a loss.

All the miners are trying to find the hash that yields for example 0000 if not more in order to get the reward. 

So if the mining difficulty is really high right now that require a hash of 00000 (5 zeros)
Could the miners just SAVE all the hash with 4 zeros and wait till mining difficulty drops and they just run all the saved hashes and that’ll be a quick way of mining rewards?

You'll have to calculate the 24th word. Many guides online, I like this one the most: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/diy-bitcoin-private-key-project

There are easier ways like https://seedpicker.net/calculator/last-word.html but I feel like the aforementioned guide by Arman is much safer.


&gt; Ok, somehow I choose 24 words randomly from the 2048 words. How do I associate this to the blockchain, without going online?

**Everything above has to be done offline too**, so make sure to unplug the network cable or disable the WiFi. 

Anyway. Once you have the 24 words, install Electrum wallet (I like to use Tails OS on USB stick because it has preinstalled the wallet already), **make sure you're offline**, and insert your newly generated seed words in it.

If you have calculated the 24th word correctly, a wallet with addresses and keys will appear."	7c7634026f1f8079157f57e572a6b48513df0821	True	False					0	1664173115		0	{}	ipxvezs	False	t3_xnrs5v	False	True	t1_ipxjwfm	/r/Bitcoin/comments/xnrs5v/hardware_wallet_replacement_solution/ipxvezs/	1664173129	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]			 gt can you please elaborate a little more or point me to some link i flip coin 256 times and note down the result what next how does it correlate to 24 words you ll have to calculate the 24th word many guides online i like this one the most https bitcoinmagazine com culture diy bitcoin private key project there are easier ways like https seedpicker net calculator last word html but i feel like the aforementioned guide by arman is much safer gt ok somehow i choose 24 words randomly from the 2048 words how do i associate this to the blockchain without going online everything above has to be done offline too so make sure to unplug the network cable or disable the wifi anyway once you have the 24 words install electrum wallet i like to use tails os on usb stick because it has preinstalled the wallet already make sure you re offline and insert your newly generated seed words in it if you have calculated the 24th word correctly a wallet with addresses and keys will appear 	0.0028401007875800133	0.9882581830024719	0.17724432051181793	0.041117213666439056	0.008449920453131199	0.26760134100914	0.09293384104967117	8.495027259414201e-07	0.3610462546348572	0.050831012427806854

378	[]	False		boldstrategies			[]				text	t2_nuci52b	False	False	A couple of reasons 1) back in August ‘21 - January ‘22, you can make a quick $100-200 flipping an nft that you minted for 1 sol and sold for 2 sol. If you got a super hyped one like SSC or portals you minted them for 2.5ish and could’ve resold for 130 sol or 90 sol at its ATH. 2) the passive income meta was fun for a bit. SSC gave you 27ish $SHDW token/day for 365 days (plus 3000 bonus if it was consecutive days) if you staked it. I was cashing in $30-45/day. Degods in the beginning was giving you $dust and blocksmith labs aka bsl (my fave at the moment) gives you forge. In bsl ath I was getting around $30/day just for staking. Things sorta crashed around May a little after the OkayBears mint. I minted okay bears for around 2 Sol and I woke up to a floor price of 180. This shit is just fun. Holding these NFTs grants you access to their daos as well and they give what they call “alpha” and whitelists to other nft projects that are coming up which if you get the right one, you can mint them flip for profit 3) what u/righteous_mushroom said, nice shoes. I’m a hypebeast and my nft pfp is my digital flex. 4) going back to daos, there are some fun and smart people all in it to make money and have a blast.
