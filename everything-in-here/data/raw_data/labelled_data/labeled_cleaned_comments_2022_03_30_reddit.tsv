&gt;In July 2018, Sessions argued that it was unnecessary to increase federal funding for election security. The U.S. intelligence community had concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and that it was continuing to interfere in election systems as of July 2018.

Yovanovitch. In 2018, after meeting with Parnas and Fruman, Sessions authored a letter in his capacity as House Rules Committee chair calling for Yovanovitch's removal. On October 15, The Washington Post reported that the grand jury investigating the matter had issued subpoenas to Sessions, with which his spokesperson said he would cooperate.

First of all, bitcoin is global, so ""the west"" is irrelevant as long as you have no global way to enforce a local ban. The EU is so slow and incompetent that they will most likely fail to make an effective regulation. If they would manage to do something, Switzerland, Istanbul and London are less than a day's drive away from anywhere in the EU and bitcoin wallets are not linked to your identity. Even if some wallets are, creation of new wallets does not require government permission. The US has already ruled bitcoin computer code and has ruled computer code part if freedom of speech, so not sure what would be next. Mining is rynnung a (specialized) computer and connecting the intwrnet, not sure how you can ban it. If you ban a computer from running the butcoin core code, I will put up the fuckcoin core code on github, that just happens to be identical and compatible with the bitcoin protocol. Not my mistake that others use that code... Don't come with the energy argument either, you are better than that. Caputal gain taxes are already there. Not only for bitcoin. Taxes are how governments run our societies. Arguably, this might not be the most efficient way, or the way you prefer it, but this has little to do with bitcoin. Depending on your investments a lot of the CGT system relies on you honestly reporting your cap gains to the tax man. Arguably, this might not be the best system, but this has very little to do with bitcoin. In the end, more adoptuon will lead to more stability and less price fluctuations which will make cgt a moot point anyway. Wallets are computer code and decentralized. Mining equipment manufacturers are exclusively not in the west, so there's nothing they can do anyway about them.

Bitcoin is neutral. It does not care if you are a cuban immigrant sending money to your struggling family or a russian oligarch trying to hide the money he stole from the people. Bitcoin does not pick sides. You can buy food with it, you can use it in human trafficing and drugs. Much like cash...

Crashing the stock market is actually not such a bad idea. It will be an excellent way to make people choose alternative investments.

I think that they should also do all of that with real estate. They should do a yearly valuation of the house, and then send the unrealized-gains tax bill to the owner.

On the other hand, it is going to be hard, if not impossible, to do a yearly valuation of Bitcoin assets that people *hodl* by themselves. Hence, *hodlers* will be *de facto* exempt.

For crypto stored on exchanges such as Coinbase, they should indeed substract the yearly unrealized-gains tax straight from the Coinbase user's balance. The Coinbase user has no reason to complain. It's not his keys. So, it's not really his coins either.

The ruling mafia clearly needs to collect more money in taxes, and therefore, this plan should give them some extra revenue.
