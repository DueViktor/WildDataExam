The panel size is 9.6 kW, which produces 1,117 kWh/month **assuming full sun**. According to my last bill, I consume around 590 kWh within a summer month.

My monthly electrical bill is around $252.06 and the monthly cost of the Tesla system in a loan is $353.06/month for 10 years.

An S19 Pro Miner costs $5,940 to buy and yields $273.60/month assuming a 2.00% Pool Fee.

Since I have limited ""free capacity"" before I begin pulling from the grid at unprofitable rates, I can only mine for a limited amount of time per day. At 527 kWh/month of free capacity and a 3.250 kW Power requirement on the Miner, I can only mine 22.5% of the time (about 5.4 hours per day).

**How much would I make?**  
At 22.5% efficiency and revenue of $273.60/month, that's $61.56/month in mining profits. That doesn't sound like much.

**How much would the utility reimburse me for the ""free"" 527 kWh I put back into the grid each month?**  
Turns out, it's about $0.03/kWh so only $15.81/month. So definitely less than bitcoin mining. That’s great, but I spent $5,940 on the Miner.

**What’s my return on investment assuming no change in bitcoin price or mining difficulty adjustment?**  
$5,940/$61.56/month would take 8 years to pay off the Miner. 8 years is a long time in bitcoin world. 

**Wouldn’t it just be better to put that Miner investment of $5,940 in bitcoin today and secure $15.81/month in NEM?**

A supply chain would have to be okay pricing things in BTC (risky) but could sign contracts pegging the value of the product and components to the Bitcoin issuance schedule. 

For example, a barber. At Moon Months barber shop, a standard haircut is 10000 sats. It doesn't matter what the ticker says about its value in dollars. The cut is 10000 sats. 

The details are important but innumerable. And they all require each link in the supply chain to agree to transact with Bitcoin. No small feat, and not legal in most places.

Inflation, or our money divided by the will-to-print-money by governing bodies, is hard to understand because infinity is a  difficult concept to grasp. It is abstract and humans don't understand large numbers. There has been no evolutionary need for us to understand large numbers.  


An edge-less abyss is scary. The evil effect, if not indeed the evil intention, implied by the practice of systemic inflation is hard for most of us to accept and still function socially, so we choose to ignore it.

Also,  the choice between a provably scare unit of account (Bitcoin) and a provably unaccountable unit of account (Fiat) forces us to face the terrifying truth that we are responsible for giving existence meaning (rather than  the Church, etc. doing so for us) and, honestly, most of us do not wish to look beyond our sandbox-reality. We wish to be coddled.

All I mean is that it’s time to start nailing predictions to a point where people believe that you are a psychic.  

This is extremely easy just take a few seconds to let this all sink in. 

A lot of people would have guessed that the price of bitcoin would have gone above $100,000 by now.

One of the main reasons that many people would have guessed that the price would be higher is due to the fact that governments around the world have printed lots of money over the last couple of years.

Therein lies the secret to investing in bitcoin.

When the overwhelming majority believe that a certain crypto outcome is inevitable, it is never the case.

It’s usually the opposite. 

When we were in the $60,000 range, the overwhelming majority believed that we would go higher. We did not.

During the previous bear market, the overwhelming majority believed that the bear market would be shorter, and the bottom was $10,000. They were wrong, it was much longer than people anticipated, and the bottom was right around $4000. 

So what does the majority believe now? The majority of people believe that we probably have bottomed out around the most recent low.

What does this mean? Very simple. 

They are guaranteed to be wrong. We are going much lower. POTENTIALLY to zero.

Whether you’re a bitcoin speculator, or maximalist, it’s time to get right. 

All I mean is that it’s time to start nailing predictions to a point where people believe that you are a psychic.  

This is extremely easy just take a few seconds to let this all sink in. 

A lot of people would have guessed that the price of bitcoin would have gone above $100,000 by now.

One of the main reasons that many people would have guessed that the price would be higher is due to the fact that governments around the world have printed lots of money over the last couple of years.

Therein lies the secret to investing in bitcoin.

When the overwhelming majority believe that a certain crypto outcome is inevitable, it is never the case.

It’s usually the opposite. 

When we were in the $60,000 range, the overwhelming majority believed that we would go higher. We did not.

During the previous bear market, the overwhelming majority believed that the bear market would be shorter, and the bottom was $10,000. They were wrong, it was much longer than people anticipated, and the bottom was right around $4000. 

So what does the majority believe now? The majority of people believe that we probably have bottomed out around the most recent low.

What does this mean? Very simple. 

They are guaranteed to be wrong. We are going much lower. POTENTIALLY to zero.

how  many nodes you have, the chain will be censored."	please help me understand something let me apologize in advance for the poor formatting i m new to posting on reddit i was on the r cryptocurrency subreddit and came across this exchange see below in quote blocks i was under the impression that even if mining became centralized that it would still be in the best interest of the entity who controls the majority of the hash rate to protect the network as the opportunity cost to attack would be very high and thus disincentivize any attacks however if say a single entity controlled 51 of the bitcoin networks hash rate and they were located in a country very hostile to bitcoin would it be possible for the government of said country to order that entity to do nefarious things to the chain even if it s not in the financial interest of that entity amp x200b gt this is what happened in the last cycle mining just got more centralized and the big players bought the little players equipment amp x200b gt but i thought everyone in camp bitcoin said pow was the most decentralized it could be amp x200b gt no it doesn t btc s decentralization comes from the node validators not the miners gt thats a false and dangerous narrative if most hashrate comes from regulated mining corps and they are forced by the government to start censoring transactions it doesn t matter how many nodes you have the chain will be censored 	0.002257961081340909	0.9891210198402405	0.810688853263855	0.02441050484776497	0.007710153236985207	0.22185349464416504	0.0748564675450325	8.484089448757004e-07	0.45513269305229187	0.008002759888768196

Thanks"	will things get better probably the most common question here from noobies and i know probably won t get a straight forward answer but are there good reasons and evidence to assume bitcoin will recover and go to an all time high in the near future i have slowly been buying bitcoin over the past few years although i don t know much about markets or finances i just kind of hopped on the trend in the hope it was a decent investment for the future i m not expecting to become rich and expect ups and downs but just want some kind of sign that it s the right thing to do to keep investing small amounts each month thanks	0.0028508096002042294	0.9887222051620483	0.18067699670791626	0.059436406940221786	0.9941859245300293	0.3935607075691223	0.0940607339143753	8.284395107693854e-07	0.14883001148700714	0.009453563019633293

I know that addresses are supposed to star with 1bc or 3bc.

I was donating money through bitpay (who has no apparent customer service BTW) and because i use Nunchuk they did not have my wallet in their dropdown selection.

I made a donation, anyway and even though the QR code didn't scan, I used the address. 

It looked weird to me because it was not normal format. it started with

18GodPjqiRKb47.......

The payment went through. it was only meant to be $15 with $.07 in fees.

The change address is listed as having $85.70.

That is how much was charged to my wallet.

I understand that this is the cost of education but I am not sure what happened (aside from disregarding my awareness of the wonky address) and would love to know how this amount flowed out of my wallet without approval of that amount and if there is any way to block the transaction. So far there is 1 confirmation. I immediately pulled all a duplicate transaction out of my wallet with a higher transaction fee with the hopes that the double spend would beat out the first transaction and cancel out the cost of it. I read that here : [https://cryptostaunch.com/bitcoin-unconfirmed-transactions.html](https://cryptostaunch.com/bitcoin-unconfirmed-transactions.html)

Yes, i **KNOW it already exists**, actually i have a CRYPTO.COM Debit Card, but i’m not talking about exchanges, i’m talking about a decentralized debit card.

Of course, if is a DECENTRALIZED Crypto Card, obviously the payment method cannot be converted from BTC from USD, for example, because to make a direct conversion, it would need an intermediary agent, taking away the proposal of decentralization.

What I have in mind would be a card that would access your wallet information (for this to happen, the card would probably have to be pre-build with your information embedded in it) and perform the currency transfer (BTC, for example) to the seller.

I'm not considering the consequences this would generate, just wondering if it would be possible to exist.

The real question is explaining how bitcoin works.  The best article I know about that is ""How the Bitcoin Protocol Actually Works"" by Michael Neilson.  But that's too long and complicated.  I feel like I need something simpler.

So, any article recommendations on how the **mechanics** of bitcoin work for my State Senator?"	help just spoke to my state senator about bitcoin and he asked me to send me some articles as the title says i bumped into my state senator on a trip to the library he was there for some event i spoke to him about bitcoin and he says he knows nothing about it although he seemed interested in learning more so he gave me his card and i agreed to e mail him some articles i want to send him two articles one on how bitcoin works the other on bitcoin s energy usage i am definitely going to send him this article https www lynalden com bitcoin energy the real question is explaining how bitcoin works the best article i know about that is how the bitcoin protocol actually works by michael neilson but that s too long and complicated i feel like i need something simpler so any article recommendations on how the mechanics of bitcoin work for my state senator 	0.0026750292163342237	0.9878761768341064	0.02143600583076477	0.028276551514863968	0.008073171600699425	0.22160817682743073	0.11264898627996445	8.519269272255769e-07	0.2634688913822174	0.021033797413110733

It has the functions of gold, but it is worth pennies. It is in the process of recovering its value. In fact, what is happening now is the flowers, the berries are ahead. There are no problems in the monetary system right now, when they start, I predict 2024 will be the year you will remember for the rest of your life. I can't even find the words to describe what will happen. If you don't buy bitcoin you will regret it for the rest of your life. I predict in a severe crisis in 2024-2025 bitcoin will jump to $150,000 - $200,000, that's the minimum. The maximum will go up to $500,000 per coin.

I am still new to understanding the technical side of it, but here are my takeaways:

1) The concern about mining centrality is overblown, as it has been proven before that nodes ultimately determine what happens with network direction.

2) The analysis of nodes relevant for consensus was confusing to me - it seemed like they were making the argument that miner nodes and public nodes were relevant for consensus and most nodes didn’t communicate widely enough to enforce consensus.

3) The most valid concern seemed to be in the Sybil attack, although that seems like it isn’t a consensus risk but more of a short term transaction routing risk (not a threat to long term network security)

4) ISP censorship in a country like the US seems very far outside the realm of possibility, but never say never?

literally be replaced with a SQL database at this point; you\'d get as much scalability as you want, and there would be no tradeoff in decentralization b/c the chain has none to begin with. **People in crypto don\'t actually want to get rid of the banks; they just want to be the first to get in on the bank that will give them the biggest yields.**\n\nIt\'s been said here before, but Solana is a scam: I knew it from the second I heard the CEO of the development company describe the ""network switch model"" of ""doing one thing (high scalability and throughput for dApps) and doing it well"". Here\'s my reasoning:\n\nI work in the tech industry, and I can show you a ledger that can scale faster and for cheaper than Solana right now. Moreover, it\'s more stable and you\'ll have next to no problems using it b/c *the underlying tech has already been in use since the \'70s*!\n\n... It\'s called a SQL database. It can handle millions of TPS even without complex scaling schemes, and it gets faster as you add more machines to it. You can run pretty much any financial application you want on top of it with no problems b/c, in fact, *all of traditional finance is already built on top of it*. Instead of using a complex language like Solidity or Rust, devs can literally use JavaScript. You can even log into it with your Facebook account!\n\nThe problem is: What I\'m describing is 100% centralized. In fact, it\'s literally the technical foundation for all centralization of data; it\'s the bookkeeping layer behind the billions and trillions of dollars that the banks and big tech are screwing people out of every day (the *settlement layer*, if you will).\n\nThe point I\'m getting at is that: **If you have a ledger that can be rolled back at the discretion of a central group of authorities, then it\'s literally a glorified database being run by a glorified bank.** If you have no problem with this, then you\'re in crypto for the wrong reasons; therefore, I suggest it\'s time to reexamine things.\n\n**Citing a comment I made from below to clarify (thanks to** u/Halvinz)**:**\n\n&gt;I\'d imagined that any dev reading this would forgo the technical nitty-gritty, as this *is* Reddit. My point is that Solana has a closed validator set, a closed-source protocol, *and* a literal Discord channel where it\'s openly and explicitly scheduled network shutdowns with validators whenever it became inconvenient to fight D/DoS attacks.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Solana clearly wasn\'t built in the makings of a blockchain, which is decentralized by definition; my point is that you could build pretty much the exact same UI/UX with a SQL database as a storage backend, and you\'d have no loss in uptime or security (if anything, those would be better!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Solana could literally be replaced with a SQL database at this point; you&amp;#39;d get as much scalability as you want, and there would be no tradeoff in decentralization b/c the chain has none to begin with. &lt;strong&gt;People in crypto don&amp;#39;t actually want to get rid of the banks; they just want to be the first to get in on the bank that will give them the biggest yields.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been said here before, but Solana is a scam: I knew it from the second I heard the CEO of the development company describe the &amp;quot;network switch model&amp;quot; of &amp;quot;doing one thing (high scalability and throughput for dApps) and doing it well&amp;quot;.
