With that said there is still the possibility of rug-pulls and scams happening.

Even at the L1 level, the terra/Luna system could have been built on polkadot. Not that I see Terra/Luna as a scam but more of an irresponsible experimental stablecoin project that imploded with some scammy stuff on the side.

It's a [complicated algorithm](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-phragmen). I've definitely had times where I was stuck with the same validator for long periods of time (in one case, much to my detriment, as the validator had changed their commission rate to 100%... but I digress...)

Generally, however, the reason this happens is because your amount of DOT/KSM fits very well to help reduce the variance (which is one of the big goals of Phragmen). So for example, if the mean amount of DOT on a validator is 1\_000\_000, and you are nominating that validator with 10\_000 DOT and another account is nominating it with 990\_000, you both will often find yourself nominating that validator since they ""fit"" so well.

That said, nominating is essentially an ""approval"" process - you are saying that you would be OK with nominating any of the validators you select for nomination. If you're not OK with actively nominating that validator, on a regular basis or not, you shouldn't be nominating it."	4941d08b62d7709e10b4d5fcca811b85a2e9720d	True	False					0	1653039616		0	{}	i9b48fk	False	t3_utbr9c	False	True	t3_utbr9c	/r/Polkadot/comments/utbr9c/almost_always_end_up_with_the_same_validator/i9b48fk/	1653039628	1	False	True	False	Polkadot	t5_2ublt	r/Polkadot	public		0	[]		as u antiwrappingpaper said it s sometimes difficult to understand why phragmen does what it does it s a complicated algorithm https wiki polkadot network docs learn phragmen i ve definitely had times where i was stuck with the same validator for long periods of time in one case much to my detriment as the validator had changed their commission rate to 100 but i digress generally however the reason this happens is because your amount of dot ksm fits very well to help reduce the variance which is one of the big goals of phragmen so for example if the mean amount of dot on a validator is 1 000 000 and you are nominating that validator with 10 000 dot and another account is nominating it with 990 000 you both will often find yourself nominating that validator since they fit so well that said nominating is essentially an approval process you are saying that you would be ok with nominating any of the validators you select for nomination if you re not ok with actively nominating that validator on a regular basis or not you shouldn t be nominating it 	0.002766939112916589	0.9882914423942566	0.8690943121910095	0.017585135996341705	0.9938602447509766	0.3699614405632019	0.07015947252511978	8.035853511501045e-07	0.42812877893447876	0.007208433002233505

You are right, it makes sense to see nominating as an ""approval"" process. I always also saw having multiple approved validators as a way of spreading my risk. But this probably not even really true at second thought, since I am not spreading my stake across multiple validators.

Tether is currently being deployed natively on Kusama and soon on Polkadot. 

Bitcoin is also available through the Kintsugi and soon on the InterBTC parachain.

It doesn't get bigger than that.

The rest of the projects, they are doing amazingly while growing and being adopted at a great rate. As for rugpulls and scams. Parachain auctions seem to be a significant block for bad projects. Compare the quality of the first batch of parachains vs. the Ethereum ICO wave of 2018. But ponzis and and ill intended projects will always make their own way to many ecosystems, after all, Luna had incredible development prior its collapse but the core tokenomics was flawed. 

As for the concern over the growth of the Polkadot ecosystem, it is valid, for now. However, the architectural design of Polkadot will be proven over time. Of course it's easier to spam a monolithic blockchain with 50 Uniswap copycats (specially if said blockchain is EVM compatible) but the core design of Polkadot, specially with shared security, has already proven to be a valuable asset with respect to parachain connections compared to IBC connections. Without shared security other IBC enabled chains were left open to attack due to the decrease of the price of LUNA (the base cryptocurrency of one of the blockchains) so that a sufficiently motivated attacker could have wrecked havoc on other connected parachains, had Luna not stopped its blockchain and relayers had not stopped operations as well.  

This is just a simple example of how the relay chain design is superior on many aspects and more robust to other alternatives, even though, right now it doesn't get the well deserved ""media attention"".
