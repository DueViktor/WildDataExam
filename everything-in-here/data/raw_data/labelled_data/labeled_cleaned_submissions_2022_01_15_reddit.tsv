Use lightning as a checking account when given the option and immediately exchange fiat to replenish funds. This removes value from the circulating fiat economy and into the Bitcoin economy. If your spending is small % of savings tax implications should be minimal or positive**

People seem to think that you should always purchase things with fiat rather than Bitcoin because it is the weaker form of money. This is nonsense. **As long as there is liquidity to exchange fiat for BTC the opportunity cost is exactly identical**. Any money you spend is money that could’ve gone towards stacking sats, whether you exchange it or not. 

I expect within the next year we will start to see more wide scale adoption of lightning by retailers, online services, and individuals. The network is gaining liquidity, it works, and the financial incentives are there. *When* this happens we should all make it a point to *reward* that effort in the form of lower fees for merchants and more liquidity for the network to encourage **transferring as much value as possible out of fiat and into Bitcoin where it cannot be fucked with**. 

Learn how lightning works. Get a lightning wallet. Make your friends pay you those $20 they owe you in sats instead of Zelle or Venmo. Be ready. There are enough bottlenecks to adoption without you being one of them. 

Now I know you’re thinking “But taxes..!!!”. More nonsense. 1. You only pay taxes on profits, so as long as you’re buying extra Bitcoin specifically for spending this just means you made more money. 2. Most places including US let you pick what method to use for calculating your BTC price (LIFO etc.). DCA + volatility means there’s good chances to declare losses or at least minimize gains taxes.

So as per the title, an acquaintance of mine was recently scammed out of £3.5k worth of bitcoin. Prior to this she had no dealings and no real knowledge of cryptocurrency or investing.

 A friend of hers had posted some instagram stories about how some crypto influencer managed to get them out of debt and taught them some great skills in crypto, investing and I imagine was offering to share some knowledge with screenshots of some bogus crypto gains. She, believing it was her friend, started up a conversation about the influencer in the story and to cut a long story short bought and then sent over £3.5k worth of bitcoin from crypto.com to her ""friend"" under the promise that they were going to manage and grow her investment.

A little while later I guess the conversation seemed off in some aspect from the norm so she contacted the same friend over the phone and it was discovered that he had no idea about any of this and was locked out of his account and couldn't access it. So this whole exchange had been bogus and she'd just sent all this money to some random stranger.

She's been in contact with Action Fraud, Crypto.com and I've urged her to contact the police but so far everything has been for nothing. After looking at this supposed crypto influencer they seem to be based in the US but I have no idea if this person is just an innocent bystander used as a clone account by someone else to make the scam believable or if he is the person involved. Reverse imaging some screengrabs from their insta hasn't turned anything up, but there also isn't a Twitter or anything else associated with the account which I find strange if they're supposedly an influencer. 

Is there anything she can do? She's pretty much resigned herself to the fact that she's ever going to see that money again but it's likely that this person could strike again.

I'm purely looking for advice here, no victim blaming. She's learned the hard lessons already.

**Executive Order 6102** is an [executive order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)) signed on April 5, 1933, by [US President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_President) [Franklin D. Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt) ""forbidding the [hoarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoarding_(economics)) of [gold coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_coin), [gold bullion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_bullion), and [gold certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_certificates) within the continental United States."" The executive order was made under the authority of the [Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_with_the_Enemy_Act_of_1917), as amended by the [Emergency Banking Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Banking_Act) in March 1933.  

 The stated reason for the order was that hard times had caused ""hoarding"" of gold, stalling economic growth and worsening the [depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression) as the US was then using  the [gold standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard) for its currency. 

[Presidential Proclamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Proclamation) [2039](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Proclamation_2039)  that forbade the hoarding 'of gold or silver coin or bullion or  currency', under penalty of $10,000 and/or up to five to ten years  imprisonment."

**Executive Order 6102** is an [executive order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)) signed on April 5, 1933, by [US President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_President) [Franklin D. Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt) ""forbidding the [hoarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoarding_(economics)) of [gold coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_coin), [gold bullion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_bullion), and [gold certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_certificates) within the continental United States."" The executive order was made under the authority of the [Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_with_the_Enemy_Act_of_1917), as amended by the [Emergency Banking Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Banking_Act) in March 1933.  

 The stated reason for the order was that hard times had caused ""hoarding"" of gold, stalling economic growth and worsening the [depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression) as the US was then using  the [gold standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard) for its currency. 

[Presidential Proclamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Proclamation) [2039](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Proclamation_2039)  that forbade the hoarding 'of gold or silver coin or bullion or  currency', under penalty of $10,000 and/or up to five to ten years  imprisonment."	bitcoin is digital gold history if not repeats itself it will rhyme executive order 6102 incoming https preview redd it i5o29ekxmnb81 png width 700 amp format png amp auto webp amp s c25fe2c48eec3268d3b9c99dd34fb083e286ea25 executive order 6102 is an executive order https en wikipedia org wiki executive order united states signed on april 5 1933 by us president https en wikipedia org wiki us president franklin d roosevelt https en wikipedia org wiki franklin d roosevelt forbidding the hoarding https en wikipedia org wiki hoarding economics of gold coin https en wikipedia org wiki gold coin gold bullion https en wikipedia org wiki gold bullion and gold certificates https en wikipedia org wiki gold certificates within the continental united states the executive order was made under the authority of the trading with the enemy act of 1917 https en wikipedia org wiki trading with the enemy act of 1917 as amended by the emergency banking act https en wikipedia org wiki emergency banking act in march 1933 the stated reason for the order was that hard times had caused hoarding of gold stalling economic growth and worsening the depression https en wikipedia org wiki great depression as the us was then using the gold standard https en wikipedia org wiki gold standard for its currency presidential proclamation https en wikipedia org wiki presidential proclamation 2039 https en wikisource org wiki proclamation 2039 that forbade the hoarding of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency under penalty of 10 000 and or up to five to ten years imprisonment 	0.0025522413197904825	0.9881561994552612	0.4428519606590271	0.9623005986213684	0.0077078696340322495	0.2526375651359558	0.07435060292482376	8.608642474428052e-07	0.305968314409256	0.01069182064384222

&gt;“We are going to launch Crypto Rio and invest 1% of the Treasury in bitcoin,” Paes said.

The 52-year-old member of Brazil’s Social Democratic Party praised Suarez’s efforts to transform Miami into a cryptocurrency hub. The latter previously [said](https://cryptopotato.com/miamis-mayor-open-to-explore-investing-1-of-citys-treasury-reserves-in-bitcoin/) he is open to exploring the idea of putting 1% of his city’s Treasury reserves in bitcoin.

While Miami has positioned itself as the cryptocurrency center of the USA, Rio aims to become the South American hub for the digital asset industry, Paes asserted:

&gt;“Rio de Janeiro has everything it takes to become the tech capital of South America. Events like the Rio Innovation Week come to strengthen the city’s image as the perfect place to work, live, and innovate.”

The possible bitcoin adoption is considered a massive step for the development of the primary cryptocurrency since Rio de Janeiro is the financial heart of Brazil. Its economy is also one of the largest in the Latin American region and among the fastest-growing globally.

The first one is the difference between a node and a miner, who is the one that validates the blocks? A miner is also a node or those are two totally separated entities? The second one is: as far as I've understood a miner has to find a certain hash in order to mine the new block and receive the rewards, so does that mean that miners have to find that hash in 10 minute? What happens if they take longer than that? Thanks for making me understand better this and sorry for my ignorance!

I made the mistake of my life to send some BTC (and some other crypto) to [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) wallet's trading account and the next day they locked my crypto asking for my occupation/source of funds/etc. Of course I should know better that ""not your keys not your crypto"" but it's too late now. When I saw that email I panicked and tried to send all my crypto out of that platform but as you know, transaction is still in review after two weeks... What I'm thinking is convincing them somehow to take my crypto out of ""In Review"" status and just let them be in their exchange so that I might have the ability to take them all to my private key wallet.

So what do you advise me to do? If I manage to get as much crypto as I can to my private wallet in that exchange and then use the seed phrase to recover them elsewhere, will that work?

The current inflation rate is \~6,8-7%.

The inflation rate is rising, and this December’s rate was **the highest since June 1982**. 

If prices grow by 7% per year, **this means that in 10 years, all goods will become \~2 times more expensive.** You can say that rising salaries offset inflation, but this is not the case because they have grown by only 4.7% this year.

The Federal Reserve System (FRS) says that as soon as the problems with the supply chains caused by the Coronavirus are resolved, the situation will stabilize. Still, the new variant of Omicron is exacerbating the situation the Coronavirus is progressing.

Due to these events, the dollar is becoming weaker. **If we look at the USD/BTC chart, we can see that the dollar gets weaker against bitcoin; therefore, Crypto enthusiasts often talk about bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.**

I just have three things I need to say. Take it or leave it.

1. Money is a construct. It doesn’t follow laws of hard science. Stop saying there is nothing “they” can do to stop it. “They” can shut it down tomorrow if they want. Cold storage???Great protection from guy down the street. No protection from “them.” Please stop pretending you are some martyr. You are a greedy spit who wants to eventually cash out your BTC for fiat. And that’s ok. “They” know this and see BTC as a useful form of digital gold for ppl to use. BTC, while a great investment is not a way to fight the man.

2. It’s not going to replace fiat. It was never intended too. It can and will be confiscated by central authorities if you do sketchy spit. NOT BECAUSE YOU ARE A WOKE OR RIGHTEOUS MAVERICK!!! BTC will be integrated into the money system as digital gold. Money printing and debt are only of concern when Dems are in office. Stop speaking as if these things are more than mere keystrokes. When conservatives take over you will hear crickets regarding the printing, the cost, or any other man made concept. The world will go on. And Please stop using fiat as evidence for the apocalypse. Surprise surprise civilization will likely go out with a whimper. Diabeetus, extreme temperatures, impotence etc. Our numbers will slowly dwindle along with passion and purpose. The aliens will scratch their heads one day and say wait, whatever happened to the humans? It will be a topic of much debate. 

3. Tech is awesome. Enjoy this moment in time when tech brought us digital gold and enjoy adopting early! There is waaaay to much tribalism in the crypto space. BTC is awesome but there will be many winners. Anytime tech makes like easier it should be applauded. Don’t hate ppl for not loving the projects you believe in.

That’s all. Goodnight you greedy bastards. And while you are all special please remember your d*ck is not that big and your pockets not that deep. No one cares about your BTC and No one is coming to get you… except impotence, diabeetus, and of course despair."

But now that all that Solana Summer hype has disappeared from a lot of investors and Solana has had its issues pop up here and there I still am buying as often as I was and just as much as I was before. It goes right to my Ledger Nano X and gets staked on SolFlare not to be touched for at least 3 years  (right now that's my timeframe). The team and the possibilities with this Coin are just phenomenal. I will not make the same mistake I did with MATIC in 2020. I believe in Solana and these issues will be fixed!!

So posting it here anyway since SOL is my biggest bag ;) Plus, I much prefer this sub anyway! 

**Prelude**

Before I get into the weeds, let me start by saying that this is purely meant to be an educational post; It is not meant to bash any project. On the contrary, I hope the many DeFi 2.0 projects still around will eventually recover (I know many have rugged - *shame* on those teams).

However to recover, we need to stop the charade. Many users still assume that the high APYs equate to free money and that everyone can magically buy lambos if they hold for a year (3,3 is a myth). Sadly, many of these users remain uninformed because of ultra defensive mods - any form of meaningful real discussion is dismissed as FUD and users who dare speak out get banned from their subs or discords.

It takes a lot of effort to get a project going, and for what it's worth, I believe many users and devs went head in first (like I did) without *truly* understanding the economics of DeFi 2.0. Hopefully this post brings to light the reality of things, and hopefully we can have meaningful discussions on how the projects can create actual value for all its users.

**The Rise**

While DeFi 2.0 was started by Olympus DAO early in April 2021, it only really hit mainstream crypto a few months ago (around the Oct-Nov 2021 period) when multiple forks of Olympus DAO started appearing across multiple chains. OHM hit a local peak in Oct, rallying nearly 5x from its low in Aug.

The price appreciation itself is enough to make anyone turn heads, but what *really* drew people in was the fact that it was promising insane APYs. If my memory serves me right, it was giving close to 8,000% at that point. This sounds small today if we compare it to the 80k% or 800k% that some projects are offering now, but back then only comparison was yield farming on DEXes giving you two digit APY on average with some occasional three digit ones.

A good number of people were naturally skeptical to begin with, but many saw the success of OHM and were now presented with the opportunity to take part in something identical (as many projects were forked) *but* at an early stage.

Some went further to try to read the docs, watched multiple YouTube videos, chatted up the community to understand further, all in hopes to understand the mechanics of this amazing new protocol. Is it too good to be true? Or did we the crypto community really come up with something so revolutionary that we all can *truly* get rich together if we simply held? The game theory component really sounded plausible and it seems to have been proven true because OHM was already half a year old!

Many calculated that they only needed a month or two just to recover their capital (solely from the emissions) and decided that the odds were in their favor.

I was one of such people. And boy *were we so wrong*.

**Econs 101**

Unfortunately despite how cool game theory is and how this revolutionary experiment found some early success, you cannot escape the basics: Value needs to come from somewhere.

If a system does not bring in value externally, it is a zero sum game within the system. In a zero sum game, for you to make money, someone else must lose money.

No matter how you dress it up, add sparkles, blow bubbles, this fundamental truth remains.

""But Moo, I have more tokens now so you're wrong!""

Yeah, not really. You may have more tokens now, but in the absence of new investors, your portfolio value remains the same. The difference is that you may have started out with buying 10 tokens for $100 each, and now you have 100 tokens that are worth $10 each. Your portfolio was worth $1000 then, and it's worth $1000 now.

Of course, this didn't happen because what happened in reality was not only did insufficient new investors come in, many ""old"" investors yanked their money out (i.e. dumped on you). So now there is less money in the system for everyone, which means on average, everyone who did not yank is sitting on losses.

""But Moo, I can just hold with my diamond hands and given enough time, I *will* make money because of the rebases. It's all about the (3,3)! You know nothing!""

Sorry fren. Reminder: In the absence of new money, you will never recover. You may get more tokens, but your portfolio value remains the same. You may be getting that insane APY, but your token value will simply keep depreciating till the end of time. Yes, even way below the supposed ""$1 intrinsic value"" (another myth by the way - the actual math is it is a parabolic curve that tends to zero but never actually touches it).

The only way you can recover is that if new money comes in to feed the system. And you now make money by dumping on them.

**The Hard Truth**

And that brings us to our next point: New money coming in to feed old money.

Sounds familiar? That's right! Good ol Mr Ponzi.

Many people don't like this word but unfortunately it really is true for most cryptocurrencies. There are many definitions of financial terms, but for the sake of this educational piece, let's define a few key words so we're all on the same page as to what they mean here when I use them.

1. Investment Money: Money that people are expecting to yield a profit from.
2. Revenue: Money that people are happy to give up in exchange for goods or services. They are not expecting to get their money back.

In the absence of revenue, a project is a zero sum game. Investors with their investment money cannot make a profit other than by taking money from another investor. Whether you like it or not, this is a ponzi scheme.

""So are all cryptocurrencies ponzi schemes?""

A lot are, but not all. Take Ethereum for example - while the gas fees are truly disgusting, you don't expect to get your gas money back. You understand it is an expense you have to pay, and you are willing to pay for it due to the service you receive (being able to use the network). These gas fees are revenue for Ethereum - what they choose to do with it (e.g. burn it), is another topic altogether.

Another example would be DEXes - most will charge a percentage fee for using their liquidity pools. Usually a large portion of the fees go to to the liquidity pool providers, while the rest goes to the DEX.

**Investing in Ponzis**

""Since so many projects are ponzis, should we not touch them at all?""

Well generally you should avoid them, but there are exceptions. Remember our Econs 101? Value needs to come from somewhere. So long as the project can eventually bring in revenue (i.e. external value), this revenue can be used to pay its investors.

Not all projects will hit the ground running with a revenue model, but if they have the ability to continue in the long haul, chances are that they should come up with a revenue generation model. Then... it might be worth looking at. But honestly, it would be a safer bet to invest in projects that are already generating revenue.

**Why target DeFi 2.0?**

I know there are many non-DeFi 2.0 projects that technically classify as a ponzi so you may be wondering why I created this giant post specifically about DeFi 2.0.

Well, because none of the other projects have insane APYs.

Sure, some of you know the economics but unfortunately the majority naturally equate the APYs to the amount of money they will make. Heck, there's even a project that has a calculator to show how many lambos you can buy given enough time! This to me is a giant lie that DeFi 2.0 projects are perpetuating, and I don't think that's healthy for the community.

Innovation is great and DeFi 2.0 actually brought in some pretty cool concepts like self ownership of liquidity pools. Innovation should continue if we want crypto to lead the pack, but it should never be at the expense of taking advantage of others. If we truly want to bring about a brighter future, we need to do things above board and be forthcoming with the risks. This is one of the tenants as to how we bring in greater adoption into crypto.

**The Future of DeFi 2.0**

There are a few projects that have already started on the path of revenue generation and I commend them for it.

However, we must not kid ourselves that having something like a 8000% APY is realistic. Maybe one might succeed and turn into the next richest man on earth, but the odds are exceedingly low.

Reasonably by investing its treasury into stablecoin farms, projects should be able to get anywhere between 10-20% quite easily. Maybe work a little harder, dig a little deeper, and throw in some luck and maybe... just maybe... you can return a 100% gain to your investors. But higher yields equal higher risks. And the more you push it, the more you put at risk all your investor money turning to zero.

Mind you, a large treasury also doesn't equate a bigger return for all you investors. In fact, the larger the treasury, the harder it is to generate huge percentage gains.

For example if your treasury was only worth $10, you could perhaps turn that into a 10x gain by using that to setup a lemonade stand and get $100 back.

But if your treasury was worth $1 billion, you better have some genius level ideas as to how you are going to generate $10 billion back *within a year* (also Elon Musk and Jeff Bezoz would probably want to hire you).

So what should projects do?

Start generating revenue **AND** nuke that APY down to the *actual* percentage your project can return. Investors at that point can then properly decide if this is the level of risk/returns they want, and they can choose to stay or leave accordingly.

The sooner projects accept this truth, the sooner they can start working to actually return you your money (sorry I know most people are heavily down at this point - I am too).

And for those projects who continue to ban constructive criticisms and want to stay in fairytale land, leave the first instance you can. Ultimately, your fate lies in whether they can execute on the best ideas. If they are not sourcing as many ideas as they can, and executing on those ideas, it is a massive red flag.

I hope this brings to light what DeFi 2.0 actually is and I am positive that as a community we can continue to innovate further to bring DeFi to a whole new level!"

a safer bet to invest in projects that are already generating revenue why target defi 2 0 i know there are many non defi 2 0 projects that technically classify as a ponzi so you may be wondering why i created this giant post specifically about defi 2 0 well because none of the other projects have insane apys sure some of you know the economics but unfortunately the majority naturally equate the apys to the amount of money they will make heck there s even a project that has a calculator to show how many lambos you can buy given enough time this to me is a giant lie that defi 2 0 projects are perpetuating and i don t think that s healthy for the community innovation is great and defi 2 0 actually brought in some pretty cool concepts like self ownership of liquidity pools innovation should continue if we want crypto to lead the pack but it should never be at the expense of taking advantage of others if we truly want to bring about a brighter future we need to do things above board and be forthcoming with the risks this is one of the tenants as to how we bring in greater adoption into crypto the future of defi 2 0 there are a few projects that have already started on the path of revenue generation and i commend them for it however we must not kid ourselves that having something like a 8000 apy is realistic maybe one might succeed and turn into the next richest man on earth but the odds are exceedingly low reasonably by investing its treasury into stablecoin farms projects should be able to get anywhere between 10 20 quite easily maybe work a little harder dig a little deeper and throw in some luck and maybe just maybe you can return a 100 gain to your investors but higher yields equal higher risks and the more you push it the more you put at risk all your investor money turning to zero mind you a large treasury also doesn t equate a bigger return for all you investors in fact the larger the treasury the harder it is to generate huge percentage gains for example if your treasury was only worth 10 you could perhaps turn that into a 10x gain by using that to setup a lemonade stand and get 100 back but if your treasury was worth 1 billion you better have some genius level ideas as to how you are going to generate 10 billion back within a year also elon musk and jeff bezoz would probably want to hire you so what should projects do start generating revenue and nuke that apy down to the actual percentage your project can return investors at that point can then properly decide if this is the level of risk returns they want and they can choose to stay or leave accordingly the sooner projects accept this truth the sooner they can start working to actually return you your money sorry i know most people are heavily down at this point i am too and for those projects who continue to ban constructive criticisms and want to stay in fairytale land leave the first instance you can ultimately your fate lies in whether they can execute on the best ideas if they are not sourcing as many ideas as they can and executing on those ideas it is a massive red flag i hope this brings to light what defi 2 0 actually is and i am positive that as a community we can continue to innovate further to bring defi to a whole new level

As a Solana automated market maker (AMM) optimized for trading pegged assets, the NeoNomad Finance ([neonomad.finance](https://neonomad.finance)) has seen significant growth in just the past month:

- Over 5000+ Telegram members.
- 3000+ Twitter Followers
- Launched the NNI Smart Contract on Solana in preparation for the IDO.

Since inception, NeoNomad’s mission has been to connect the world’s assets through providing a networked liquidity foundation. Because assets from one blockchain can’t natively exist on another, stablecoins are an elegant way to trade into and out of tokens on disparate blockchains and exchange value across the ecosystem. Due to its speed and scalability, Solana is the ideal blockchain to serve as the settlement layer for NeoNomad liquidity network.

The future of finance has no borders. We believe that finance should be permissionless, and every asset in the world will eventually find its way onto the decentralized web.

As a result, we have decided that it is best to decentralize the protocol early on so that the community can help decide its course.

### Enter $NNI

NeoNomad Token (NNI), a Exchange token. 
The hard cap of NNI is 200 Million tokens. Distribution of NNI is as follows:

*70,000,000 NNI (35.00%) Staking/Mining Reserve/Liquidity Pools
40,000,000 NNI (20.00%) Team Allocation with (4 year linear release)
28,000,000 NNI (14.00%) IDO (Public Sale)
10,000,000 NNI (5.00%) Development (2 year linear release)
10,000,000 NNI (5.00%) Marketing &amp; Advertising (2 year linear release)
2,000,000 NNI (1.00%) Liquidity Reserve*

A portion of the mining reserve (2,000,000 NNI or 1% of total token supply) will be distributed during the first two weeks of the liquidity mining program. This ensures that from the beginning, will be given to actual users of the protocol and help align liquidity provision incentives.

The target launch date for the liquidity mining program is February 4, 2022 at 10:00 PM UTC. Follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Neonomadfinance) or join us on [Telegram](https://t.me/NeoNomadFinance) for the latest updates.

A grants program will be created from the Partnerships &amp; Ecosystem allocation to help support projects that benefit the NeoNomad ecosystem. Proposals will be reviewed by the Nomad team.

Thank you in advance and either way I hope you have a great Friday and rest of the weekend! WAGMI.

p.s. if you have any interesting medical questions or would like to know anything about the med student/vaccination job life please leave a message below and I'll try my best to answer thoroughly!
