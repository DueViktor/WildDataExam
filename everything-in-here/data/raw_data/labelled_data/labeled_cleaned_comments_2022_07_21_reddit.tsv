What do you mean by a ""monetary standard""? Are you envisioning goods and services would be priced in Bitcoin? What about contracts like debts, salaries, rents, subscriptions, lines of credit, refunds, insurance, taxes, leverage, annuities, etc.?

&gt; ... is impossible

It is absolutely possible. Just because something is being used as a monetary standard, doesn't mean its ""value"" is proportional to its supply.

If a substantial amount of debts were denominated in Bitcoin, it would probably make Bitcoin *more* volatile, not less. Debts mean there is a constant demand of people who need to make fixed Bitcoin payments; if there isn't enough Bitcoin supply to satisfy this demand Bitcoin ""moons"" and the debtors go bankrupt (this includes companies paying negotiated salaries, people paying mortgages, people still paying off taxes from last year, companies who have already agreed to buy something at a fixed price, etc.).

This was historically a big problem with Gold as a unit of account, and there were quite a few financial panics, mass bankruptcies, and deflations that essentially amounted to a vicious cycle of Gold mooning and Gold debtors going bankrupt.

Of course, people can and do use Bitcoin today to pay for purchases and settle debts denominated using other units of account (c.f. Bitpay and El Salvador's experiment). People can also already use credit cards to buy goods and services and then pay of the credit card using Bitcoin at the end of the month, which is almost the same thing (well, if they didn't want *any* Fiat exposure, even negative Fiat exposure, they'd have to sell some Bitcoin every time they made a credit card purchase).

If could become more popular for this purpose, but this won't necessarily give it a more predictable or stable value (unless its future popularity is predictable and also its investment demand also predictable). Assets with high expected return also tend to have high volatility. If you want something which minimizes your risk of substantial short term loss (for any reason), it probably won't have good long term returns (savings accounts are a good example of this)."	db0ae5f4ccf6ff56336a76b2803c4bceb23801f1	True	False					0	1658303763		0	{}	igw2rw6	False	t3_w2uvyy	False	False	t1_igvdki8	/r/Bitcoin/comments/w2uvyy/nobody_is_worried_about_inflation_it_will_only/igw2rw6/	1658303777	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]		 gt which if bitcoin were to become a monetary standard what do you mean by a monetary standard are you envisioning goods and services would be priced in bitcoin what about contracts like debts salaries rents subscriptions lines of credit refunds insurance taxes leverage annuities etc gt is impossible it is absolutely possible just because something is being used as a monetary standard doesn t mean its value is proportional to its supply if a substantial amount of debts were denominated in bitcoin it would probably make bitcoin more volatile not less debts mean there is a constant demand of people who need to make fixed bitcoin payments if there isn t enough bitcoin supply to satisfy this demand bitcoin moons and the debtors go bankrupt this includes companies paying negotiated salaries people paying mortgages people still paying off taxes from last year companies who have already agreed to buy something at a fixed price etc this was historically a big problem with gold as a unit of account and there were quite a few financial panics mass bankruptcies and deflations that essentially amounted to a vicious cycle of gold mooning and gold debtors going bankrupt of course people can and do use bitcoin today to pay for purchases and settle debts denominated using other units of account c f bitpay and el salvador s experiment people can also already use credit cards to buy goods and services and then pay of the credit card using bitcoin at the end of the month which is almost the same thing well if they didn t want any fiat exposure even negative fiat exposure they d have to sell some bitcoin every time they made a credit card purchase if could become more popular for this purpose but this won t necessarily give it a more predictable or stable value unless its future popularity is predictable and also its investment demand also predictable assets with high expected return also tend to have high volatility if you want something which minimizes your risk of substantial short term loss for any reason it probably won t have good long term returns savings accounts are a good example of this 	0.002396942814812064	0.9894188642501831	0.09498429298400879	0.012349504977464676	0.007496128790080547	0.3431176245212555	0.08878345787525177	8.430349112131807e-07	0.366397500038147	0.001930359983816743

TL;DR unless you know everything there is to know about cyber security and cryptography and are willing to go through the trouble to continually verify (and if necessary update) that security, what you don’t know could hurt you. And there’s a LOT even the experts don’t know. 

So without further ado, here’s the short / simple reason to avoid this: peace of mind. There’s a 0% chance that a fully airgapped seed will be hacked, and the security of your wallet is exactly equal to the entropy of your seed (and the likelihood that your physical key can only be found by you). The risk of digitizing your key is unknown, and that is scary. Yes, it should be a very low risk, but ultimately unknown, especially if you’re considering very long term storage. Yes, it seems like the risk of cracking multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation should be significantly less than a physical backup being stolen, but bear with me until the end and I will show why that is not the case. 

Long version:

As solid as encryption and cryptography are, new vulnerabilities and (ESPECIALLY) faulty implementations are discovered all the time. Even a decade is an eternity in cyber security, so the more levels of encryption and security you add, the more attack surface and security deterioration you risk. 

Specific details:

Here are a few ways this could play out badly for you. Again, these are unlikely, but the goal is to reduce risk to the absolute minimum to maximize peace of mind. 

1) Dropbox gets hacked (again!). This could be a nation-state level attack that could result in your drive being wiped. Motivation could be full attack on destroying bitcoin / eliminating cloud-stored keys. Or someone could just hate Dropbox. Yes, you still have your physical backup, but now you’re reduced to a single point of failure, and it seems like you’re trying to avoid that. (See the end for my recommendation of avoiding this single point of failure w/o digital backup). 

2) Your encryption methods are faulty / don’t stand the test of time. There’s a huge rule of thumb in the cyber security community: don’t hand-roll your own cryptography. I’m serious - this is so common and so easy to get wrong. Even widely-used encryption libraries and methods have nuanced chinks in the armor that result in things like secret key discovery via off-curve attacks, decryption via reused or biased nonces, and the list goes on and on. It’s absolutely mindblowing how insecure so much of the internet is. It’s never as simple as “It’s AES-256 bits, so it’s good!” - nope, wrong. It wouldn’t be surprising in the least for (another) AES cipher algorithm to get popped. ECB and CBC were thought to be secure at one point in time, and now they’re joke-level ciphers. And just about every other AES cipher has a wrong way to use it. 

3) The security you’ve implemented is bypassed anytime you want to check your backup. This is a complicated set up, which means you’re going to want to check your access to this backup periodically. That means downloading from Dropbox, decrypting, and viewing the seed with your eyes. If an attacker was able to gain access to your computer and view your screen, you’ve just done all of the decrypting work for them, and it’s game over. Your wallet security is dependent on whether or not you can 110% guarantee that the device you’re accessing the backup on is secure. Social engineering remains the most successful method of exploitation. An attacker could put you in a situation where you need to check your backup on a device they control, and you might not be aware of any of that. Or, it could be as simple as compromising/hijacking an app you’ve downloaded on your computer and using it to steal files. There was a vulnerability discovered recently on macOS where a malicious third party app could access your documents folder. So, all that to say, your set up needs to include a guarantee that the device you’re using is 100% secure, and not to be scary, but that’s not practical for most. 

4) this is compounding a few of these to contrive an attack scenario (this is somewhat complex, but definitely not impossible). Due to poorly implemented browser cryptography (which has happened in the past, and could happen in the future), I’m able to deploy a MITM attack when you download your backup from Dropbox. Now I have a double encrypted file, but I’ve installed a keylogger on your device. That means I have the file and your passwords for decryption. Done. 

5) unknown attacks. There will absolutely continue to be more and more methods of attack, not only on the ever-increasing attack surface of browsers and web applications that frequently sacrifice security for user-friendliness, but even on modern cryptography. There’s simply no telling how devastating these could be, and we’ve seen some devastating stuff over the last couple of decades. 

Again, these are not likely scenarios. But they’re not impossible, and significantly more likely than guessing your seed, and that’s the point. If you keep it airgapped, you have a lot less to keep track of, you never have to worry about what you don’t know, and you have peace of mind. You might be content with that level of digital risk, and if that’s the case then I don’t think anyone here could convince a digital backup is less than ideal. 

I think the meat of the question is this: Is your security method more likely to get hacked than your physical backup is to be stolen? The short answer is IDK and you don’t either, which is kinda the point, but… I would say you could ensure the likelihood of your physical backup being stolen is as close to zero as possible by using collaborative custody multisig. 

This is extra, but I wanted to include this to address your desire for a backup instead of just poking holes in your digital copy idea. If you want a true backup: use 2 of 3 collaborative custody multisig with a company like Unchained. They have some really great educational content on that model, so I won’t go into a ton of detail here (unless you’d like me to!) but in short, there is no single point of failure, and it’s the best of all worlds. It’s simple and almost impossible to steal or lose. 

If you go with multisig and keep your seed phrases 100%, I think the likelihood of losing your funds due to physical backups being stolen is far less than the likelihood of a single wallet digital backup being hacked."	c5d4d6b8a828773b2acfdf4c1e3ed126c5f3e41d	True	False					0	1658303343		0	{}	igw299l	False	t3_w3c5pw	False	True	t3_w3c5pw	/r/Bitcoin/comments/w3c5pw/convince_me_to_not_do_this_with_my_seed/igw299l/	1658303356	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]		i

It’s probably another ten years before we see these dapps get good enough and used enough before they start biting at the heals of companies like Uber, but with the game theory of the cheaper prices they’ll bring to consumers and better wages they’ll bring to workers, it is almost inevitable that projects like these will replace the corporations we have dominating this space today, just like those corporations replaced the ones that dominated this space before them because of the same game theory principles that allowed them to do so.

192	[]	False		Philbot_			[]				text	t2_11b8b5	False	False	"Inverse to the trend of the dollar, 1BTC buys much more now than it did years ago. Yes there's volatility because it's so new and speculative for now, but that's the undeniable trend. Assets that can be created by the wave of a magic wand ultimately inflate because that's their utility. The utility of the dollar (or any free-floating currency) is that the central bank can print more of them for the government to spend as the economy genuinely expands, without needing to raise taxes. The problem is that they print way too goddamn much and never tax enough because politicians are corruptible and not held accountable.  Deficit spending is a tax nobody has to vote on, so they do it.  

This is how most generational wealth has been continually removed from the middle and lower classes and given to the upper classes.  Not through taxes, scams, or physical force, but rather through monetary policy. When new money is created, the top get first dibs and of course keep as much of it as they can before capitulating to increase labor wages.

Bitcoin however cannot be created by magic. The only way is to run watts through a computer.  Even after bitcoin reaches finite supply, miners will only mine Bitcoin that was expended through transaction fees. Right now, the transaction fees aren't worth very much but the uncirculated bitcoins are. Overtime, if Bitcoin continues to be as successful as it has been, fees will be worth much more and the miners will continue running watts through a computer to earn them to sell. Again, that's their craft to find the cheapest wattage and most efficient computing power.  Your craft, whatever it is, earns you income, right now in dollars but it doesn't matter if that changes in the future. You pay your expenses with your income and live your life with that income. But hopefully you have some leftover. With some of the leftover you might buy stocks, still a good investment medium, but now you have to trust the people at the company not to over-issue more shares or induce some catastrophic fuckup in which case you should sell the stock. 

There aren't any people to trust at a Bitcoin Headquarters. It doesn't exist. It wouldn't matter if it did exist. Bitcoin is just math and computer science, which of course people don't trust, yet, but that's because they don't understand it, yet.

So don't buy as much Bitcoin as you possibly can because then you'll want to sell it later and now you're speculating, which is fine if that's what you want to do. But Bitcoin offers up a new option, _true savings_, something that you literally want to never sell because there's nothing else that is as indelible. So today, maybe you can buy 0.1 BTC with your excess earnings. In the future maybe it's only 0.01BTC, all else equal. It doesn't really matter because you'll never want to sell it, just accumulate it over time. Don't buy more than you truly have in excess and don't borrow too much against it at any given time.

You can't really do that with any other asset because ultimately its quality degrades.  Yes there are some company stocks that have been around a long time and made people a ton of money. But they'll all ultimately die out because humans just can't be infinitely trusted. So still invest in companies with a portion of your earnings, and you can even collateralize stock holdings, but you'll be prepared to sell it someday. Gold cannot be faked but it's not practical to assay gold and transport it. 

So it's sort of like how long ago fabulously rich - generationally rich - families would take their excess resources and build a castle. Why?  Because it was the hardest thing for anyone to take away. You can't store gold in a hut and expect to protect it. And so as long as the family maintains the castle, they'll be rich. For example, the royal family of England would never sell Buckingham Palace, right? That's what makes them royals.

Well now every family can have a castle of sorts, just built of Bitcoin. Each generation takes their excess ""energy"" and embodies it into Bitcoin and it'll be in your family's hands forever as long as you properly manage it. 

That's how people arrive at these scenarios of 1BTC not just being worth a car like it is today, but in a couple years it will be with a starter home, in a decade it'll be worth a mansion - regardless of how many dollars that same mansion would cost.  

The difference is that some people plan on holding the Bitcoin until selling it all at once to buy the mansion and then they now have a mansion that degrades so eventually they'll want at least some of the Bitcoin back at some point. 

What I described above is an alternative where you literally never sell the Bitcoin because it's the hardest asset available and you can collateralize the Bitcoin for a smaller house than the mansion, but you'll maintain the benefit of having that Bitcoin in your control. You want to collateralize the hardest asset you can to borrow the softest asset you can at the lowest interest. The hardest asset is Bitcoin. The borrowed asset can be anything else.

Thank you for reading my long form comments. Regardless of what you think, we will together see what the future brings!"	a0d5ad1d6b5194d5671f1be53aab8e0b1bbfe453	True	False					0	1658299386		0	{}	igvx3id	False	t3_w332cv	False	True	t1_igvjjfh	/r/Bitcoin/comments/w332cv/my_daughter_want_to_invest_into_something_for_her/igvx3id/	1658299401	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]		inverse
