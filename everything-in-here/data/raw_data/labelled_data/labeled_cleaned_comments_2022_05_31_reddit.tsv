Payments: with the algorithmic issuance price fluctuations are inevitable (still think they will smaller), so using ETH for native pricing of everyday goods may still be far down the road or never come. But maybe - and that is a political thing - countries could choose Ethereum as the platform for their CBDCs. CDBCs could solve many issues we have today IF done properly. Basically, what if a country just releases a stablecoin on Ethereum? They can program whatever regulations/privacy/administrative features they want and perfectly guarantee stability.

So, the endgame for ETH is being fuel for all these applications. More sort of a commodity than a currency, or at least a hybrid.

There's a penalty system, but it's mostly very small penalties - for example, the amount you lose for missing an attestation (assuming the rest of the network didn't miss at the same time) is the same as the amount you gain for making an attestation. If you can keep your node running correctly 99% of the time, you should be making nearly as much as you would if it was running 100% of the time.

The big penalties are if you make contradictory votes, which generally shouldn't happen by accident: The only place you need to be careful is if you migrate your validators to a different computer or piece of software.

Twenty years from now, consumers won't really be using any of it directly. Companies will use smart contracts, especially internationally, because it will be cheaper to hire programmers to formally verify a smart contract once and use it forever to enforce asset ownership, than to pay lawyers on an ongoing basis to enforce asset ownership through international legal contracts in ever-changing legal environments.

It's possible to write provably error-free smart contracts, it's just very expensive at the moment because the technological infrastructure is still being put in place to do it efficiently. But it's possible, and it will only get easier over the next decade or two. Formal verification is the same technique they use to mathematically prove that the code in space landers is free from bugs and other unintended behaviors.

I believe that by 2050, everyone will be using blockchain technology without even realizing it or caring.

Sharding also won't affect L1 gas prices, as its been repurposed to instead offer a scalable *data storage* layer for the network, when the bottleneck right now is *computation.* L2 gas prices *will* be affected by sharding, though, as L2s can make use of the extra data storage that shards provide to pack more transactions within each batch, driving the individual user's cost of settlement down, which is one of the main things that users pay for within L2s."	b8d08a8d519f4d01172c6a1aa0d54d5cef7a8b2a	True	False					0	1653889421		0	{}	iaijg0i	False	t3_v0t2ld	False	True	t3_v0t2ld	/r/ethereum/comments/v0t2ld/how_does_pos_effect_gas_prices/iaijg0i/	1653889436	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_qqvkn	False	False		it doesn t gas prices are determined by the total amount of gas available in each block the block space and the speed at which the network is producing new blocks the block speed both of these things aren t changing with pos not in any meaningful way pos is reducing the block speed by around 10 ish but that ll be instantly cancelled out by an equivalent increase in network usage so pos cannot affect gas prices sharding also won t affect l1 gas prices as its been repurposed to instead offer a scalable data storage layer for the network when the bottleneck right now is computation l2 gas prices will be affected by sharding though as l2s can make use of the extra data storage that shards provide to pack more transactions within each batch driving the individual user s cost of settlement down which is one of the main things that users pay for within l2s 	0.0007886565872468054	0.9953989386558533	0.23665976524353027	0.9746029376983643	0.004281279165297747	0.08698488026857376	0.08763013035058975	8.480990913994901e-07	0.3879072070121765	7.949466817080975e-05

Heard about DeFi, heard about L2, took a deep dive, and here I am. Didn’t know shit about investing whatsoever, let alone in blockchain. Now I’m using complex financial instruments that were once exclusively available to massive institutions and market makers, on my frickin’ phone.

- @StarkWareLtd announce $100M Series D at an $8B valuation.

- @Immutable’s cross-rollup liquidity solution across multiple L2/L3 zk-rollups allows NFTs to move between Immutable, StarkNet, and any L3s built on top!

- StarkNet full node Juno fully syncs the state against mainnet for the first time, marking an important step towards the alpha release.

- Proposal: Canonized Post Processing. This one's a bit difficult to explain, but basically, it defines several blocks and transactions covered by a single proof as a ""chunk"", and then you can write a program that computes these in some sort of way that leads to efficiency gains for certain usecases. Copy/pasting from the proposal: 

&gt;Examples of useful CPP:

&gt;1. Econometrics
&gt;2. Non-linear statistics, like median tx size, median fee, etc. (linear statistics, like average, can be computed without CPP, chunk by chunk), this could be used for the following
&gt;3. Fee Mechanism design - long-range statistics could feed into fee mechanism to enforce better estimation
&gt;4.  Data availability
&gt;5. Daily state-diff, perhaps even using lossless compression
&gt;6. Daily volition/validium state diff, for users who are happy with daily use of Validium but at the end of each day wish to have data committed onchain

// cont. 

- Sign-in with StarkWare is now live!

- StarkGate bridge now supports DAI! You heard that right!

- Over 250 ETH have been bridged so far (there's a cap).

- StarkNet Community Call #14 including notes. Topic: myBraavos wallet presentation &amp; account abstraction examples.

- lots of dev resources this week! If you're interested in Cairo, definitely go check them out!

&gt;why use Diamond instead of some other proxy pattern? The reason to use a Diamond instead of a different proxy pattern is because a diamond can do some things that other proxy patterns cannot.

* Specifically a Diamonds enables you to have unlimited smart contract functionality at a single Ethereum address, by passing the 24KB smart contract size limit.  So if you want more functionality at an Ethereum address than can fit in a single contract then use a Diamond.
* A Diamond enables a project to develop and deploy incrementally without hitting a contract size limitation. In other proxy patterns you can upgrade the implementation contract to add new functionality but eventually the proxy pattern will hit the max contract size limit. A Diamond let's a project deploy something useful and extend the diamond over time in a standard and organized way.

&gt;Pros and cons of using a Diamond

Pros:

* Unlimited smart contract functionality at a single Ethereum address. This is useful for organizing a larger smart contract code base and integrating with user interfaces and other smart contract systems and 3rd party projects.
* Fine-grained and incremental upgrades. With a Diamond you can just upgrade the parts that need to be upgraded and leave the other parts alone, instead of having to redeploy everything.
* The capability to create independent, reusable deployed smart contracts. This is a level of modularity that did not exist before.
* Introspection and transparency of a smart contract system (a Diamond) with its loupe functions. The [louper.dev](https://louper.dev/) user interface uses this capability to show and use diamond functionality.
* A Diamond provides an organized way to extend a smart contract system after it has been deployed.
* Joining a group of enthusiastic and experienced smart smart contract developers.

Cons:

* OpenZeppelin contracts do not currently work with diamonds. But this is changing because OpenZeppelin plans to use Diamond Storage in its next major version. Diamond Storage is a technique for organizing and managing state variables, particularly in upgradeable contracts. Note that OpenZeppelin Solidity libraries do work in Diamonds. Other smart contract libraries such as [solidstate-solidity](https://github.com/solidstate-network/solidstate-solidity) and [ERC721A-Upgradable](https://github.com/chiru-labs/ERC721A-Upgradeable) can be used with diamonds.
* Learning curve to understand the Diamonds standard and Solidity techniques that are used.

&gt;typical workflow of what to do when

Diamonds is a flexible and general purpose solution to implement many kinds of smart contracts. Many projects start with a reference implementation and build on top of that or from there. Here is such a reference implementation: [diamond-1-hardhat](https://github.com/mudgen/diamond-1-hardhat).

&gt;costs of using Diamond (like cons): gas costs, complexity

**Gas cost:** The runtime gas cost to call functions on a diamond is about the same as other proxy contract patterns. Sometimes a diamond can reduce runtime gas costs in larger systems because it can share internal functions between its internal contracts (called facets) and use other techniques. More information about gas costs of diamonds is in an article [here](https://eip2535diamonds.substack.com/p/how-eip2535-diamonds-reduces-gas?s=w).

**Complexity cost:** A single diamond has multiple implementation contracts called facets. The facets can be isolated and independent from each other, in which case you can manage and think of each facet separately, which can reduce complexity. However it is possible to implement facets in a way that they share state variables between each other, in which case facets can affect each other and you need to think of and manage the facets together to the degree that they are integrated.

&gt;all this could be exemplified with a simple project with/without Diamond. To me, it is a crucial decision to go with some proxy pattern and I'd have to be able to evaluate the risks and chances.

Diamonds are useful for organizing larger projects which may not be considered simple because of the larger code base. To give an example of how a diamond can organize a code base, checkout the ""Facets"" documentation for the Aavegotchi project here:
