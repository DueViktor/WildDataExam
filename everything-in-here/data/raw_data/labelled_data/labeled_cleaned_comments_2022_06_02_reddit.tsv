But now that you *finally* asked, let's explain. 

Supply chain is a complex environment with several actors having to coordinate across the whole chain. 

One of the challenges of supply chain management is to spot mistakes and investigate them. It's even more difficult knowing than spotting a mistake sometimes only happens several days later or even later than that. Thus, investigation can quickly become expensive. 

Each of these actors can be responsible for a mistake. And none of them has an incentive to be responsible, but has an incentive for others not to cheat their own responsibilities. As such, there is a need to ensure all of them can ensure others aren't cheating, without cheating themselves about what others claimed. 

So, you provide a way for each of them to keep a historical record of what others said. That's where the need for the resilience of having several actors each keeping a record comes from. And that's one of the very few useful use cases of permissioned blockchains and where a manipulable database is way less useful, as you can't be sure a database hasn't been manipulated. With blockchains, collusion is extremely expensive as you'd need most other people to collude with you. 

As such, it hugely eases investigation by reducing the number of possibilities to cheat the system (or to erroneously claim something false, similarly). 

Of course, you also need the concept of seals or probes and similar traditional techs that allow for material proofs all along the chain. The blockchain only purpose here is to make sure history isn't revised and the step at which à mistake happened can't be cheated through data manipulation. At most, you end up with a quick scan of the chain state and two steps that are to be checked. 

And no, really, permissioned blockchains aren't expensive: you never need to use PoW for your chain. You can very well use the ultra cheap PoA or a flavor of PoS (though it will anyway very closely look like PoA due to being permissioned anyway)."	7182cf461a4fdfd2f3b487c9d4e11953176bb9e7	True	False					0	1654072375		0	{}	iarj6pj	False	t3_v1mg97	False	True	t1_iareaj0	/r/ethereum/comments/v1mg97/why_supply_chains_and_blockchain_tech_are_the/iarj6pj/	1654072388	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]			no you didn t you replied it already existed as if existing was enough and i said it would be better and cheaper emphasizing on the fact existing isn t enough but now that you finally asked let s explain supply chain is a complex environment with several actors having to coordinate across the whole chain one of the challenges of supply chain management is to spot mistakes and investigate them it s even more difficult knowing than spotting a mistake sometimes only happens several days later or even later than that thus investigation can quickly become expensive each of these actors can be responsible for a mistake and none of them has an incentive to be responsible but has an incentive for others not to cheat their own responsibilities as such there is a need to ensure all of them can ensure others aren t cheating without cheating themselves about what others claimed so you provide a way for each of them to keep a historical record of what others said that s where the need for the resilience of having several actors each keeping a record comes from and that s one of the very few useful use cases of permissioned blockchains and where a manipulable database is way less useful as you can t be sure a database hasn t been manipulated with blockchains collusion is extremely expensive as you d need most other people to collude with you as such it hugely eases investigation by reducing the number of possibilities to cheat the system or to erroneously claim something false similarly of course you also need the concept of seals or probes and similar traditional techs that allow for material proofs all along the chain the blockchain only purpose here is to make sure history isn t revised and the step at which mistake happened can t be cheated through data manipulation at most you end up with a quick scan of the chain state and two steps that are to be checked and no really permissioned blockchains aren t expensive you never need to use pow for your chain you can very well use the ultra cheap poa or a flavor of pos though it will anyway very closely look like poa due to being permissioned anyway 	0.0025565589312464	0.9886553287506104	0.04744856059551239	0.015544421970844269	0.008377624675631523	0.3744015097618103	0.07495787739753723	8.295969564642292e-07	0.3770328462123871	0.01456569042056799

Not saying L2 / rollups can't be added after the fact (see Ethereum) but these problems are already complex enough to be reasoned upon when having to deal with an already running ecosystem.

There will be community events, and if you like getting involved it's another great discord to add to your list.

Marinade also released *The Decentralizer,* a way to stake to multiple validators with a lot of customizations. The Decentralizer is best explained in this short video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1z5h99FKAM&amp;t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1z5h99FKAM&amp;t=3s)
