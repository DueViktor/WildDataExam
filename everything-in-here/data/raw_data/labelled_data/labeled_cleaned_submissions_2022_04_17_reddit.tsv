This particular political party will mainly focus on the adoption of decentralization in modern society. so the main goal, would be to expand on the idea of governing a society autonomously. Discussing such ideas are of extreme value to me, especially after I learned that human nature is destined to corrupt itself once it gains in power.

Like, for instance, what if we all voted through the blockchain? People could be incentivized a small fee if they participate in voting (stimulating people to actually participate in a democracy), it could all be done through your smartphone and you completely remove any risk of corruption or incompetence. There is no corruption (which is inevitable without technology) because everyone will be able to supervise. And with the removal of incompetence, you avoid counting mistakes, which are human errors (which is also something that's inevitable to avoid without technology).

This would not only make a democracy function a LOT faster and more efficient, it also provides us with instant data that doesn't need to be updated by humans. The development of this system also allows our society to expand on the idea of decentralization.   


Besides voting for a whole particular party, automatically agreeing with everything they stand for, we might aswel set up an even more advanced system that allows regular citizens with more diversity of choice. I had this idea of setting up different polls on particular policies. If the majority of votes agree on it, the policy has a high chance of being implemented (if its sustainable and realistic enough). If the voters are at a 50/50 split (or 33/33/33 or 25/25/25/25, depending on how many options there are) then the topic in question has to be debated much more intensively and frequently. 

I believe that democracy can be decentralized, ultimately decentralizing governance as a whole. It will just take a considerable amount of social awareness and technological advancement to achieve this.

What makes bitcoin a good store of value? 

* First, we must understand what money is. Money is a commodity that is scarce, durable, divisible, and fungible, and compared to other goods it has the lowest diminishing marginal utility. A good money is salable across time, space, and distance, and these dimensions correspond to money's role as a store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account, respectively. The fact that bitcoin is scarce and durable means that it is likely to hold its value over time, and it is therefore a good store of value. 

Even if Bitcoin is a superior money, doesn't the fact that the dollar has a vast network of users mean that bitcoin will struggle to displace it? 

* It's certainly true that the dollar is backed by the largest military in the world and used nearly everywhere. But in recent decades multiple countries have noticed that the prevailing dollar-focused monetary order has not benefited them, and have begun looking for alternatives. This has only accelerated with the weaponization of SWIFT in light of the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine. None of this guarantees that Bitcoin will be what replaces the dollar, but it does represent an opening of cracks in its otherwise unchallenged dominance, creating opportunities for some alternative to begin establishing a parallel network of users. If Bitcoin can first become one of the options, then outcompete the others, there's at least a plausible pathway to its becoming a global reserve currency. 

What is the 7th property of Bitcoin? 

* Immutability. Bitcoin has the other properties of money, but it would the first immutable currency. This would reduce important forms of moral hazard and make Bitcoin a nearly ideal base layer money."

But in recent decades multiple countries have noticed that the prevailing dollar-focused monetary order has not benefited them, and have begun looking for alternatives. This has only accelerated with the weaponization of SWIFT in light of the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine. None of this guarantees that Bitcoin will be what replaces the dollar, but it does represent an opening of cracks in its otherwise unchallenged dominance, creating opportunities for some alternative to begin establishing a parallel network of users. If Bitcoin can first become one of the options, then outcompete the others, there's at least a plausible pathway to its becoming a global reserve currency.

We're witnessing important history. 

This article states that non-perishable grain farming was the catalyst that propelled our species to rapid societal evolution. While this is mostly true, the author misses the underlying foundation, specifically, grain was used as a form of money. 

Assuming this audience understands money (this space is filled very bright minds), I won't belabor this juncture. 

Opinion: As a result, I think it's reasonable to conclude Bitcoin is/will be what grain was to our ancestors 12,000 years ago. It's going to propel our species to greater heights, in all facets. This will be the catalyst that helps our species reach newer heights on the Kardeshev Scale. What an amazing time we're experiencing. 

Is Bitcoin the ONLY reason? Certainly not. The transformation began October 31st, 2008 and is ongoing. It's difficult to parse through statistical significance without running regressions, which can't happen until worldwide Bitcoin adoption occurs. 

Opinion: Im sure agriculture was a radical idea when introduced to hunter-gatherers, just as Bitcoin doesn't make sense to baby-boomers. They'll either get it or pass away. Legacy money will pass away before moving to a Bitcoin Standard. Legacy money is controlled by the rich ruling class. It'll be a slow death until a capitalistic catastrophe causes society to adopt a Bitcoin Standard. When that happens, cryptocurrency will crash and rebuild onto Bitcoin.

They don't seem to need the money anyways..."	should we start donating to institutions only if they allow bitcoin donations i donate 4 figures each year the recent move of mozilla only allows pos coin donations just made me think that i should maybe start donating in bitcoin exclusively and stop donating to foundations where using btc is not possible i never really thought about that but the sooner we become like that as a community the faster i think adoption will happen obviously i will keep a list of exceptions but companies institutions foundations like mozilla who decide to take such steps definitely take a place on my blacklist they don t seem to need the money anyways 	0.04389142990112305	0.9894592761993408	0.15407660603523254	0.9528058767318726	0.007584854029119015	0.4720628559589386	0.06210777536034584	8.372804813916446e-07	0.21644209325313568	0.011261899024248123

For musicians and filmmakers in the entertainment industry, Audius and Theta provide a decentralised network. Many cryptocurrency YouTubers post their videos on Theta, where they keep the majority of the profits. Audius is a web and mobile app that allows musicians to interact directly with their fans, similar to Spotify. There will be no middleman taking the lion's share of the profit or interfering with the artist's creative process.

Even in the EV industry, something like bob eco coin, which uses its token for various causes and even uses EVs to combat pollution, is helping with a different approach. These are some industries that I never imagined would adopt blockchain in 2016 or 2017.

Bounties are a permission less way for people to get started with working in web3.\xa0\n\nThe talent supply in web3 is quite small in web3 compared to the demand from various web3 projects big and small. There are 100s of DAOs, 1000s of NFT Projects, 100s of DeFi projects and much more which all need people to work on them. Also not all this projects can afford a full time developer, designer content writer, social media manager and Community manager.\n\nSo bounties have become a way for this projects to get the the necessary talents they need without the cost and risk of a full time hire.\xa0\n\nBounties have also been a way for skilled persons to really contribute at the forefront of web3, earn while also staying free and not answering to a boss. It has also become a low risk learning curve for people looking to make the transition from web2 to web3.\n\nTens of millions of dollars have been poured into bounties and the space seems to be growing and encompassing new opportunities.\xa0\n\nWith this rise in popularity its becoming harder to stand out.\xa0\n\n#### Why perform a\xa0bounty?\n\nA common argument against bounties is that, you don’t get compensated for performing the bounties *(you can Earn NFTs if you perform bounties listed on* [*Voice*](http://www.voicedao.fun/)*)* even if you did a good job but didn’t win. Most bounties now are giving out compensations for the top three.\n\n1. **To get a taste of what working in web3 feels like**\n\nThere’s a notable difference when working in web2 than in web3, the first this is the direct human relationships (which can serve as networking) you form when performing this bounties.\n\nWhile working on a bounty you familiarize yourself with the nitty gritty of web3, from the lingo, to the technology to the people. This can be valuable in the future.\n\n2. **Building your web3 reputation**\n\nA massive upside to performing bounties in web3 is the fact that you begin the process of building your reputation in web3 for when you maybe want to get a full time job in web3.\xa0\n\nEvery web3 project wants to know what your web3 experience is when you are applying, saying you have performed multiple bounties (*and having the* [*NFTs to prove it* ](http://www.voicedao.fun/)) goes a long way.\xa0\n\n3. **You Earn NFT badges for the work you do**\n\nThis is a self plug\xa0:P but lets be honest earning [NFT Badges](https://www.voicedao.fun/bounties) that prove you did a particular high quality task in the NFT Space is valuable for both building a reputation and having a viable web3 work history. If you perform any of the [100s of active bounties](https://www.voicedao.fun/bounties) or [freelance gigs](https://www.voicedao.fun/freelance) listed on voice and submit your work for an NFT badge, we’ll review it for quality (just to make sure people aren’t just submitting low quality work for NFTs) then mint an NFT Badge for you with your address and Title of the the work you did, then send it to you All for Free. This way you are building up your project base and anyone who views your collection has an idea of what you’re good at. Check out voice here: [https://www.voicedao.fun](https://www.voicedao.fun/job-details?recordId=rec4WXVhV95aiNmwT)/\n\nEnd of the self plug, thanks for reading\xa0:P\n\n**4. Get Hired**\n\nAn effective way to get hired without going through the application process is to perform such a bounty so impressively that the project decides to hire you. There’s very little loss on your side but the upside is massive.\n\n#### How to Get started with\xa0Bounties\n\n1. **Use a Bounty Board**\n\nBounties are spread all over the web and the best way to get started is going for a [Bounty Board](http://www.voicedao.fun/) as it is a collated board of bounties from every bounty across the web.\n\n[Layer3](http://layer3.xyz/) and [VoiceDAO](http://www.voicedao.fun/) are the best in terms of bounties listed for every type of skill from writing to development to design etc they got it.\n\n**2. Choose a Bounty that fits your skill**\n\nGo through the bounties listed and choose a bounty that fits into what you can do and pays considerably well, in context with the work you’ll put in.\n\n**3. Digest the task, write an outline and try to reach out to the team**\n\nJust as the step says, Digest the task write an outline and try to reach out to the team.\n\nOnce you choose a task, really try to understand the task then write a sort of outline (or summary) then attempt reaching out to the team to see if you can show them what you got, just to confirm you’re on track\n\n**4. DO IT and SUBMIT**\n\n\xa0Perform the task and submit it, you’ll definitely not be the only one who did the task but you definitely have got a shot.\n\nIf you got the bounty off [voice](http://www.voicedao.fun/bounties), submit your work so you can receive an NFT Badge for the work done.\n\nThanks for reading, If you want to go full time web3 check out voice: [https://www.voicedao.fun/](https://www.voicedao.fun/)', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bounties in web3 have become a massive norm and engraved in web3 work culture.

I wanted to mention a project called [Wildland](https://wildland.io). From the leaders of [Qubes OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubes_OS) and [The Golem Project,](https://www.golem.network/) we're developing a set of open-source protocols and software with the aim of giving users back control over their digital data. What this means is that we are developing a new layer where your data is handled. *We are not a storage solution, but a management system that you can use with the flexibility to change storage providers easily.*

Wildland abstracts cloud storage, letting you have encrypted storage containers that are portable between cloud providers. It also supports replication between different cloud providers for redundancy and local cache storage for speeding up operations with slower backends.

We are also developing a [User Defined Organization](https://wildland.io/2022/04/13/UDO-research-WL.html), a new approach DAO for our decentralized governance model which utilizes our ERC-20 token, GLM.

# We are having a live AMA on [Twitter Spaces](https://twitter.com/WildlandIO/status/1514274652385951755) Wednesday, April 20th 6PM CET

and would love to have you join to ask any questions you have about the project. Why are we creating this project?

Today’s Internet is heavily consolidated around several Big Tech service providers, each of them operating their own closely controlled “walled garden” (i.e. data silo). Centralized, closed services can be very convenient and reliable but they come with heavy strings attached. On top of limited users’ agency there are also well-known problems associated with limited users’ privacy:

* data mining,
* sharing of data with third parties,
* behavioral profiling and monetization,
* moderation of data feeds.

# What we hope to achieve

Freeing users from dependency on service providers by going from a service-oriented Internet where corporations hold the reins, to a data-centered Web where the user is the sovereign. With Wildland we want to:

* give users and developers explicit control over their data and how its handled, so that they can control where it is stored, how it is processed, and what tools they are using to interact with it
* make it easy for users to switch storage providers, move or replicate data between different storage options, and acquire additional storage space from an open and competitive marketplace
* let users organize their data in a manner that supports their personal knowledge-management needs and practices
* allow unmediated publishing and sharing of data without third party supervision or interference
* create a fertile ecosystem for privacy-conscious app-developers who are willing to put users first

# Empowering users through the User-Defined Organization

We are developing Wildland around a user-first philosophy, therefore we want users to have the deciding voice on how the platform should operate and evolve.To fulfill this promise we’re developing a new model of governance for Wildland, with the aim of ensuring that the protocol’s heaviest users will have the strongest influence on its future development. We call this governance model the User-Defined Organization.

Any and all feedback are welcome! And stop by our sub r/wildland if you'd like to discuss anything around the project."	True	False	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	1261395	public	self	Introducing Wildland.

They both say a lot of wise stuff. I don't think there's a great conspiracy. I don't think Michael is naive or doing anything other than talking about what he loves.

I too love Bitcoin! Ra-Ra Bitcoin. What's not to like? All four hours are great. I recommend a listen.

At [\~03:23](https://youtu.be/mC43pZkpTec?t=12230) he begins to talk about the regulatory risks of ""tokens"" that are tied to ""a company"". The one and only time I noticed he mentions Ethereum is in this neighborhood; only to say that ""ethereum will compete with...""

Even things that these days call themselves ""DAO's"" in most case have a tie to a street address or to individuals who can be called to account for ""regulatory"" missteps

Among other things, I see DOW's as means of side-stepping regulations, especially as these kind of pressures get greater and folks get used to interacting with DAO's that have no true center and are therefore uncensorable and uncensurable. As someone who only knows so much, I *feel* that they are coming, whether they are now ""here"" or not (examples?)

In other words, DAO's, which don't really seem to exist in a practical way outside of Ethereum, will one day be able to make the choice to organize themselves in such a way as to say: Fuck your laws.

Maybe I'm wrong. I'd love some pushback about this dreamy vision I have.

It's hypothetical at this point, I'm sure, but regulatory risk diminishes as crypto, in all of its manifestations as ""true pseudonymity"" and borderlessness becomes achievable and become only a matter of ticking a checkbox when you roll out your DAO.

Recently several rival blockchains have arisen with success by solving the trouble posed by Ethereum. Avalanche, point network and Monero are the main rivals who are speedy and cheap to use.
Avalanche rose to fame through its Avalanche Consensus Protocol and as per the data collected by the Coin desk, Avalanche’s native token AVAX is the 10 largest token in the market.
Working of Avalanche
It is essential to reach a consensual decision in the world of a decentralized system. Avalanche uses the Avalanche Consensus Protocol which integrates the classical and Nakamoto protocol to get efficient results.
The classical protocol is known for its fast, green, and low maintenance benefits whereas the Nakamoto protocol is known for its decentralized and scalable blockchain.
AVAX TOKEN
AVAX is the native token of Avalanche and is often called as “red coin” by its holders. Holder needs AVAX to pay for the transaction efficiently. Where in Ethereum half the fee goes to the miners and the other half is burned, Avalanche burns its entire fee. Apart from this, the AVAX token can be used in stalking, which not only assists in participating in the validation process but also secures the blockchain. These factors are lacking in Ethereum which is why avalanche and point networks might beat Ethereum in the long run.
To use Avalanche, one has to buy the AVAX token on a crypto exchange program and transfer the said token into the DeFi wallet. If you want to bridge your crypto from different chains into an avalanche, this can be easily done using the bridge protocol like Hop Exchange.
There is no denying the fact that in the world of cryptocurrency it is next to impossible to hold a monopoly in the market because any new player can sweep off all profits with their unique feature.

war on all of us. The Metaverse has the power to become the privatization of reality itself unless we act.  Our actions, speech and connections tracked... our data, used against us... our lives under scrutiny for being ""woke"" enough. Our hard labor, double-taxed.\n\nI don\'t see why people are so excited about the ""creator"" economy. I have been a creator in the past... you don\'t want to be. Their interest is to lock you in, give you as little as possible and take as much as possible.\n\nThis is all of our future unless we do something.\n\n# Metaverse monopolized:\n\nI see huge potential for one big player to own a good chunk of the metaverse via the network effect.  The network effect happens when people can\'t use other platforms to contact someone in a platform without signing up. You can\'t talk with people unless you sign up for Facebook.

I'm new to crypto and making my first steps in this world, and I think I'm lacking a key piece of information.

I have a hardware wallet and I bought a small amount of eth from an exchange.

The exchange sent the eth to my wallet using a smart contract, my questions are:

1. What is the reason to use a smart contract instead of sending the eth directly?
2. My Hardware Wallet only shows the eth balance but not the transaction history like I see on my BTC wallet, when I asked the HW vendor about it they answered the reason for this is because smart contract transactions are not a regular transactions and are not supported by the app.After further research I learned that smart contract transactions aka internal transactions are not recorded on the blockchain.if so, how is it still possible to see the balance of my wallet on sites like etherscan.io? where is this balance coming from?"

In the past two years or so, everywhere I’d go I’d get bombarded with stories of people who turned rags to riches and suddenly found themselves with a windfall unable to handle its sudden power. Yes, that really happed, though the cases were rare and limited. And not as widespread as magazines would have you believe. The main issue is that these stories are easy to scoop around. 

Furthermore, it’s probably not going to be you who will find the next gem. Now everyone wants that next 100000x, and expectations have gone unrealized. Media will have you believe everyone will be a rockstar and a millinionaire, and that’s not happening. And people are frustrated. 

Instead, people should focus on cryptocurrencies for what they are, currencies. If you were to turn a profit, then great. But keep your expectations in check. In fact, go ahead and buy whatever you need with that profit. You don’t need to live on bread and water. There’s now many places that accept crypto as direct payments, take exeno for example that have started a whole platform for this, or Binance Pay that have issued a card system for this.

In the past two years or so, everywhere I’d go I’d get bombarded with stories of people who turned rags to riches and suddenly found themselves with a windfall unable to handle its sudden power. Yes, that really happed, though the cases were rare and limited. And not as widespread as magazines would have you believe. The main issue is that these stories are easy to scoop around. 

Furthermore, it’s probably not going to be you who will find the next gem. Now everyone wants that next 100000x, and expectations have gone unrealized. Media will have you believe everyone will be a rockstar and a millinionaire, and that’s not happening. And people are frustrated. 

Instead, people should focus on cryptocurrencies for what they are, currencies. If you were to turn a profit, then great. But keep your expectations in check. In fact, go ahead and buy whatever you need with that profit. You don’t need to live on bread and water. There’s now many places that accept crypto as direct payments, take exeno for example that have started a whole platform for this, or Binance Pay that have issued a card system for this. Even Visa is speculating the possibility of making this in actuality.
