Central banks of a nation hold USD reserves to hedge short USD positions in their economies.

71	[]	False		only_merit						"That all wealth is stolen is not correct, but that money is made up is. That something is made up is not really a bad thing. You know a car, a computer, the Internet, all these things were invented and made by a human, they did not exist ""naturally"". Most of the food is also made up. Bread. Bread is totally made up.

So the criticism then seems to be about the wealth and about the ""right"" to resources. So any kind of ""right"" is also made up, it's concept invented by humans. Yet, there are rights that come from the nature of a man. That's a property right for the man's own body. Who else, if not the man himself, should have the right to his own body. Likewise, if a man combines what is his intro creation of a new thing, who should that belong to if not the man itself? So a man combine his body and his time and his energy and a piece of wood or stone he finds produces a tool. There is a catch - the wood and the stone. But if it's not owned by anyone before, why should he not take it and use it. The nature (animals) do that all the time. And often they do not respect such previous ownership (but often they do). So there is nothing ""special"" about appropriation of natural resource by a man. 

The criticism says that nobody has ""more"" right to that piece of wood or stone. But that would imply that even a man on the other side of the globe would have the same right. But he does not even know that specific piece exists, nor he has any ability to get to it. So that does not seem very meaningful to distribute all resources globally to everyone. There would be many problems with such global distribution among all men (or even animals?). 

The most logical and natural way is to recognize property rights of men and include appropriation of unused resources as the primary way to acquire them."	b7c83fc75799176a88f68faf5fdd4659d70401ce	True	False					0	1659510100		0	{}	iir3r76	False	t3_wexzmt	False	True	t3_wexzmt	/r/Bitcoin/comments/wexzmt/how_do_you_even_reply_to_replies_like_this_post/iir3r76/	1659510112	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_lsrhhud	False	False		that all wealth is stolen is not correct but that money is made up is that something is made up is not really a bad thing you know a car a computer the internet all these things were invented and made by a human they did not exist naturally most of the food is also made up bread bread is totally made up so the criticism then seems to be about the wealth and about the right to resources so any kind of right is also made up it s concept invented by humans yet there are rights that come from the nature of a man that s a property right for the man s own body who else if not the man himself should have the right to his own body likewise if a man combines what is his intro creation of a new thing who should that belong to if not the man itself so a man combine his body and his time and his energy and a piece of wood or stone he finds produces a tool there is a catch the wood and the stone but if it s not owned by anyone before why should he not take it and use it the nature animals do that all the time and often they do not respect such previous ownership but often they do so there is nothing special about appropriation of natural resource by a man the criticism says that nobody has more right to that piece of wood or stone but that would imply that even a man on the other side of the globe would have the same right but he does not even know that specific piece exists nor he has any ability to get to it so that does not seem very meaningful to distribute all resources globally to everyone there would be many problems with such global distribution among all men or even animals the most logical and natural way is to recognize property rights of men and include appropriation of unused resources as the primary way to acquire them 	0.002484406577423215	0.9894025325775146	0.23131798207759857	0.09669796377420425	0.9947161078453064	0.4364805519580841	0.08762913942337036	8.367616146642831e-07	0.5055111646652222	0.05065038800239563

&gt; leaving everyone broke after having their life savings destroyed

Who keeps their life savings in non-interest-bearing USD? People who do this need some basic financial education.

Many people are actually *short* USD (people with mortgages, auto loans, student loans, margin loans, shares of companies who are short USD, DeFi loans against cryptos, deferred payments, HELOCs, etc.). Every long USD position is backed by a short USD position. You can short USD against a wide variety of collateral; without this collateral, USD couldn't even function.

Other people are long USD, holding savings accounts, CDs, Treasuries, corporate bonds, etc. The return of these assets is a function of *real interest rates*, not inflation. If you think real interest rates are too low, either don't save USD or short USD yourself to benefit from the low rates. Real interest rates are ultimately a function of the demand for USD assets (as a function of APR) vs the demand for borrowing USD (also as a function of APR; this is the supply of USD assets).

You don't have to long USD to use it as a unit of account or medium of exchange.

What they consistently fail to realise is that if bitcoin settled instantly it wouldn't be secure and it wouldn't be decentralised.

Every block your transaction gets buried under is one more block that has to be found by an attacker looking to generate the longer chain. It takes 10 minutes to find a block, and a lot of computing power to do so, if it is instant settlement then it means your tx is protected by little to no energy.

You also need 10 minute block times to allow the blocks to propagate through the decentralised network. There is no one oracle that holds the longest chain and distributes to nodes. You have to wait for that to happen organically through the network.

Soon, land will become much cheaper as its only utility will be growing crops and housing people. The excesses in price we see today are because people use it as a store of value. 

In regard to material goods; it's mostly energy (oil) related. Renewable energy is becoming so cheap that energy will become almost free within 20 years. Bitcoin incentivizes and accelerates this.

I'm not saying Bitcoin will solve all property wars immediately, but because Bitcoin makes wars much higher cost (inability to fund them through money printing) and significantly decreases the reward, conflicts will become much rarer and smaller in scale.

The biggest questions come from the IRS during extensive tax audit. If you cash out a big sum of money, it does, of course show up on your bank statements. I’d recommend documenting the purpose and following it up with receipts in case of tax audit.

For me, I just buy a lot of paintings from overseas and ship them. I’m sure the IRS thinks I’m a nefarious character, but when they look at my professional career — and when I recently sent them photos of my gallery events, they start to change their tone.

Let me introduce you to the law of conservation of mass. Cutting something into two halves still just makes a whole. It doesn't destroy half. It's still there. 

No amount of division adds anything more. 

Having smaller denominations possible with Bitcoin means that, while not causing any inflation (no addition), you can always divide the supply of Bitcoin among every human that wants some, no matter how many humans this means. 

Let's say that in 2136 when the block reward drops to 1 sat per block. Let's also say that there's 20.9 million lost BTC with only just shy of 100,000 BTC not lost by then. We're entertaining a 99.5% loss of BTC here.  Each BTC is 100,000,000 sats. You'd have 20 billion people sharing 10,000,000,000,000 units. That's an average of 500 sats per human globally in this hypo. Let's say they agree to hard fork and add 3 zeros. (Note: adding zeros doesn't change Jack shit here, okay). Adding zeros to the right side of the decimal point doesn't make the number go up or down.

There are canonical bridges that lock funds on Ethereum L1, and mint the corresponding iou tokens on L2 (or a sidechain). If such a bridge is hacked the backing of the iou tokens may be stolen, and the tokens on the L2 or sidechain may become worthless. It doesn't make any difference if you personally used such a bridge or not.

And their are multiple cross layer/chain liquidity bridges, like Hop, Celer and I think Across are. Those don't mint or lock tokens, but provide liquidity on both sides of the bridges, and are a usually fast and cheap way to enter or exit the sidechain or L2. If such a bridge is hacked the backing of the tokens is not in danger, and it's usually the liquidity provider that takes the loss, and possibly users that are using the bridge while it's under attack.

This is the most common nonsense I hear about PoW vs PoS. Can we please address it?

If I have $100 and want to get into Bitcoin mining what will be able to earn? Probably nothing right? 

What about if I have $10,000,000? I'd be able to take advantage of economies of scale when buying hardware, set up in property near a source of cheap electricity, etc. I'd make a much bigger return per dollar invested.

On the other hand... If I have $100 to put into Ethereum PoS, what will I be able to earn? About 4%.

If I have $10,000,000 to put into it, what could I expect to earn? About 4%.

Everything results in the rich getting richer, but with PoW the poor get nothing, whereas at least with PoS the poor get proportionally the same as the rich do.

How do you prevent this? I'm not sure it's possible without a big change of the infrastructure. You'd need nodes to prove they've seen a pending transaction and that such pending transaction can only be included into a block if enough nodes have seen it. 

The inevitable drawback is that it would increase the minimum delay between requesting a transaction and transaction finality.

To me, it's not worth it, even more so when you realize that, if it's a problem, it's only because it could be a money laundering attempt. But if so, it also means it's a failed laundering money attempt: a successful one isn't easily spotted by random people and forever written on a public ledger available from anywhere."	3e9ec6cb631dd588445e39ad4a67b0e07d89ed80	True	False					0	1659528946		0	{}	iirtmhq	False	t3_wf4xgp	False	True	t3_wf4xgp	/r/ethereum/comments/wf4xgp/is_it_possible_to_pay_to_a_specific_miner/iirtmhq/	1659528961	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_13pqgo	False	False		easy way to reproduce you send your pending transaction only to this miner and ensure the miner doesn t send it to anyone else which is expected when the miner s tip is noticeably higher than market offer like more than one eth is more than enough or when there s collusion how do you prevent this i m not sure it s possible without a big change of the infrastructure you d need nodes to prove they ve seen a pending transaction and that such pending transaction can only be included into a block if enough nodes have seen it the inevitable drawback is that it would increase the minimum delay between requesting a transaction and transaction finality to me it s not worth it even more so when you realize that if it s a problem it s only because it could be a money laundering attempt but if so it also means it s a failed laundering money attempt a successful one isn t easily spotted by random people and forever written on a public ledger available from anywhere 	0.0027012943755835295	0.9875773191452026	0.4085841178894043	0.02674868144094944	0.009026666171848774	0.3405742943286896	0.0907844826579094	8.371950457330968e-07	0.2928990125656128	0.019857028499245644

I conceptualize/understand a smart contract as a program presumably encoded on the blockchain that takes inputs from the blockchain and outputs new stuff onto the blockchain

That's my conception, so what really is a smart contract? Where does it take inputs from, and where do outputs go?

Where is the computer smart contracts actually, IRL, execute on?

+ every miner's CPU
+ some other distributed network of CPUs
+ one central CPU

Does standing up an ethereum miner, imply standing up a CPU to execute smart contracts?

Is there any reason to think two smart contract CPUs can differ in the outcome?

Additionally, this was not a mistake made by the Solana team, and they could not have prevented this incident.

In fact, this same type of hack could occur if I created my own brand new web wallet with an encryption bug, and then told everyone to use it. Anyone could do that. None of the Solana devs would have anything to do with it.

Moreover, this type of exploit could occur with any web wallet, not just wallets that are used for Solana. It could happen to Metamask if it relied on compromised code or faulty encryption logic.

So while the average user might think “Solana was hacked,” the fact is they are just wrong. That’s not what happened. Will their ignorance affect the price of SOL? Maybe. If it does, then perhaps that’s a great opportunity to buy the dip, because you happen to know better."	e94de25062b2cd722c2e844bdbc95dacffc006fa	True	False					0	1659512532		0	{}	iir6xh5	False	t3_weu607	False	True	t1_iir0px9	/r/solana/comments/weu607/strange_transfer/iir6xh5/	1659512542	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_n9cqo	False	True		well the difference exists and it matters regardless of whether people know it or not if you are using the recommended security process then your funds are safe additionally this was not a mistake made by the solana team and they could not have prevented this incident in fact this same type of hack could occur if i created my own brand new web wallet with an encryption bug and then told everyone to use it anyone could do that none of the solana devs would have anything to do with it moreover this type of exploit could occur with any web wallet not just wallets that are used for solana it could happen to metamask if it relied on compromised code or faulty encryption logic so while the average user might think solana was hacked the fact is they are just wrong that s not what happened will their ignorance affect the price of sol maybe if it does then perhaps that s a great opportunity to buy the dip because you happen to know better 	0.00242709182202816	0.9901279807090759	0.8525601029396057	0.016782380640506744	0.007403375115245581	0.5735050439834595	0.05539447441697121	8.386685976802255e-07	0.30057454109191895	0.019612297415733337

From my understanding, the security has less to do with Solflare (although that might be a factor) and more to do with the fact that you’re using a hardware wallet to sign transactions. I think it might have been a compromised code library that is scraping devices for private keys. It could also be a faulty encryption algorithm in the code.

Unfortunately, because of all of that, I did not save any links in the moment to any sources for stuff unrelated to Solana, as I have been mainly focused on dealing with the aftermath of this incident on Solana. However, I do know that I saw many reports many hours ago about this incident happening on Ethereum, which led to the origin of the prevalent theories about key/signing libraries implemented across wallets being the source of the issue.
