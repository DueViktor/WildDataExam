I will be rewarding up to 15 bitcoins to those who help me, if it's not a scam!

In the beginning of this month I received an email with an access to an account in coincrow.net and ignored it, yesterday I remembered the account and tried to access and got it, it has an amount of 50.8719 BTC.
I tried to withdraw to my Binance account and asked to test the network with 0.0004 BTC and to my surprise the deposit was successfully made.

When trying to make the final withdrawal the following image appears: ""savePro™ Activated:
The requested withdrawal amount is lower than your portfolio minimum withdrawal settings.
To help you save, you specified a minimum withdrawal limit of 50,912 BTC during creation of your portfolio.
Ensure your withdrawal is greater/equal to the set amount.
NOTE: This configuration cannot be disabled or adjusted after portfolio creation.""
Therefore, a minimum deposit of 0.0401 BTC is required to make a withdrawal.

Therefore, I would like to reward anyone who helps me with this deposit, with up to 15 BTC! Pay attention:
1. It can be an amazing opportunity, but it has high risk!
2. You can lose the amount deposited and get nothing in return, if it's a scam, but if it's not the reward is high!
3. If you are the only one to deposit 0.0401 you will get 15BTC, if it's 0.0201 you will get 7.5 BTC and if it's 0.0101 you will get 3.5 BTC, but if it's a scam you will get nothing and will not be refunded! Know the risks.
4. If you are interested send me an email jhhames8884@gmail.com to talk about it.
5. Follow the post, here I will leave updated with payment confirmations or even to prove if it is a scam or not.
6. I am not responsible for your investment, but if it is a success and we manage to redeem the 50 BTC, you will be rewarded in good faith.

I will be rewarding up to 15 bitcoins to those who help me, if it's not a scam!

In the beginning of this month I received an email with an access to an account in coincrow.net and ignored it, yesterday I remembered the account and tried to access and got it, it has an amount of 50.8719 BTC.
I tried to withdraw to my Binance account and asked to test the network with 0.0004 BTC and to my surprise the deposit was successfully made.

When trying to make the final withdrawal the following image appears: ""savePro™ Activated:
The requested withdrawal amount is lower than your portfolio minimum withdrawal settings.
To help you save, you specified a minimum withdrawal limit of 50,912 BTC during creation of your portfolio.
Ensure your withdrawal is greater/equal to the set amount.
NOTE: This configuration cannot be disabled or adjusted after portfolio creation.""
Therefore, a minimum deposit of 0.0401 BTC is required to make a withdrawal.

Therefore, I would like to reward anyone who helps me with this deposit, with up to 15 BTC! Pay attention:
1. It can be an amazing opportunity, but it has high risk!
2. You can lose the amount deposited and get nothing in return, if it's a scam, but if it's not the reward is high!
3. If you are the only one to deposit 0.0401 you will get 15BTC, if it's 0.0201 you will get 7.5 BTC and if it's 0.0101 you will get 3.5 BTC, but if it's a scam you will get nothing and will not be refunded! Know the risks.
4. If you are interested send me an email jhhames8884@gmail.com to talk about it.
5. Follow the post, here I will leave updated with payment confirmations or even to prove if it is a scam or not.
6. I am not responsible for your investment, but if it is a success and we manage to redeem the 50 BTC, you will be rewarded in good faith.

My answer: There is, and that's why we fight every day for the Bitcoin revolution to succeed. We have no guarantees other than those given by the Bitcoin protocol.

But the guarantees of the Bitcoin protocol are incredible:

1. There will never be more than 21 million BTC in circulation
2. 10 minutes delay on average between the issuance of each block of transactions
3. An adjustment of the mining difficulty of the Bitcoin network every 2,016 mined blocks
4. A decrease in the reward given to miners for every 210,000 blocks issued
5. A consensus algorithm based on Proof-of-Work
6. Bitcoin is the most secure decentralized network in the world
7. A permanently available network (Uptime &gt; 99.985% since Bitcoin creation)
8. A never hacked network
9. The data of the Bitcoin Blockchain is immutable
10. The Bitcoin code is open source

If you follow me, you can see why we Bitcoiners are so excited about the Bitcoin revolution. The Bitcoin system is designed to give us hard money that cannot be censored by the powerful in the current system.

Bitcoin is a unit of wealth independent of the control of governments and central bankers. And this is where Bitcoin's potential for the future is incredible. That is why we cannot afford not to try to make the Bitcoin revolution a success.

In contrast, the current monetary and financial system is flawed by design. It is not fixable. It gives you a guarantee: that of a programmed collapse sooner or later. You can be sure that the value of fiat currencies will continue to fall over time.

And that alternative is Bitcoin."	you have no guarantee that bitcoin will be a success on the other hand you can be sure that the current system is flawed and not fixable you have to go to a better alternative and that is bitcoin some people tell me you have no guarantee that bitcoin will be a success my answer there is and that s why we fight every day for the bitcoin revolution to succeed we have no guarantees other than those given by the bitcoin protocol but the guarantees of the bitcoin protocol are incredible 1 there will never be more than 21 million btc in circulation 2 10 minutes delay on average between the issuance of each block of transactions 3 an adjustment of the mining difficulty of the bitcoin network every 2 016 mined blocks 4 a decrease in the reward given to miners for every 210 000 blocks issued 5 a consensus algorithm based on proof of work 6 bitcoin is the most secure decentralized network in the world 7 a permanently available network uptime gt 99 985 since bitcoin creation 8 a never hacked network 9 the data of the bitcoin blockchain is immutable 10 the bitcoin code is open source if you follow me you can see why we bitcoiners are so excited about the bitcoin revolution the bitcoin system is designed to give us hard money that cannot be censored by the powerful in the current system bitcoin is a unit of wealth independent of the control of governments and central bankers and this is where bitcoin s potential for the future is incredible that is why we cannot afford not to try to make the bitcoin revolution a success in contrast the current monetary and financial system is flawed by design it is not fixable it gives you a guarantee that of a programmed collapse sooner or later you can be sure that the value of fiat currencies will continue to fall over time under these conditions you owe it to yourself to find an alternative to protect the fruits of your labor and your future and that alternative is bitcoin 	0.0008912582998163998	0.9954500794410706	0.3387458920478821	0.9786917567253113	0.003933441359549761	0.021033689379692078	0.08262959867715836	8.504940751663526e-07	0.27712568640708923	0.002423894824460149

Example: A cursory look at the current low and how miners say they can afford 13k BTC applied to the block reward of 6.25 compared to the 2032 reward of just over .75 BTC means that we could extrapolate a 125k price per Bitcoin as a bottom price in the 2032-2036 cycle.

The potential of NFTs could be estimated when a picture of an ape was sold for millions of dollars. 

  

But why is there so much hype about NFTs?

* Rare and one of a kind -      There can never be two identical NFTs. Either of them has to be a      duplicate. There’s always one of a kind. Anything that is rare will      automatically be valuable.
* Owned by someone famous -      Sometimes, people buy an NFT just for the sole reason that it was owned by      someone famous at some point in time. Let’s say, there’s a t-shirt for $5,      and then there’s the same t-shirt whose price was $5, but it was owned by      Elon Musk. The first t-shirt is fungible, that is, it can be replaced by      another t-shirt. But, the second t-shirt isn’t fungible, it cannot be      traded for another $5 t-shirt, it will cost more than any other t-shirt.      And, Musk can sell it as an NFT, and people will buy it happily.
* They are viewed as      collectibles.
* When you buy an NFT, you      basically acquire the rights to that digital asset (NFT), and only you      have those exclusive rights to that asset.

  

In my opinion, NFTs have a lot of hidden potential, and that is evident from the prices they are getting sold at. But, at the same time, we can’t ignore the fact that it hasn’t been around for a long time, so investing in an NFT could be a little risky too. So, to be on the safe side, one could invest in an NFT according to the risk they are fine with taking."

There’s always the argument of “yeah that’s cause it's old and people already have their money on it” but this statement is completely inaccurate considering that to this day Ethereum keeps one receiving a ton of fresh new money and a ton of new users daily.

Arbitrum and Optimism are proof of that seeing how many people use them on a daily basis.

And zero-knowledge based L2s have also been doing an amazing job.

ZkSync already has a zkEVM testnet and they’re even being funded by ETH giants like BitDAO to create a DAO specific scaling solution just for them.

This means that people are still finding ways to make Ethereum work in their favor instead of leaving it for another chain.

But that's it. The Internet is certainly a huge technology rather than the blockchain. When the Internet appeared, many people wanted to create a world government through the Internet. At that time, there were many voices praising the emperor's new clothes. They cheered that the non-existent new clothes would unify the world. But now their voices are gone. The same situation is happening again due to the current emergence of blockchain. Blockchain appeared wearing the clothes worn by the emperor called the Internet again. The name of the new clothes is Blind Decentralization.

Plato divided the rule of the majority into democracy and mobocracy. How can the same governance be two completely opposite sides? So was Marx's communism. The world of labor warriors burning in the spirit of revolution could come or become a world of iron rice bowls. The results are well known. 

Democracy also works undesirably at the level below the developing countries. Permanently fall into the middle-income trap, unable to escape. Developmental dictatorship is needed in times like this. South Korea is the country that best proved this truth. The dictators of all developing countries are following South Korea's Park Chung-hee, praising him.

The modern democracies also previously lived under feudalism. It was the right political system at the time. But it's not right now. The reason is that the quality of the people and the economic and technical environment have improved to a level suitable for democracy. On the other hand, in areas where these conditions are not mature, democracy only promotes corruption. Developmental dictatorship was needed to eliminate this corruption, and South Korea achieved democracy and economic growth. Currently, Xi Jinping is also leading the Communist Party's dictatorship by accepting the case of South Korea as an absolute lesson. China is not yet a suitable country for democracy. China has to wait at least another 20 years. In the meantime, dictatorship is needed. Deng Xiaoping's suppression of Tiananmen was the right decision.

The same is true of the world of blockchain. Securities laws are unnecessary in a world where people are made up of Jesus. However, if blockchain and DeFi are introduced to Sodom and Gomorrah, the blockchain itself should be banned, not the degree of application of the securities law. The present reality is located somewhere in the middle. 

In the current situation, if I look into the coin and depi markets, it is more like Sodom and Gomorrah than heaven. The war situation is very unfavorable to blockchainers. We don't know when the U.S. Treasury Department will ban DeFi entirely, I.e., consider it as securities. If the Sodom and Gomorrah index becomes higher than they are now, they will step up their intervention, and if the index is lowered, they will ease regulations.

Eventually, only two paths remain. One is that as the Sodom and Gomorrah index fall, blockchainers naturally have a happy ending, and the other is to flee to a safe place to avoid attacks by securities laws. There is nothing we need to prepare for the former case. So the case we have to be prepared for is the latter situation. Even if the blockchain world becomes a mess with Sodom and Gomorrah, it is necessary to find a way to safely preserve the coins and tokens that blockchainers have now and further raise them to a higher value.

There may not be only one way around this issue. But so far, no one has been able to systematically explain this method. Satoshi is dead and Buterin is dozing off. That's why I'm shaking him up. It's already a bit late.

This issue is a very simple one. Technically, there is nothing new but trustlessness. It's all a fuss. Oil was discovered. This is a huge event. However, it is inappropriate to discuss oil political philosophy. Just as oil does not enable democracy or anarchism, neither does trustlessness enable them. Oil is oil and trustlessness is just trustlessness. Nothing more, nothing less. Permissionlessness and others are only relative concepts. The only thing that is absolute is the trustlessness.

Cryptography enabled electronic signatures, which created trustlessness. Now people don't have to trust anyone. Whether it is an order delivered through an ally messenger or order through an enemy spy, I can grasp the authenticity of the order by myself. This is enough. This is the solution to the Byzantine Generals’ Problem.

Unexpectedly, the ability of trustlessness was great. This is because it can make all the agents in charge of recording disappear from the world. Of course, the inability to solve the Oracle problem is a fatal weakness, but nonetheless, trustlessness exerts tremendous capabilities. Some once predicted that the advent of the Internet shopping malls would eliminate all B2B or B2C face-to-face businesses. However, the need for face-to-face counseling has not disappeared. Nevertheless, no one can deny the greatness of the convenience that Internet shopping malls now bring. The same is true of blockchain, namely trustlessness. It eliminates enormous inefficiencies and risks, albeit in part.

But that's it. The Internet is certainly a huge technology rather than the blockchain. When the Internet appeared, many people wanted to create a world government through the Internet. At that time, there were many voices praising the emperor's new clothes. They cheered that the non-existent new clothes would unify the world. But now their voices are gone. The same situation is happening again due to the current emergence of blockchain. Blockchain appeared wearing the clothes worn by the emperor called the Internet again. The name of the new clothes is Blind Decentralization.

Finity Touch will surprise the crypto community with its unique features and an already large but growing ecosystem.  \n\n\nThe team of Finity Touch is happy to present Finity Skills. Finity Skills is the first product of the Finity Touch Ecosystem, which will be available in October 2022. What makes this news even more extraordinary is that the company started the development of the product just in the summer. The amount and quality of the information invested in the product are exceptional. The team understands the value of knowledge about crypto and the Web 3.0 sphere, especially with the oncoming Bitcoin halving.  \n\n\nFinity Skills offers users more than just learning blockchain and the cryptocurrency market from scratch. After completing their education, some students will receive employment opportunities. The educational process is entirely online for their convenience.  \n\n\nThis product is suitable not only for crypto entrepreneurs planning to launch their projects during the next bull market cycle but also for crypto enthusiasts and traders. During the first several months, the reduced course price will be available for everyone; however, by the end of 2022, with the development of a platform, prices will rise.  \n\n\nAnd more products are coming soon!  \n\n\nStay tuned for some new unique products:  \n\n\nNFT PeopleX is an interactive NFT collection for future access to the Play-to-Earn game Planex Land with the most realistic economic model. By being an owner of such NFT, users automatically enter a Finity Token private sale whitelist.  \n\n\nFinity Pay is an online cryptocurrency exchange that the Finity Touch team will integrate into every ecosystem product. By concluding the strategic partnerships, it will also become a part of other industry-leading crypto projects. For example, users could use Visa and Mastercard to buy or sell cryptocurrencies, and many bonuses and even airdrops of project tokens!  \n\n\nFinity Token is a crypto token of the project and the primary payment mechanism of the Finity Touch ecosystem that ensures the development of all products. It is deflationary and programmed to grow together with ecosystem development, based on the Binance Smart Chain.  \n\n\nPlanex Land is the first play-to-earn blockchain game with a complete business cycle which, according to developers, can change the perception of the GameFi sector. Users can create their avatars and live their life in the metaverse. First come, first served, so stay in touch, and don’t forget to check the news on the official Finity Touch website or social media.  \n\n\nBy merging all parts of the ecosystem, developers plan to achieve effortless fiat deposits, seamless exchanges and payments. This way, many developers would attract new customers who have never used cryptocurrencies. As a result, the market is enormous, and the team of Finity Skills have a desire to scale the crypto market by providing simple but, at the same time, cutting-edge products.  \n\n\nBy the end of 2022, the world will witness the launch of several new crypto products. That is somewhat encouraging, considering how rarely this happens during the bear market, and this makes the release of Finity Skills, an educational product of such scale, even more valuable. Let’s hope the company releases all other products in the planned time, thus attracting new members to the crypto community.', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/cgff1uz8f9q91.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5c9bcd3aa36677c5fee612769bcc576daa32d2ec""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/cgff1uz8f9q91.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5c9bcd3aa36677c5fee612769bcc576daa32d2ec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PRESS RELEASE.

""We do not think your post will spark a fruitful conversation so it was removed.""

I sent the following message to the Moderator.

\---------------------------------

Hello Sir. I am not familiar with Reddit because I am a South Korean. So it's somewhat confusing. Two of my writings were recently removed.

I thought there would be no problem with the content of the articles, but maybe there is a reason I hadn't thought of before. So I thought hard about the reason.

I'm a person who has a critical view against excessive decentralization. Is this a problem? I think people don't like my attitude. Or did someone report that the above articles provide a way to launder money? I am rather a bitter opponent of money laundering. My writing is not intended at all. You'll know if you read it carefully.

I don't know why the posts were removed, so I'm confused what to write in the future. Will it be removed if I post something from now on? Then should I move to another subreddit?

I'd like to know at least vaguely why the the above posts were removed. That way, I can decide which direction I should go in the future.

Thank you in advance.

\--------------------------------

But there is no answer so far. Perhaps the Moderators are very busy. It would be impossible to answer all complaints and I understand their situation. In the end, the answer is not expected to come. I know that people in similar cases rarely get answers.

The problem is I don't know what I did wrong yet. The above two articles are almost identical in subject to many other articles I have posted on this subreditt so far. If so, I wonder if Moderator's action means that my writing will continue to be removed in the future. If that's the case, then I'm going to have to leave this place.

Opposing excessive decentralization is an idea that flows throughout all my articles. However, this is not the only reason to be banned. Then there must be some other reasons.

It is virtually impossible to write with the thought that my writing may be removed again, especially without knowing exactly what is wrong with my writing.

Please give me your opinion as to which part of my article conflicts with the policy of r/etherum. If it can be fixed, I will fix it, if it cannot be fixed, I will have to leave this place."

If it can be fixed, I will fix it, if it cannot be fixed, I will have to leave this place."	my two posts were recently removed the title is the justice platform and blind decentralization as you can feel from the title i have a critical view against excessive decentralization this is because excessive decentralization pursues unconditional permissionlessness which is the basis for tax evasion and money laundering the above two articles were aimed at preventing the recent attacks of the u s treasury department and the sec in the field of defi by pursuing proper decentralization not extreme decentralization in the blockchain in addition it contains the content of creating a new safe platform that does not conflict with the securities law and moving existing coin and token holders there and i said that all this work would be done by a person or group that is not related to me for example buterin or the ethereum foundation but the posts were removed the reason was as follows we do not think your post will spark a fruitful conversation so it was removed i sent the following message to the moderator hello sir i am not familiar with reddit because i am a south korean so it s somewhat confusing two of my writings were recently removed i thought there would be no problem with the content of the articles but maybe there is a reason i hadn t thought of before so i thought hard about the reason i m a person who has a critical view against excessive decentralization is this a problem i think people don t like my attitude or did someone report that the above articles provide a way to launder money i am rather a bitter opponent of money laundering my writing is not intended at all you ll know if you read it carefully i don t know why the posts were removed so i m confused what to write in the future will it be removed if i post something from now on then should i move to another subreddit i d like to know at least vaguely why the the above posts were removed that way i can decide which direction i should go in the future thank you in advance but there is no answer so far perhaps the moderators are very busy it would be impossible to answer all complaints and i understand their situation in the end the answer is not expected to come i know that people in similar cases rarely get answers the problem is i don t know what i did wrong yet the above two articles are almost identical in subject to many other articles i have posted on this subreditt so far if so i wonder if moderator s action means that my writing will continue to be removed in the future if that s the case then i m going to have to leave this place opposing excessive decentralization is an idea that flows throughout all my articles however this is not the only reason to be banned then there must be some other reasons it is virtually impossible to write with the thought that my writing may be removed again especially without knowing exactly what is wrong with my writing please give me your opinion as to which part of my article conflicts with the policy of r etherum if it can be fixed i will fix it if it cannot be fixed i will have to leave this place 	0.002462839474901557	0.989189624786377	0.8833964467048645	0.013466989621520042	0.9941768646240234	0.4199637472629547	0.06660005450248718	8.514647333868197e-07	0.20165231823921204	0.010021889582276344

Description copy and pasted:

Facebook tried to disrupt the world - and the world says ""no."" Facebook launched Libra in June 2019. Libra would be an international currency and payment system. It would flow instantly around the world by phone. It could even ""bank the unbanked."" But Libra would also make Facebook too big to control- and lead the way for Facebook's Silicon Valley fellows to swing the power of their money as they pleased. Facebook and their friends could work around any single country's rules. Libra could shake whole economies and Facebook would become the ""digital identity"" provider to the world. Governments looked at Libra - and saw another 2008 financial crisis in the making. Facebook's plan would have made the company even more entrenched - at the cost of broken economies worldwide; starting with toppling the US dollar.

""Libra Shrugged"" is the story of a bad idea.

Bio: David Gerard writes the cryptocurrency and blockchain news site Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain. He is the author of the 2017 book Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain: Bitcoin, Blockchain, Ethereum &amp; Smart Contracts and the 2020 book Libra Shrugged: How Facebook Tried to Take Over the Money. Until he reinstalled the laptop they were on, he was the proud owner of six Dogecoins. He remains a frequent, if occasionally annoyed, user of Facebook.

As well as being a crypto journalist, David also works as a Unix system administrator, where his job includes keeping track of exciting new technologies, and advising against the bad ones. He has also been an award-winning music journalist, and has blogged about music at Rocknerd.co.uk since 2001. He is a volunteer spokesman for Wikipedia, and for skeptical wiki RationalWiki.org.

Received these tokens that said to visit AAVE for an airdrop.  Four days later, someone managed to convert all of the tokens in that wallet (aWETH, SAND, CRV, cvxCRV) into ETH and then send it out.  I did not interact with/approve any contracts, although it is possible I visited the website.  Are there exploits out there that can steal keys from MetaMask?  I would never approve a contract that I wasn't intending to, and always adjust the approval amount to exactly what I plan to let it spend when I do.  I have never given my seed words out.  None of the transactions appear in my MetaMask client, but they do show up in tools like [zapper.fi](https://zapper.fi).

Pretty sure I got scammed somehow with a fake AAVE token/ad (txn 0x49dc6f919ba5890af961727a12eb966f90b2a8c6d4c757fd2fbefc0be0747cfb).  Received these tokens that said to visit AAVE for an airdrop.  Four days later, someone managed to convert all of the tokens in that wallet (aWETH, SAND, CRV, cvxCRV) into ETH and then send it out.  I did not interact with/approve any contracts, although it is possible I visited the website.  Are there exploits out there that can steal keys from MetaMask?  I would never approve a contract that I wasn't intending to, and always adjust the approval amount to exactly what I plan to let it spend when I do.  I have never given my seed words out.  None of the transactions appear in my MetaMask client, but they do show up in tools like [zapper.fi](https://zapper.fi).
