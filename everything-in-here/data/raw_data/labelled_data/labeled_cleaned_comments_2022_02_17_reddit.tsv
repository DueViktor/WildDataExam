0	[]		schmelf			[]				text	t2_5kwrbp1h	False	False	[]	I have a feeling you’re relatively new to hodling. Well first off, what I proposed isn’t DCA. Second how do you think OP will feel if they YOLO it all in right now and the price drops to 32k? All of a sudden they’re sitting on a $550 loss and not all newbies can stomach that. My strategy just brings some prudent risk management to the scenario, where they mitigate their downside risk. In this scenario if OP put 1/3rd in at 44000 and 2/3rds in at 35k, when btc goes down to 32k they’ll only be sitting on a $300 loss AND on the upside they only need btc to get to 38k to break even instead of 44k. It’s just math. Sure you can YOLO it all in and if you have a long enough time horizon (which is the only way to buy btc IMO) then none of what we’re saying right now matters anyways. Just getting the money in the market will work.				1645012816	{}	hx5v5bk	False	t3_stsstp	False	True	t1_hx5u4mp	/r/Bitcoin/comments/stsstp/how_would_you_invest_2000_usd_right_now/hx5v5bk/	1648347610.0	3	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj		0	[]														i have a feeling you re relatively new to hodling well first off what i proposed isn t dca second how do you think op will feel if they yolo it all in right now and the price drops to 32k all of a sudden they re sitting on a 550 loss and not all newbies can stomach that my strategy just brings some prudent risk management to the scenario where they mitigate their downside risk in this scenario if op put 1 3rd in at 44000 and 2 3rds in at 35k when btc goes down to 32k they ll only be sitting on a 300 loss and on the upside they only need btc to get to 38k to break even instead of 44k it s just math sure you can yolo it all in and if you have a long enough time horizon which is the only way to buy btc imo then none of what we re saying right now matters anyways just getting the money in the market will work 	0.0026947688311338425	0.9888589382171631	0.8586915731430054	0.02956366539001465	0.008772182278335094	0.350041925907135	0.06302706152200699	8.520398750988534e-07	0.1489144116640091	0.006976055912673473

Next week the LGBTQ community roll up with trucks and block bridges and demand the Canadian government fund a separate school system for LGBTQ students, *equal in funding* as the government spends on separate catholic schools across the country. 

No logic, reason or argument convinces them otherwise. 

The country is loosing hundreds of millions of dollars a day.

The LGBTQ blockade crawls on week after week and auto plants shut down.

Thousands are out of work.

You can go into any bar now without a mask, but they are all closed with nothing to serve thanks to supply chain problems.

Its spring and Trudeau let's them keep blocking bridges because they are non violent. Funding flows from foreign countries and Trudeau shruggs, the truckers were right.

A fag wearing ass less chaps and carrying a Canadian flag brings them more fuel.

If we fund the LGBTQ school system and give them billions *of you tax dollars"" they will *permit* trade and travel to resume. 

If we give the LGBTQ protestors what they want next we'll get a convoy from the meritimes complaining that restrictions on fishing have gone on too long, they want an end to conservation efforts and freedom to fish, where and when they want. They bring trucks and are non violent.

I don't think it's an exchange deposit address.

15TZqVN8GpZTwGe6f84GEvSXhnANCG75N2

This one likely deposited BTC to an exchange into address 347ZPCb7HKVW4hG9Ei9A1R4G1uUMB5RbQX, but I have this exchange not in my database. What I see is that 15TZqVN8GpZTwGe6f84GEvSXhnANCG75N2 received BTC from a paxful.com address. The exchange we're looking for received a lot of deposits from coinpayments.net addresses and sent a lot of withdrawals to paxful.com addresses but I cannot answer your question what exchange is behind.
