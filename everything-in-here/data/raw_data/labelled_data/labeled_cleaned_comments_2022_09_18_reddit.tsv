He had already established r/CryptocurrencyNZ but could not resist taking 'ownership' of NZBitcoin because of its nearly 10000 community offering such a rich opportunity to tout shitcoin for Easycrypto. 

Easycrypto itself is a non custodial broker that hold no cryptocurrency but simply acts as a middleman clipping the ticket of sales and purchases made via Binance and other offshore exchanges. They have a cosy relationship with the banking cartel that refuses to provide reliable banking to NZ exchanges who are forced to use intermediaries. 

The result is NZ is possibly the most obstructed Bitcoin market in the OECD with very high fees charged by Easycrypto who dominate the market and only minor competition from exchanges who operate in constant threat of losing banking access. It looks a lot like market capture and control by the banking cartel. 

Possibly open banking reforms (that the banks have been resisting for over a decade) might be pushed through in the next year and more competition could emerge, but the bankers cartel nominee ex boss of Easycrypto founder/CEO looks like he could win the election next year and if so the bankers cartel obstruction of Bitcoin in NZ is almost certain to continue, IMO."	e124338726a1ca1bf4f615c60650cf19b650993f	True	False					0	1663458902		0	{}	iov0okp	False	t3_xgfl6q	False	True	t1_iouqoec	/r/Bitcoin/comments/xgfl6q/trade_bitcoin_for_sushi_in_nelson_new_zealand/iov0okp/	1663458921	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]			the new mod was literally easycryptos first employee as a social media manager and since becoming an independent crypto promoter and social media operator still receives sponsorship and funding from easycrypto including payments for referrals he had already established r cryptocurrencynz but could not resist taking ownership of nzbitcoin because of its nearly 10000 community offering such a rich opportunity to tout shitcoin for easycrypto easycrypto itself is a non custodial broker that hold no cryptocurrency but simply acts as a middleman clipping the ticket of sales and purchases made via binance and other offshore exchanges they have a cosy relationship with the banking cartel that refuses to provide reliable banking to nz exchanges who are forced to use intermediaries the result is nz is possibly the most obstructed bitcoin market in the oecd with very high fees charged by easycrypto who dominate the market and only minor competition from exchanges who operate in constant threat of losing banking access it looks a lot like market capture and control by the banking cartel possibly open banking reforms that the banks have been resisting for over a decade might be pushed through in the next year and more competition could emerge but the bankers cartel nominee ex boss of easycrypto founder ceo looks like he could win the election next year and if so the bankers cartel obstruction of bitcoin in nz is almost certain to continue imo 	0.0024217995814979076	0.9890774488449097	0.7527156472206116	0.035904522985219955	0.00783540029078722	0.33935990929603577	0.0779610127210617	8.194151632778812e-07	0.3851590156555176	0.017817769199609756

Government projects of this scale allow for insane levels of grift where politicians and bureaucrats will cooperate only if they feel they're personally siphoning off a fair amount of the money.  For example, politician A will only allow/ lobby for the construction of the plant in his state if his wife's brother's construction firm is guaranteed a $50M contract to install portable toilets at one of the sites.  This leads to endless cycles of budget shortfalls and going back to the taxpayers for more funding.   Nuclear powerplant projects are so complicated that it's extremely hard to be sure of where the money actually goes, and whether or not reported expenditures are reasonable.  This is exactly why the political class wants them so much.

Even if the corruption/ financing issues surrounding nuclear power could somehow magically be straightened out there are also enormous safety concerns.  Where/ how do you store a waste product that will be cancer-causing for longer than the average human language will exist?  Oh yeah; science will fix it in the *future*! ! fuck off.

The fact that it requires energy/electricity &amp; time is part of what gives it value. If it didn't require work to create, why would it have value at all?

This part isn't quite right. The energy cost of mining is a sunk cost. If you spend $2 on electricity to mine $1 worth of BTC, that doesn't drive the price of BTC up. The only thing you've done is wasted a dollar. Likewise, if you use a more efficient process to mine $1 worth of BTC for only $0.50 worth of electricity, that doesn't drive the price of BTC down. The BTC price does determine how much miners are generally willing to spend on mining it, though.

The value of BTC is determined by the supply (which is on a fixed schedule, minus lost coins), usage demand, and investment demand. There couldn't be any usage demand before the coins had any value, so their initial value was determined by investors speculating about future usage demand."	194c6c69489e00b075dc1cc4f3f67af444dadd69	True	False					0	1663453017		0	{}	iouo0op	False	t3_xgkp0z	False	True	t1_iot6gj1	/r/Bitcoin/comments/xgkp0z/til_that_a_division_of_greenpeace_took_a_5m_bribe/iouo0op/	1663453035	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]			 gt when btc was new they were able to calculate the cost of the energy required to mine it which helped assign value for the first time the fact that it requires energy electricity amp time is part of what gives it value if it didn t require work to create why would it have value at all this part isn t quite right the energy cost of mining is a sunk cost if you spend 2 on electricity to mine 1 worth of btc that doesn t drive the price of btc up the only thing you ve done is wasted a dollar likewise if you use a more efficient process to mine 1 worth of btc for only 0 50 worth of electricity that doesn t drive the price of btc down the btc price does determine how much miners are generally willing to spend on mining it though the value of btc is determined by the supply which is on a fixed schedule minus lost coins usage demand and investment demand there couldn t be any usage demand before the coins had any value so their initial value was determined by investors speculating about future usage demand 	0.0025221991818398237	0.9882854223251343	0.4475175738334656	0.9496029019355774	0.009605690836906433	0.18493126332759857	0.13870501518249512	8.420859671787184e-07	0.4234466254711151	0.0031353856902569532
