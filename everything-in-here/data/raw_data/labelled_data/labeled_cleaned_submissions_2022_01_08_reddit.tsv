What has made a huge difference for me is to actually start experiment and building with Bitcoin and with Lightning in particular. Once you go down this rabbithole you'll actually learn what the Bitcoin network has to offer. I'll share with you some insights I have gotten so far and hopefully it inspires some of you to also start building

1. Lightning allows you to circumvent the banking system. Well duh.. But for hobbyist entrepreneurs like myself this is actually a big deal. Setting up a business bank-account is no easy task. Especially if you want to set up a small business to check market interest, being able to use a lightning address for payments is ideal and has allowed me to work on business ideas without the red tape of having to deal with institutions.
2. If you get yourself familiar witht he lightning CLI and you know a bit of Python you can already start doing interesting stuff that your average bank won't let you do. For instance automating refunds and payment forwarding. With just a few lines of code you can a payment processing business and make money on routing fees (given that payments need to be made in Bitcoin of course).
3. Last but not least I believe that an underexposed feature of the Bitcoin network are its nodes. I see nodes becoming much more than just for running the Bitcoin and Lightning software. They're basically a personal always-online server that offers a scalable solution for hosting decentralized applications. Where Ethereum for instance hosts its smart contracts on their basechain (which is hugely inefficient as every node needs to host a copy), bitcoin nodes allow for decentralized hosting of smart contracts and other applications on the nodes hardware. The difference being that only a relevant subset of the network has to run the smartcontract and that Bitcoin nodes can easily run by everyone. Use cases being things like self hosting your webshop, blogs, social media profile, videos, images and applications so you don't have to rely on software giants like Amazon, Youtube and Facebook anymore.

This is of course all far from reality, but I think this is where Bitcoin will have a huge advantage over many other blockchains and frankly where many other blockchains have made a huge mistake in choosing for a bloated basechain and a more centralized node system."

I am new in here and also lack full techinical understanding so forgive me for any mistakes in explanation but just take the gist of the idea. Also apologies if this was asked many times before.

Tldr/gist: What if US (or any country) comes with a bitcoin replica with exact same features of Bitcoin?

What if SEC Chairman invites for a press conference and says below:

Alright fellas, we give in. We now understand blockchain and crypto currencies are the future. Bitcoin has shown the world what it is capable of. It has shown how a blockchain innovation can be decentralised, secure and be a store of value for the entire humanity. We want to encourage and embrace the same but bitcoin already had its big run. As a state, we don't want to get in late. 

So here, we introduce ""BitcoinUS"". It will exactly be like Bitcoin. 

1. Same algorithm, same 21 million coins, same halving cycle of 4 years, same block rewards, same 100 million Satoshi sub units etc. 

2. We already have set up some nodes to mine and we give you all the core for you to download and run your nodes. It can be done in any country and I urge all countries to join in. 

3. BitcoinUS will be just like US dollar and will be a currency/valid tender in US as well as 65 other countries that uses USD today. 

4. All countries can use this as reserve.

5. It will still be decentralised just like Bitcoin. It will be uncensorable, unconfiscatible and can be self custodied just like Bitcoin.

6. All major exchanges that supports Bitcoin will support BitcoinUS too. 

So this new bitcoin replica comes with US support, comes as a valid tender in 65 countries, gets adopted by China, India and other big nations to build it's reserve, millions of people who missed bitcoin jumps in to buy this early....

I'm looking for an quick and easy way to buy Bitcoin in the UK.

I normally use [bcbitcoin.co.uk](https://bcbitcoin.co.uk) but its become apparent that im getting shafted by their fees (4%)

The way I see the dilemma of BTC's inability to handle more than (7) transactions per second vs. Visa's ability of 24,000 transactions per second; am I wrong to believe this with regard to the Lightning network?

My understanding is this using United Airlines as an example:

UAL opens a node on the Lightning Network and offers BTC users the ability to purchase tickets with their Sats.

Customer (1) wants to buy a ticket using BTC

UAL's node recognizes that there are enough Sats in the transaction to complete the ticket purchase.

Multiply this transaction by several thousand per day.

These transactions can be proved and agreed on using ""Proof of Stake"" for UAL's node.

After a day or two or weekly the Combined BTC transactions move to the BTC Blockchain as ""one"" transaction and continues on the blockchain as ""Proof of Work.""

**FOR THOSE THAT DONT WANT TO USE ID WHEN BUYING CRYPTO:**

LocalCoinSwap is by far the best P2P crypto exchange service in existence. It's low fees and permanent No-KYC status make it the only realistic site for people that want to stay fully off the grid, or simply just don't have the necessary documentation to identify themselves.

One thing that infuriated me with sites such as Binance, LocalBitcoin and Paxful, was that you could probably only make 1 or 2 trades if you were lucky, before they would need identification. LocalCoinSwap always keeps its integrity and stays KYC free at al times.

Did I mention ID isn't even required to sell crypto, which for me is unheard of.

Another benefit I found is the low-fees. The first ever time I bought BTC, I used Paxful. I bought £20 worth of BTC and guess what I ended up with; £13.00....

For small amounts of Crypto the fees on these sites can almost half your funds, now obviously this isn't completely the sites fault as sellers charge ridiculous amounts and should be held accountable too, however, I found the average above market value on LocalCoinSwap to be around 10% when on other sites it would average around 20-27%.

The fees on LocalCoinSwap's end are virtually non-existent, buying £20 worth of BTC will leave you with no less than £18, which in the P2P marketplace scene is just amazing. Same sacrifice you would make with the likes of Coinbase.

I hope this post can help some fellow KYC haters not get completely ripped off on their hard earned crypto.

It is somewhat ""accepted"" to mock people who sold Bitcoin early (in 2011 etc). But they had no knowledge of what this could become.

I think that hodling Bitcoin was the easiest between 2013-current date. You had some price history to go by, and at the same time you could expect moon every 4 years. This period has now ended and we are again in uncharted waters that the OGs in 2011 faced.

A couple months ago, I posted in here about my brother considering selling his bitcoin, as he was almost out of cash and temporarily out of work. There were some great suggestions in the comments of that post, which were very much appreciated, such as offering to loan him cash and I'd hold onto his bitcoin until he can pay me back, or for him to sell his initial stake and hold onto profit.

He didn't want to take a loan from me, as he didn't want to be in my debt, which I understand. He started by selling his initial stake, leaving the profit in bitcoin. And yesterday he sold the rest of it, as he needed the cash. He does have a job now, but he needed the cash in the next few days. 

While it's disappointing that he sold all his bitcoin, I am happy he did it, because he completely sees bitcoin's use as a store of value/form of saving now. His original intention in buying bitcoin was to make a quick profit, like a lot of people who got into the market in 2021. He said to me when he was selling it that he ""would have spent all that money on shite"" if he hadn't bought the bitcoin, so he's glad he had held it in bitcoin, because he would have had nothing now if he hadn't bought bitcoin in the first place. He also said he will be buying more once he can afford to. Having made a profit on it, he has a positive outlook on it, as opposed to people who have sold at a loss, or haven't gotten the moon gains they thought they'd get. 

He had also bought shitcoins around the time he bought bitcoin, all of which are in a loss position. He is completely disillusioned by shitcoins now and is just waiting for them to breakeven/go slightly in the green to sell them off too. So when he does have the money to get back into investing, it will be in bitcoin and not shitcoins.

Is this possible for who ever maintains the code to do?

&amp;#x200B;

SENDING 

\-SPOTLIGHT function, if you put in an ADDRESS, you can shine spotlight to make sure that it is the right address you put in.  You get a string back acknowledging you are spotlighting the right recipient.     Sending BTC is so stressful especially when dealing with large amounts.  It always makes me crap my pants when I consider that I can loose my entire savings in a simple address mistake.

INACTIVITY

\-After 3 years of inactivity, a field where by you can put in an email and recover your BTC.   You get a warning every year that in 24 months, 12 months, that there has been no activity and the recovery clause will be thrown if this persist longer than 3 years.

Every single one of us could be in a car crash tomorrow, or a natural disaster or a fire where our BTC access gets wiped out.   Even hit by a bus, and our families are out of luck.  This would be a NEXT of KIN function that could be turned on or off by the user if they wish.  

CUSTODY

\-key aliases, that you can create and delete at your will.  This will help with business custody.   You can create lets say 3 aliases that are not the real key, but function as the key for as long as you allow it.   Hence in order to do a send 3 separate people need to approve the send with their alias-key .Hence custody can be maintained by organizations with 3 managers having to sign off on the transaction.   If one of them is let go or fired, you delete the entry and nothing lost, you add a new replacement and viola.  Chain of custody maintained no one needs to know main key other than the owner.  Also if the owner makes alias for him/herself that means they need to sing off/approve the transaction with the input of their alias-key

This will make it way more business/institution friendly. 

This is where I think BTC is the weakest from an institution and business point of view.  One bad actor can pull off the heist of a century with a button click.  A country like El Salvador can be robbed in one move, hopefully they have many wallets, but from my understanding none of these people have self custody including Michael Saylor, they trust 3rd parties to do their custody and that is incredibly weak and prone to bad apples spoiling the party. 

Institutional self custody needs this bad!

I’m loving to see all that grief and terror in the market… because my only focus is accumulating satoshis.. what matters more is reaching that number at the left side of the point (Did you get my point, right ?) and with a bear market I can see my fiat currency worthing more in reference of buying more satoshis to achieve that mark of whole BTC. I would say that one of the biggest regrets of middle and old adopters of crypto is not buying more when BTC where hoarding around 3-6k in 2018. 

With the crypto winter extending for a while, also blockchain technology would have time to develop and show the world all the innovation it brings granting more adoption.

So basically I have an account manager which sorted out when to buy and sell after i gave the deposit to the account manager

Then after a while the profit was sent to bitcoinxchane.live where they then requested a deposit since its a new account and then they were transacting the profits but said it reversed back onto my wallet on their platform.

So they said in order to continue the transaction they will need me to get a BITCOIN PROFILE and mentioned that if it wasn't created it will keep reversing back due to it being a decent amount. 

They said the company will create it for me but at the cost of £4870...

The account manager said ""Like a private medium registered with your name on the block chain transaction platform. Where all bitcoins transaction goes through""

But in all the research i done in asking how to get a bitcoin profile (cause i was trying to find out another way instead of paying £4870) but nothing came up apart from bitcoin wallets. But the manager states that's different from a profile.

If this is true is there another way to create a bitcoin profile?

I imagine a lot of people would imagine this would be better suited to r/cryptocurrency.  The reason I won’t post this their is that the vast majority of the active users on that sub care very little about decentralization and are firmly in the “blockchain not bitcoin” camp.  I think users here are much more interested in decentralization as a worthy goal, but if this strays too far from the topic of bitcoin to be here I get it.  No worries.

So platforms like Minds.con are supposed to be decentralized alternatives to platforms like facebook, but I fail to understand what exactly makes them decentralized.  

From what I can tell it’a just another private company using blockchain technology for some sort of end product, in this case an alternative for facebook, that pays people some tokens for doing some task.

In what way is this decentralized?  Is the data still not just stored in some central database?  Is the platform, and the content, not still ultimately just determined by the company? Even if you subscribe to the “decentralization is a spectrum” argument it is hard to see how this, or any other supposed decentralized social platform, is meaningfully decentralized.

Is there anyone actually trying to make a platform that is truly decentralized?  Is anyone even theorizing how that could be possible?

To me one of the most important things that would make a decentralized social network would be data storage.  There would be some sort of incentive system like mining in bitcoin where individuals could contribute memory in exchange for some reward.  All of the data would be distributed across these different nodes so no individual could arbitrarily censor another.  Of course this would limit how much data individual users could post.  I imagine it would have to be text only for a long time.

Any thoughts on this?  I apologize if this has been posted or discussed before ad nauseam.

Is it even possible?"	decentralized social media i apologize ahead of time if this is the wrong place to post this i imagine a lot of people would imagine this would be better suited to r cryptocurrency the reason i won t post this their is that the vast majority of the active users on that sub care very little about decentralization and are firmly in the blockchain not bitcoin camp i think users here are much more interested in decentralization as a worthy goal but if this strays too far from the topic of bitcoin to be here i get it no worries so platforms like minds con are supposed to be decentralized alternatives to platforms like facebook but i fail to understand what exactly makes them decentralized from what i can tell it a just another private company using blockchain technology for some sort of end product in this case an alternative for facebook that pays people some tokens for doing some task in what way is this decentralized is the data still not just stored in some central database is the platform and the content not still ultimately just determined by the company even if you subscribe to the decentralization is a spectrum argument it is hard to see how this or any other supposed decentralized social platform is meaningfully decentralized is there anyone actually trying to make a platform that is truly decentralized is anyone even theorizing how that could be possible to me one of the most important things that would make a decentralized social network would be data storage there would be some sort of incentive system like mining in bitcoin where individuals could contribute memory in exchange for some reward all of the data would be distributed across these different nodes so no individual could arbitrarily censor another of course this would limit how much data individual users could post i imagine it would have to be text only for a long time any thoughts on this i apologize if this has been posted or discussed before ad nauseam tl dr are there any really decentralized social networks in existence or being worked on is it even possible 	0.002473205327987671	0.9885879755020142	0.5687679052352905	0.010610505938529968	0.008883081376552582	0.5394431352615356	0.06507270783185959	8.512041063113429e-07	0.5038799047470093	0.00985708087682724

It states that the global wealth is 418 342 billion dollar ( in 2021, page 7, table 1 in the Global wealth report 2021 PDF )so $418 342 000 000 000.

There are 21 000 000 bitcoin out there ( I know that there are lost coins already) .

So 418 342 billion dollar / 21 million bitcoins means that around 19 million dollar bitcoin price the sum of bitcoin price equals the global household wealth on the Earth. In this case the bitcoin owners stating that they own everything on the planet Earth. Even a 10 million dollar bitcoin price means that bitcoin holders owns half the Earth.

So based on the above I think the current theoretical limit on bitcoin price is around 19 million dollar.

Or not? Is there any flaw in this calculation or thinking process? What do you think?"

For unimportant reasons I had like 4 wallets and only needed one. Now I'm just checking to make sure non of the wallets I want to get rid of have ether or testnet ether bc that's also tedious to get now. At that moment I saw that I Account 4 had ether in it. Only 0.0005, but still I can't remember this transaction. Than I looked at it on etherscan and see that at one point the wallet had 13 ether in it. I know for a fact that this is not my wallet. Also it has transactions dating back to times where I didn't know about crypto.  
I only imported the wallet to see if you can just import a random wallet using a random private key when I didn't know a lot about crypto. When I did that and imported the wallet I did the math and came to the conclusion that there are waaaay to many possible wallets to find one that holds ether.  
Also I just checked the private address and I can confirm that I made the private key. How is this possible? The chance of this happening is so small that something else must be going on right?

I was just looking through my wallets because I wanted to clean them up. For unimportant reasons I had like 4 wallets and only needed one. Now I'm just checking to make sure non of the wallets I want to get rid of have ether or testnet ether bc that's also tedious to get now. At that moment I saw that I Account 4 had ether in it. Only 0.0005, but still I can't remember this transaction. Than I looked at it on etherscan and see that at one point the wallet had 13 ether in it. I know for a fact that this is not my wallet. Also it has transactions dating back to times where I didn't know about crypto.  
I only imported the wallet to see if you can just import a random wallet using a random private key when I didn't know a lot about crypto. When I did that and imported the wallet I did the math and came to the conclusion that there are waaaay to many possible wallets to find one that holds ether.  
Also I just checked the private address and I can confirm that I made the private key. How is this possible? The chance of this happening is so small that something else must be going on right?

I did and I was able to get EURs from my bank to USDC on polygon for 0.2% fees from curve. This beats my previous methods of binance matic -&gt; polygon and and crypto.com eth -&gt; arbitrum, which both incurred about 1% of fees.

The chain of events looks like this:
EUR sepa to Pelerin (free),
Pelerin EUR -&gt; polygon jEUR (free, wtf!),
jEUR -&gt; eurt on curve (0.04% fee),
eurt -&gt; usdc on curve (0.14% fee)

so I ended with 99.8% of my initial fiat bank EUR in USDC on polygon. Feels great.

The only downside is that the bank transfer took 1 day and pelerin took another 2 days to get jEUR to polygon (support cites high polygon gas fees lol).

Now, and this would be pretty sweet, they claim that they offer the same route from crypto to fiat. I will try that out and let you know, but getting from USDC to EUR in my bank for 0.2% would be crazy offramp too.

Also, they seem to supprot pretty much all L1s and L2s.

Anybody sees any holes in my reasoning or some shady stuff on Pelerin we should know about?"	a new l2 onramp without fees a few days ago i talked on ethfinance about trying out https www mtpelerin com i did and i was able to get eurs from my bank to usdc on polygon for 0 2 fees from curve this beats my previous methods of binance matic gt polygon and and crypto com eth gt arbitrum which both incurred about 1 of fees the chain of events looks like this eur sepa to pelerin free pelerin eur gt polygon jeur free wtf jeur gt eurt on curve 0 04 fee eurt gt usdc on curve 0 14 fee so i ended with 99 8 of my initial fiat bank eur in usdc on polygon feels great the only downside is that the bank transfer took 1 day and pelerin took another 2 days to get jeur to polygon support cites high polygon gas fees lol now and this would be pretty sweet they claim that they offer the same route from crypto to fiat i will try that out and let you know but getting from usdc to eur in my bank for 0 2 would be crazy offramp too also they seem to supprot pretty much all l1s and l2s anybody sees any holes in my reasoning or some shady stuff on pelerin we should know about 	0.0024738877546042204	0.9884222149848938	0.7528266310691833	0.024824921041727066	0.0081185819581151	0.43864700198173523	0.09694667160511017	8.513802640663926e-07	0.3326692283153534	0.009559494443237782

Greetings Everyone! 

I just posted a new article on my blog highlighting some of the most common crypto scams that I've seen and experienced in the last year. It's long but pretty detailed. I cover how the attack looks, how you could respond to the attack, and what you can do to prevent falling victim to these scams. Check it out and share to raise awareness!

What less people realize is the other side of that equation: Physical items that behave as if they are digital.

Let me illustrate...  


**Turing Completenes**

NFT's are universally programable via smart contracts.

Whatever functionality you can program into a normal app, NFT's can do in principle.

This universality allow NFT shape shift into many things simultaneously not just one thing at a a time.  


**Combinatory**

Each individual NFT can be combined with other NFTs to create a complete picture and unlock all sorts of features/rewards.

Imagine you have to collect or pool (via DAO) 20 NFTs to turn them into a clue for the next airdrop.  


**Transmorphability**

NFTs can be programmed with emergent functionality.

Imagine a collection of generative artworks that looks and behave one way individually but when you own 5 of them changes into something completely different. (Think Megazord from Power Rangers )  


**Daisy Chaining**

NFT's can have conditions built which have to be met to unlock access to other NFT's.

This allow you to create anything from murder mysteries, to treasure hunts, to level creation (Scientologists rejoice) and any progressive certification fully automated.  


**Derivative**

u/lootproject showed us that you can even turn everything on its head by providing abstract idea NFT's (called loot backs) and then have a community build a whole universe around them using derivatives called synthetic Loot as the incentive structure.

We haven't even begun to scratch the surface of what is possible.

Only imagination, experiments and the law of computation sets the limits for what is possible.

I haven't been as excited about the prospect of anything since the early days of the internet."

In fact I urge you not to buy into any! This is just me putting out my thoughts, and these are simply examples.*

I was looking at how the Cops Game turned out yesterday. It's almost an exact copy of Wolf Game on Ethereum, which got highly successful and made some people a lot of money. The concept is amazing (although haven't followed it closely) and it seems that Cops Game is pretty much an exact replica, with huge demand from the people. The NFT drop yesterday went pretty rough because it was botted as hell, but that's a problem caused by the project's creator. Demand is there though.

One huge point though is that playing any game on Ethereum is wildly expensive due to the high gas fees. Ethereum games have been highly successful even in the face of this. IMHO, games have a huge opportunity on Solana because they are simply cheap to play. If Cops Game is any indicator of this, we can see a lot more (maybe copycat) games popping up on Solana and performing well. When CryptoKitties launched in 2017, they also congested the Eth network pretty bad, again an issue that Solana could potentially handle a lot better. Polygon had the same issue with Sunflower Farm just the other day. I think that was the first time Polygon experienced that kind of load, their first rodeo.

Having said that, are there actually playable games on Solana already? Have you tried some? What has been your experience? Both games that are actually fun to play, or ones heavily leaning on the GameFi side. Would love to hear your opinion, and please correct me if I made wrong assumptions or had bad info.

Kusama provides the same promises as Polkadot and behold, it comes with no promises! A heterogeneous multi-chain platform that uses a Nominated Proof of Stake(NPoS) consensus, with on-chain governance, and forkless runtime upgrades. It is known as the canary network for Polkadot and has been called a “value bearing test network” by Gavin Wood. At its core, Kusama is a blockchain network that shares an almost identical code base with Polkadot, with the caveat that it might be slightly more advanced since code gets tested first on Kusama and vetted before moving onto Polkadot; the slight differences in parameters make it a good testing ground. For example, [this](https://polkadot.network/blog/grandpa-equivocation-and-sysinfo-process-collection-results-in-slashing-on-kusama-network-a-post-mortem/) postmortem of when a slashing bug was found on Kusama and fixed before it could impact Polkadot. As the slogan goes “Expect Chaos”. The Kusama community tends to be a bit more developer focused, and smaller than Polkadots.

**Functionality differences between Kusama and Polkadot**

There are runtime differences that make Kusama more conducive to testing out features. In general Kusama is 4x as fast as Polkadot. This allows for an environment where runtime changes and parachain features can be tested “quicker”. Not everything is 4x as fast, for instance the block time and speed of which the chain grows is the same, at 6 seconds per block. Some of the main differences:

The 4x faster environment allows for more experimentation, such as the ability to pass new runtime upgrades quicker, this requires diligence from the participants to stay up to date. 

**Testing in the world of blockchains \
**The main reason we need Kusama is that Web 3.0 functionality has high stakes due to blockchains' monetary aspect. It is important to note that testing features of blockchain networks is not as straightforward as features of Web 2.0 applications. Failed features of blockchain technologies can lead to large financial losses. The Ethereum DAO [story](https://news.coinsquare.com/blockchain/the-dao-how-a-failed-project-may-still-impact-the-world/) is a perfect example, where a smart contract was drained of $150 million worth of ETH. In Web 2.0 applications, testing a feature can be as easy as putting it on a test server where it can be confirmed to work, before it is released into production. This effort can take anywhere between a couple minutes to a day or two, depending on the size of the feature. Blockchains however, have a few aspects that make testing more difficult. Blockchains are heavily game theoretic; the behavior of participants are incentivized through value bearing tokens(cryptocurrencies). If for some reason a runtime upgrade contains some gameable bug, this can be difficult to foresee, and could take the malicious participant a while to find. Hence to really test changes to code, we need a network where real value is being used, and there we can find such errors. Kusama acts as that value bearing network, so that when a piece of functionality is tested and the code is audited, we can be more certain of its validity before putting it on Polkadot.

**As of now**

It is interesting to see that the canary paradigm of Kusama also reflects in the parachains deployed on it. Projects in the Polkadot ecosystem tend to test their functionalities on their respective Kusama parachain first and then plan to deploy them on their Polkadot parachain.

Polkadot and Kusama are both running smoothly and are onboarding parachains. Kusama has 16+1 and Polkadot has 5+1, the +1 being Statemine and Statemint, the common-good parachains deployed and maintained by the team at Parity. To learn more about Kusama checkout the [guide](https://guide.kusama.network/). Check out all the parachains on Kusama [here](https://parachains.info/#!). Kusama has funded 72,590KSM to proposals through its Treasury so far, including a few chain state scanners like Subscan and Polkascan, as well as wallets like Fearless and Polkawallet.

The 4x faster environment allows for more experimentation, such as the ability to pass new runtime upgrades quicker, this requires diligence from the participants to stay up to date. 

**Testing in the world of blockchains \
**The main reason we need Kusama is that Web 3.0 functionality has high stakes due to blockchains' monetary aspect. It is important to note that testing features of blockchain networks is not as straightforward as features of Web 2.0 applications. Failed features of blockchain technologies can lead to large financial losses. The Ethereum DAO [story](https://news.coinsquare.com/blockchain/the-dao-how-a-failed-project-may-still-impact-the-world/) is a perfect example, where a smart contract was drained of $150 million worth of ETH. In Web 2.0 applications, testing a feature can be as easy as putting it on a test server where it can be confirmed to work, before it is released into production. This effort can take anywhere between a couple minutes to a day or two, depending on the size of the feature. Blockchains however, have a few aspects that make testing more difficult. Blockchains are heavily game theoretic; the behavior of participants are incentivized through value bearing tokens(cryptocurrencies). If for some reason a runtime upgrade contains some gameable bug, this can be difficult to foresee, and could take the malicious participant a while to find. Hence to really test changes to code, we need a network where real value is being used, and there we can find such errors. Kusama acts as that value bearing network, so that when a piece of functionality is tested and the code is audited, we can be more certain of its validity before putting it on Polkadot.

**As of now**

It is interesting to see that the canary paradigm of Kusama also reflects in the parachains deployed on it. Projects in the Polkadot ecosystem tend to test their functionalities on their respective Kusama parachain first and then plan to deploy them on their Polkadot parachain.

Polkadot and Kusama are both running smoothly and are onboarding parachains. Kusama has 16+1 and Polkadot has 5+1, the +1 being Statemine and Statemint, the common-good parachains deployed and maintained by the team at Parity. To learn more about Kusama checkout the [guide](https://guide.kusama.network/). Check out all the parachains on Kusama [here](https://parachains.info/#!). Kusama has funded 72,590KSM to proposals through its Treasury so far, including a few chain state scanners like Subscan and Polkascan, as well as wallets like Fearless and Polkawallet.

usp sharing kusama provides the same promises as polkadot and behold it comes with no promises a heterogeneous multi chain platform that uses a nominated proof of stake npos consensus with on chain governance and forkless runtime upgrades it is known as the canary network for polkadot and has been called a value bearing test network by gavin wood at its core kusama is a blockchain network that shares an almost identical code base with polkadot with the caveat that it might be slightly more advanced since code gets tested first on kusama and vetted before moving onto polkadot the slight differences in parameters make it a good testing ground for example this https polkadot network blog grandpa equivocation and sysinfo process collection results in slashing on kusama network a post mortem postmortem of when a slashing bug was found on kusama and fixed before it could impact polkadot as the slogan goes expect chaos the kusama community tends to be a bit more developer focused and smaller than polkadots functionality differences between kusama and polkadot there are runtime differences that make kusama more conducive to testing out features in general kusama is 4x as fast as polkadot this allows for an environment where runtime changes and parachain features can be tested quicker not everything is 4x as fast for instance the block time and speed of which the chain grows
