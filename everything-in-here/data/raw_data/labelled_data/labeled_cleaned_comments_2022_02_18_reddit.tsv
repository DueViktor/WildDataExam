Bitcoin can be used by ALL, but can't be manipulated by ANY, even by those who worship and use It.
Even if any government fail or succeed in doing so, they are already failing because there is no way out.

Thank you so much for your long reply.

\-The Tax thing: I did my research and crypto is very weird when it comes to taxes. My understanding so far: Germany treats crypto pretty much like a Watch, Sneakers or Art that increase in value over time. Holding this type of investment for a year makes it tax free. Using this to gain money by lending it changes it's tax status. At the very moment I decide to stake my coins and click on the staking button, I have to expect to pay full 45% tax on both coins and staking rewards. It becomes both tax free 10 years after I initially bought the coins. 

\-The mSOL thing: It sounds good (even though the chart looks just like a ponzi scheme) but it just adds another party that I see as a risk factor besides me not knowing anything about neither mSOL, marinade finance, the validators or the technical ongoing behind staking. I read through the marinade info sheet and it just gives me off ponzi/pyramide scheme vibes ([https://docs.marinade.finance/marinade-dao/contributors#work-groups-details](https://docs.marinade.finance/marinade-dao/contributors#work-groups-details)). 

Maybe I got some things wrong but I don't really see the point of staking mSol over SOL.

I still hope that marinade is legit and I will follow their path and watch out if there is an oppurtunity for me to use it.

Unfortunately in this case I think the reputation might be negative for the polkadot as well. I’m not sure what and how will that happen, but something to consider. Another thing might be parachain auctions - higher bidder wins, that means its vulnerable to big money eating small players, but that assumes polka dot will be huge and being there would be privilige. Another is polka dot governence, as in every democracy its vulnerable to masses I believe. So if you try to force some stupid or breaking change into the system it might be possible thanks to stupidity of voters, but Im not sure tbh where votes come from, imo its something controlled by polkadot authorities for now. Tldr in my opinion every flaw in democracy and monopol can be applied to polka dot as well + any other blockchain issues in some sort of variation. Not many obvious one though, like eth high gas fees etc.				1645121852	{}	hxc76nn	False	t3_suqbhv	False	True	t3_suqbhv	/r/Polkadot/comments/suqbhv/honest_question_about_dots_limitations/hxc76nn/		1	True	False	Polkadot	t5_2ublt		0	[]		False	de8b425d2ff8ecc86f89fde23627eac0373b981f	True	False		0.0		0.0	1645121866.0	False	r/Polkadot	public	i thought about the case where parachains project do something wrong or they fail to deliver unfortunately in this case i think the reputation might be negative for the polkadot as well i m not sure what and how will that happen but something to consider another thing might be parachain auctions higher bidder wins that means its vulnerable to big money eating small players but that assumes polka dot will be huge and being there would be privilige another is polka dot governence as in every democracy its vulnerable to masses i believe so if you try to force some stupid or breaking change into the system it might be possible thanks to stupidity of voters but im not sure tbh where votes come from imo its something controlled by polkadot authorities for now tldr in my opinion every flaw in democracy and monopol can be applied to polka dot as well any other blockchain issues in some sort of variation not many obvious one though like eth high gas fees etc 	0.0027213827706873417	0.9880785346031189	0.7017804980278015	0.017133262008428574	0.9939555525779724	0.4166029989719391	0.07998334616422653	8.311205874633742e-07	0.5152707695960999	0.002496276516467333
