The same kind of thing happened with gold. The first bankers were actually providing a gold storage service, where they would store the gold for their customers, and give them a receipt for it. Other people could accept these receipts as payment. At some point the ""bankers"" realized that most of the gold never left their vaults, so they could create receipts for more gold than they actually had. As long as the people didn't realize what they were doing, they could get a way with it.

 However, if enough people suspected they were operating on a fractional reserve system, it would lead to a run on the bank, where people would demand to take custody of their gold, but there isn't sufficient gold for everyone to do so. Eventually, this led the current system, where the Federal Reserve, the ""lender of last resort"", can print money to bail out banks. Of course, this means that banks can take more risk, since they know the Fed has their back.

However, gold is hard to securely take custody of, store and transfer in any substantial quantity. This is what led people to store them in centralized services in the first place, and discourages them from taking custody. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is quite easy to take custody of, store, and send. And it's getting easier. This will mean that more people will take custody of it, reducing the ability of banks to artificially inflate the supply. Also, there is no Federal Reserve that can print bitcoin to bail them out if there's a bank run. So if banks do create paper bitcoin, they'll have to be much more conservative than they are with fiat."	1e535ac2c36aa764f1cb07e352cb27834e9b16c7	True	False					0	1658836677		0	{}	ihpcww8	False	t3_w8b4c5	False	True	t3_w8b4c5	/r/Bitcoin/comments/w8b4c5/will_banks_inflate_bitcoin_just_like_they_inflate/ihpcww8/	1658836691	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]		i think they will to some extent but there is no lender of last resort that can press a button and create money out of thin air to bail them out like there is in the fiat world the same kind of thing happened with gold the first bankers were actually providing a gold storage service where they would store the gold for their customers and give them a receipt for it other people could accept these receipts as payment at some point the bankers realized that most of the gold never left their vaults so they could create receipts for more gold than they actually had as long as the people didn t realize what they were doing they could get a way with it however if enough people suspected they were operating on a fractional reserve system it would lead to a run on the bank where people would demand to take custody of their gold but there isn t sufficient gold for everyone to do so eventually this led the current system where the federal reserve the lender of last resort can print money to bail out banks of course this means that banks can take more risk since they know the fed has their back however gold is hard to securely take custody of store and transfer in any substantial quantity this is what led people to store them in centralized services in the first place and discourages them from taking custody bitcoin on the other hand is quite easy to take custody of store and send and it s getting easier this will mean that more people will take custody of it reducing the ability of banks to artificially inflate the supply also there is no federal reserve that can print bitcoin to bail them out if there s a bank run so if banks do create paper bitcoin they ll have to be much more conservative than they are with fiat 	0.0027585956268012524	0.9880602955818176	0.5520763993263245	0.0468783974647522	0.008707535453140736	0.2638239860534668	0.07305264472961426	8.351647693416453e-07	0.41261717677116394	0.010236458852887154

Allowing ""pull"" payments is a huge part of the fraud problem though and you can have a ""push"" based payment system while still allowing for chargebacks.

On the chargeback side of things though, there are better ways to combat lack of service follow-through than simply allowing reverse of payments and lack of settlement finality. Chargebacks just isn't worth the fraud costs for the minor benefit it provides the consumer.

LexisNexis estimates that every $1 of fraud now costs $4 in the economy and those costs are passed to consumers in the costs of goods. An estimated 5-10% of the costs of goods is due to fraud losses and the expenses associated with fraud prevention.

I've never felt the need to use a chargeback in a dispute myself, but it is hardly worth the costs due to the inherent design failures in our payment systems themselves that result in the massive amount of fraud that takes place. The costs of fraud keep on rising year over year too. Something needs to change.

“Banks in the Real World
In today’s modern economy most money takes the form of deposits, but rather than being created by a group of savers entrusting the bank withholding their money, deposits are actually created when banks extend credit (i.e., create new loans). As Joseph Schumpeter once wrote, “It is much more realistic to say that the banks 'create credit,' that is, that they create deposits in their act of lending than to say that they lend the deposits that have been entrusted to them.”
2

When a bank makes a loan, there are two corresponding entries that are made on its balance sheet, one on the assets side and one on the liabilities side. The loan counts as an asset to the bank and it is simultaneously offset by a newly created deposit, which is a liability of the bank to the depositor holder. Contrary to the story described above, loans actually create deposits.”

Sure, so the bank lent money to a borrower and the borrower deposited the money back in the bank. The bank can then lend out a portion of the money to another borrower. Well, of course it can. The first borrower deposited the money back didn’t he? The money is being multiplied exactly as I explained and it’s not being “created” like you are arguing. So long as the bank reserves are sufficient to pay depositors (original and the borrowers who deposited the funds back) who want their money, the bank will remain solvent. If more people ask for money than the reserves held at the bank, it will go insolvent but still will not be able to create money. It could be rescued by another bank or by the regulator at that point or could go bankrupt but it cannot create money out of air

And fractional reserve banking is exactly what I am explaining. That term does not mean banks create money. It just means banks can lend out a large proportion of their deposits.

Yeah, it's the story of a man who made a mistake, but has become completely obsessed and gone (nearly) insane.

&gt;Howells took me up to the second floor, to see where the hard drive had been. The dog patrolled the stairs. “Ruby was basically the kids’ dog,” he explained. “And when we split up, and they left, she didn’t want to take the dog.” It turned out that Hafina had left several years ago with their children. I asked him if the bitcoin loss had played a role in their breakup. “The truth?” he said. “I tried publicly, and within my normal life, not to blame her, but I think subconsciously I did.”

Note that HE threw the drive into the trash and then asked her take out the trash. Blaming her in any way is already crazy. Although I think that entire story is kind of suspicious too (why throw away an empty drive, how did he forget about his bitcoins for YEARS), but it's probably what he really believes.

&gt;Looking around, you could see that time had stood still in the house since then. There was dust on everything. The Minecraft-inspired wallpaper he’d installed to please the children was peeling. The blue-and-white paint was chipping. The sheets on the bunk beds were crumpled and stale, as if the kids had left in a hurry and never come back.

&gt;He told me that his children were into other things now, and didn’t visit anymore. He did not wish to discuss any romantic relationships that he’d had since Hafina left. “I try to keep to myself,” he told me. “Women are costly.”

&gt;Howells was no longer employed. For more than a year after the loss of the hard drive, he had continued at his job as a systems engineer. To make the workday tolerable, he’d limited how often he consulted the bitcoin-tracking app. He’d even tried to avoid driving routes that took him by the dump. But, eventually, the memory of the money he had thrown away overpowered his work ethic. “I kind of lost the motivation,” he explained."	336dc8226782f197318de98e9481178b05b8f611	True	False					0	1658833958		0	{}	ihp8h68	False	t3_w742qv	False	True	t1_ihinhga	/r/Bitcoin/comments/w742qv/james_howells_lost_181m_bitcoin_in_dump_the_11m/ihp8h68/	1658833970	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]		 gt losing the hard drive was not the biggest mistake he has made yeah it s the story of a man who made a mistake but has become completely obsessed and gone nearly insane gt howells took me up to the second floor to see where the hard drive had been the dog patrolled the stairs ruby was basically the kids dog he explained and when we split up and they left she didn t want to take the dog it turned out that hafina had left several years ago with their children i asked him if the bitcoin loss had played a role in their breakup the truth he said i tried publicly and within my normal life not to blame her but i think subconsciously i did note that he threw the drive into the trash and then asked her take out the trash blaming her in any way is already crazy although i think that entire story is kind of suspicious too why throw away an empty drive how did he forget about his bitcoins for years but it s probably what he really believes gt looking around you could see that time had stood still in the house since then there was dust on everything the minecraft inspired wallpaper he d installed to please the children was peeling the blue and white paint was chipping the sheets on the bunk beds were crumpled and stale as if the kids had left in a hurry and never come back gt he told me that his children were into other things now and didn t visit anymore he did not wish to discuss any romantic relationships that he d had since hafina left i try to keep to myself he told me women are costly gt howells was no longer employed for more than a year after the loss of the hard drive he had continued at his job as a systems engineer to make the workday tolerable he d limited how often he consulted the bitcoin tracking app he d even tried to avoid driving routes that took him by the dump but eventually the memory of the money he had thrown away overpowered his work ethic i kind of lost the motivation he explained 	0.0023540311958640814	0.98857182264328	0.7754742503166199	0.01743115298449993	0.00828674528747797	0.5066696405410767	0.09029151499271393	8.334922085850849e-07	0.1556861400604248	0.01101694256067276

Your questions read like **you already know the answer and that the answer is bad.** It makes you seem inauthentic and insincere, which you are. 

The notion that people **have** to answer your posts is also hilarious - who do you think you are? sometimes posts flop. 

&gt;Rocket pool is just another 3rd party app that takes custody of your ETH to stake if from what I understand. Why can’t you stake from your wallet without handing over your ETH?

I don't know enough about RP to answer this but as far as I understand it's completely non-custodial. You are putting money into a pool and once it reaches 16 ETH a node operator will match it with his 16 ETH to run a node. The 16 ETH from the node operator will protect pool participants from slashing events - making it extremely safe for small stakers to participate. 

I understand why you ask in the framing that you do though, it's probably because you have a delegated POS bag.

I am sorry. I was an ETH supporter until self custody came under attack. Self custody is very important to crypto. I just don’t understand how you can rationalize that small people giving up custody of their ETH to community pools supports decentralization. People who want to do a home setup can’t because the vast majority of people can’t afford that much ETH.

ETH will probably lose a lot of people due to this. There are so many people that believe in “not your keys, not your crypto” including me. Centralized exchanges will control the ETH of all the crypto noobs.

Mark my words. If ETH doesn’t do its best to increase security for the little guys then people will move on. My questions are the same as what others are asking. I would argue that the majority of ETH holders don’t have 32 ETH and that the majority of this stake will end up on centralized exchanges. I could be wrong but if this happens ETH will become incredibly more centralized. Lido Coinbase and Binance already have MASSIVE amounts of community ETH.

I truly want ETH to succeed but I see the writing on the wall and ETH Maxies will ride this path to the end. I wish you luck. Keep attacking everyone who asks questions. That will really help ETH grow. I wanted a reason to stay but there isn’t even one. Not even toxic ETH maxies can defend the tech. “Giving up your ETH to others promotes decentralization” good to know buddy."	2c324c8bb15dba79fb1333b18e519ec452f3ec9d	True	False					0	1658832111		0	{}	ihp5rn3	False	t3_w7mfkm	False	True	t1_ihp2417	/r/ethereum/comments/w7mfkm/what_were_the_initial_reasons_for_a_switch_to/ihp5rn3/	1658832125	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		so you just want people to buy 32 eth to support decentralization delegated proof of stake is just as decentralized as this style of proof of stake and it promotes self custody i am sorry i was an eth supporter until self custody came under attack self custody is very important to crypto i just don t understand how you can rationalize that small people giving up custody of their eth to community pools supports decentralization people who want to do a home setup can t because the vast majority of people can t afford that much eth eth will probably lose a lot of people due to this there are so many people that believe in not your keys not your crypto including me centralized exchanges will control the eth of all the crypto noobs mark my words if eth doesn t do its best to increase security for the little guys then people will move on my questions are the same as what others are asking i would argue that the majority of eth holders don t have 32 eth and that the majority of this stake will end up on centralized exchanges i could be wrong but if this happens eth will become incredibly more centralized lido coinbase and binance already have massive amounts of community eth i truly want eth to succeed but i see the writing on the wall and eth maxies will ride this path to the end i wish you luck keep attacking everyone who asks questions that will really help eth grow i wanted a reason to stay but there isn t even one not even toxic eth maxies can defend the tech giving up your eth to others promotes decentralization good to know buddy 	0.0023278079461306334	0.9893143177032471	0.7141562104225159	0.9333081245422363	0.0073465327732264996	0.5815881490707397	0.112769715487957	8.391198775825615e-07	0.23817449808120728	0.005695231258869171

The other company was Zoom, and we all see how they took over.
