Why am I still buying bitcoin?

A bit about me, I’m 38, American, and half my net worth is in crypto and the other half is in real estate. Of my crypto, 60% is bitcoin. It will never go below that number either. 50% of additional savings go to bitcoin.

In 2009 houses plunged. And when the pain was too much, someone gave up and someone bought. And then they plunged further, and in 2010 that same buyer who bought... bought another house.

The United States government has no way to pay off his debt. We run on deficit spending. 

The DXY is 104, The stock market is very shaky, we’re facing a potential world wide recession, and Bitcoin is 29K. Five years ago as a bitcoin approached 10 K people were maniacal and got closer to 15 K people thought they were the new kings. The good investments are things that you don’t touch for five years. And the best Ones are those that you don’t touch for 10 years.

Ask yourself this direct question: do you see the United States and the world having more or less that did the demographics and technology in 10 years? In a world soaked in debt, how can interest rates actually go up? What has the trend been...Can the trends actually be reversed?

Unlike real estate, which has a slow growing percentage of potential buyers a.k.a. population growth, bitcoin has an exponential group of adopters.

When the next stimulus comes, as it has to come because of a slowing economy, I wouldn’t be surprised to see bitcoin well over 200k. And I wouldn’t be surprised for the same people who never bought houses in the last 10 years to continue to say bubble."

Anybody here who knows what's going on?"	have some bitcoin but only in my wallet s imagination cleaning up some harddrives and found an old wallet dat loading it with bitcoin core v 22 0 0 and after all has been updated i m up for a nice surprise some btc were found on the wallet so many that it would be a substantial amount i used the wallet for mining in 2014 and 2015 so my first thought was i may have forgotten some transactions coming from a mining pool well what to do with them right first being puzzled about it then sending it to my actual wallet still thinking this can t be it would be to nice to be true sending them but yes of course nothing arrives the transaction doesn t even make its way to the mempool status 0 unconfirmed not in memory pool transaction total size 7537 bytes transaction virtual size 7537 bytes output index 0 amp x200b so i think it was a nice dream to have forgotten a little fortune while it is only a glitch in bitcoin core but i d like to understand the glitch anybody here who knows what s going on 	0.002751844236627221	0.9879322648048401	0.635345995426178	0.01911323517560959	0.00893951766192913	0.5309257507324219	0.06548362225294113	8.524169174961571e-07	0.25808098912239075	0.015903884544968605

What are the chances that Donkey and team are prioritising customers wanting to get out of [\#tether](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tether?src=hashtag_click) and literally emptying the coffers....meanwhile there are amazing white knights digging in and buying billions of tethers to stop Armageddon.

Some other thoughts about USDT..

Tether has a solution to everyone asking for their money, high rates if you don’t redeem.

This subreddit should be for open discussion for all views regarding Bitcoin."	it s never a bad idea to read and analyze anti bitcoin sentiments here s why you can t be unbiased if you re just hanging around in an echo chamber even if you think bitcoin is the future even if you think those against it are uneducated and don t understand anything it s probably still a good idea to search out the best arguments against what you re investing in listening to other people s perspectives is never a bad idea especially with something still so new even if you disagree with somebody hearing the other side of the argument is always good so you can understand their reasoning i am not saying that you need to listen and do what people with opposing opinions are telling you but on this subreddit i constantly see posts deleted or people attacking others in comments for absolutely no reason this subreddit should be for open discussion for all views regarding bitcoin 	0.0007667007739655674	0.9952316880226135	0.9421752095222473	0.009538676589727402	0.004234244581311941	0.03500038757920265	0.13173532485961914	8.361313916793733e-07	0.26752424240112305	2.2674817955703475e-05

In an interview with Financial News on Friday, Mark Mobius, the founder of Mobius Capital Partners, urged crypto traders against buying the plunge. He also revealed his bitcoin price estimate and prognosis.

While conceding that some crypto traders have profited from the ""buy the dip"" technique in the past, he cautioned that it is not a strategy that will pay off while the market is still falling. The 85-year-old founder of Mobius Capital told the publication about buying the bitcoin slump in particular:

This time it will not work until bitcoin reaches $20,000, after which there may be a bounce, but the next objective will be $10,000.

Many bitcoin investors, on the other hand, are not purchasing the dip in order to profit quickly; instead, they intend to keep their BTC for the long term. Those that predict the cryptocurrency's price will reach $100,000 this year, for example, are willing to buy at any price below that level.

I think that Bitcoin is the best store of value available and that it is superior to fiat currency and as such buying the dip will be a smart move that is of you not just interested in making fast money.  

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are fast becoming an integral part of our global civilization. 
If one takes a look at the blockchain ecosystem and how innovative projects catering to diverse needs within the ecosystem are gaining more popularity such as Silks a blockchain-based metaverse that enables users to own, trade, and profit from thoroughbred racing horses, Deedy is an NFT platform  where users can trade, rent out, view, buy, sell, enter NFT lotteries, support and connect with creators, Luckyblock which  is a digital asset project that decentralizies the lottery process via blockchain technology,   , Blanksoles is  a platform for sneakerheads to launch both physical and digital collections. It  will be easy to predict that we will definitely witness in coming years the use of blockchain technology into different facets of our life which would only help increase the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As we all know Blockchain ecosystem uses cryptocurrencies to effect transactions now imagine just how important Bitcoin will be in a world where we use blockchain technology in  schools,  in the workplace storing our personal information or even a social media blockchain platform. 

For me my major concern as the price continues to dip will be how to amass as much Bitcoin  as i can before the markets become bullish.

You can check out the  news source link below for more details:  https://news.bitcoin.com/veteran-investor-mark-mobius-expects-bitcoin-to-fall-further-cautions-crypto-traders-against-buying-the-dip/"	veteran investor mark mobius expects bitcoin to fall further cautions crypto traders against buying the dip even if bitcoin goes to an unimaginable low is buying the dip a bad idea in an interview with financial news on friday mark mobius the founder of mobius capital partners urged crypto traders against buying the plunge he also revealed his bitcoin price estimate and prognosis while conceding that some crypto traders have profited from the buy the dip technique in the past he cautioned that it is not a strategy that will pay off while the market is still falling the 85 year old founder of mobius capital told the publication about buying the bitcoin slump in particular this time it will not work until bitcoin reaches 20 000 after which there may be a bounce but the next objective will be 10 000 many bitcoin investors on the other hand are not purchasing the dip in order to profit quickly instead they intend to keep their btc for the long term those that predict the cryptocurrency s price will reach 100 000 this year for example are willing to buy at any price below that level i think that bitcoin is the best store of value available and that it is superior to fiat currency and as such buying the dip will be a smart move that is of you not just interested in making fast money bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are fast becoming an integral part of our global civilization if one takes a look at the blockchain ecosystem and how innovative projects catering to diverse needs within the ecosystem are gaining more popularity such as silks a blockchain based metaverse that enables users to own trade and profit from thoroughbred racing horses deedy is an nft platform where users can trade rent out view buy sell enter nft lotteries support and connect with creators luckyblock which is a digital asset project that decentralizies the lottery process via blockchain technology blanksoles is a platform for sneakerheads to launch both physical and digital collections it will be easy to predict that we will definitely witness in coming years the use of blockchain technology into different facets of our life which would only help increase the value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as we all know blockchain ecosystem uses cryptocurrencies to effect transactions now imagine just how important bitcoin will be in a world where we use blockchain technology in schools in the workplace storing our personal information or even a social media blockchain platform for me my major concern as the price continues to dip will be how to amass as much bitcoin as i can before the markets become bullish you can check out the news source link below for more details https news bitcoin com veteran investor mark mobius expects bitcoin to fall further cautions crypto traders against buying the dip 	0.0026654480025172234	0.9876272678375244	0.39796578884124756	0.947530210018158	0.009149287827312946	0.43324530124664307	0.12530939280986786	8.455607485302608e-07	0.3548535406589508	0.005188848823308945

Let's be real here, you think government's are going to stand by and let a currency they can't control become the most dominant one?

It's what us the plebs want but the plebs don't hold positions of power around the world.

At most Bitcoin will just become a store of value. Don't get me wrong. You can buy things with it here and there. The option of purchasing items with Bitcoin will be available but it won't become the main one.

I don't care what any of you have to say. It's so unrealistic. As long as government's don't accept it as their new main digital currency then it ain't happening.

CBDC's will become the digital currency the masses will be using. A corporate backed currency might be possible which can work alongside CBDC's but only the future will tell.

Don't get me wrong. I believe Bitcoin will become one of the top 3 global store of value similar to Gold. Just not a currency which will replace most if not all existing  currencies."

let me first clarify one thing I have learned in my life: Pretty much everything that exists on earth can be seen from two sides, be it people with their appearance, age, origin and beliefs or animals with their behaviors or objects or especially statements and also the reason why the above statement is misunderstood from my point of view.

I hope nevertheless very much to hear further views, in order to think further...

I have been in the crypto world for more than 5 years and pretty much the first statements you hear are:

1. never invest money that you can't afford to lose
2. you haven't lost anything until you sell
3. buy altcoins to make the big money
4. HODL, Patience, WAGMI and so on....

I want to go to the second statement because it triggered some thoughts in me for a while that made me decide nowadays that maybe it is only ""half the truth"".

I have often wondered where that statement ""You haven't lost anything until you sell"" came from. The way I see it is projected for the future and not necessarily at the current time.

It's true that you don't lose anything until you sell but that's only because you haven't realized the loss yet - the same is true for profit and I think you can agree that it's a simple fact.

One holds on to the hope that in the near future the value will rise again and so one will be in the profit zone. And as we all know, no one knows exactly what the future will look like, even if there are factors that increase the likelihood of making any meaningful predictions.

Admittedly, this statement was probably made at the time when, for example, new investors with little basic knowledge of the market, panicked and hoped to save their money by selling at a loss for their own compromise, thus avoiding the risk of a total loss. On the other hand, of course, there was someone who, from a psychological point of view, took advantage of this to enrich themselves - one loses, the other wins.

It's always a balancing act between ""I don't give up hope and believe that it will regain value"" and ""I'm going to make a cut now and invest in other projects and try to make money elsewhere"" - the decision depends on several factors let alone what an investor has to go through psychologically as you could see recently the one particular coin that caused the entire market to plummet.

It is clear to me that I will never say to anyone that ""you haven't lost anything until you sell"" when the project is at the end and the project cannot go any further steps - reality over illusion.

Also admittedly, this is an extreme case now, but back in the days of Lehman Brothers would have been the majority said ""you haven't lost anything until you sell""? They were trying to save themselves. The only voice you heard after a while was yours.

In the end, the market doesn't really care about how long you hold on to something, but rather where the most profits and losses are made (just my opinion).

It is clear to me that I will never say to anyone that ""you haven't lost anything until you sell"" when the project is at the end and the project cannot go any further steps - reality over illusion.

Also admittedly, this is an extreme case now, but back in the days of Lehman Brothers would have been the majority said ""you haven't lost anything until you sell""? They were trying to save themselves. The only voice you heard after a while was yours.

In the end, the market doesn't really care about how long you hold on to something, but rather where the most profits and losses are made (just my opinion).

I would love to hear your opinions ❤"	you haven t lost anything until you sell a misleading statement hey guys let me first clarify one thing i have learned in my life pretty much everything that exists on earth can be seen from two sides be it people with their appearance age origin and beliefs or animals with their behaviors or objects or especially statements and also the reason why the above statement is misunderstood from my point of view i hope nevertheless very much to hear further views in order to think further i have been in the crypto world for more than 5 years and pretty much the first statements you hear are 1 never invest money that you can t afford to lose 2 you haven t lost anything until you sell 3 buy altcoins to make the big money 4 hodl patience wagmi and so on i want to go to the second statement because it triggered some thoughts in me for a while that made me decide nowadays that maybe it is only half the truth i have often wondered where that statement you haven t lost anything until you sell came from the way i see it is projected for the future and not necessarily at the current time it s true that you don t lose anything until you sell but that s only because you haven t realized the loss yet the same is true for profit and i think you can agree that it s a simple fact one holds on to the hope that in the near future the value will rise again and so one will be in the profit zone and as we all know no one knows exactly what the future will look like even if there are factors that increase the likelihood of making any meaningful predictions admittedly this statement was probably made at the time when for example new investors with little basic knowledge of the market panicked and hoped to save their money by selling at a loss for their own compromise thus avoiding the risk of a total loss on the other hand of course there was someone who from a psychological point of view took advantage of this to enrich themselves one loses the other wins it s always a balancing act between i don t give up hope and believe that it will regain value and i m going to make a cut now and invest in other projects and try to make money elsewhere the decision depends on several factors let alone what an investor has to go through psychologically as you could see recently the one particular coin that caused the entire market to plummet it is clear to me that i will never say to anyone that you haven t lost anything until you sell when the project is at the end and the project cannot go any further steps reality over illusion also admittedly this is an extreme case now but back in the days of lehman brothers would have been the majority said you haven t lost anything until you sell they were trying to save themselves the only voice you heard after a while was yours in the end the market doesn t really care about how long you hold on to something but rather where the most profits and losses are made just my opinion i would love to hear your opinions 	0.002469772705808282	0.988955020904541	0.9271675944328308	0.014713376760482788	0.007524498738348484	0.48998746275901794	0.08779305964708328	8.452511792711448e-07	0.1423039585351944	0.03160102665424347

They’re only going to be truly vindicated if btc drops below 10k into a death spiral. Their tether truther fud would do that, but still doubt we see that before regulatory clarity. Tether could be trouble, but it’s also not algo-backed compromised like UST was, what a terrible flaw. Would take more to depeg tether than a leverage scam. Other than that I’d expect the 200w avg to hold on its 13 year trend. Assuming the bear is typical even if long, they’ll likely be crying and screaming again post next halving. For now we just watch their exuberance with 30k bitcoin today. That’s the here and now, and 30k looks a lot better than when I was DCA’ing painstakingly through FUD from 17 to 2020. It gets easier the longer you’ve been in. 2015 was a long time ago. What a ride. Take profits. Cheers to you, butters.

I’m not a smart guy, most of you would run laps around me as it pertains to the functionality of crypto. But I do feel confident in my understanding of the nefarious tactics of wallstreet. I no longer work in finance but I have my series 65 amongst other certs. 

I’m making this post as sort of a flashlight on a small point I want to make. A few years ago wallstreet played coy and said “I guess we’ll take a look at their crypto nonsense and trade futures and maybe basket them into an etf.” They essentially played dumb to how transformative this technology is and while doing so slipped under the radar as they established a system fully capable of manipulating the temporary price of crypto. If you’ve ever found yourself wondering why the daily/weekly/monthly charts of almost every single major coin look similar it’s not that retail (you and me) are buying and selling at identical times it’s that our crypto futures have been bundled into ETF’s. Which are essentially a basket full of a select group of securities. By creating these etfs large institutions gained the ability to control the price of the assets in the basket. After all with a limited supply of each coin it’s not a tall order for this multibillion dollar for profit companies to manipulate with the use of machine learning algos. 

So without getting too much in the weeds, you’re not seeing a mass sell off. You’re seeing a curated price attack. And this won’t be the last one. And likewise our next bull run will be dictated by them. However the power of crypto comes from the fact that it has the ability to revolutionize our entire planet. And so to that end it will inevitably integrate more and more into society and a higher consolidation price will continue to be achieved. But to get there we must weather the greedy bastardization of price discovery.

The chain goes off network because of how it confirms transactions. It is susceptible to DDOS attacks in its current state. I admit that. However, once the chain resumes, you still have all your Sol. The bank closes every Sunday and you still have a bank account. It’s not like there was a major “double spend” issue or “algo-stable” issue or $1k gas fees to send $10. To me, being down while it’s in its beta is not the worst thing out there. I’ve used Sol regularly and it is the closest thing to having an ecosystem that has real world utility. It actually competes with traditional banks and their NFT ecosystem is catching up to Eth, in some cases, it’s had more volume than Eth. This is also a real world case, in which nfts can be used as an exclusivity perk for businesses to give their customers. At 4k TPS, it competes with any major bank. All in all, I’m willing to bet not everyone in the crypto subReddit even uses the ecosystem they invest in nor is concerned about decentralization as long as their “bags are pumping”. To me, crypto is about real world applications. Eth is extremely expensive to use and bitcoin, at 7 transactions a second, can only do about 604,000 transactions a day, or what Visa does in 87 seconds. Critics will say “lightning network” or “eth2.0” coming, but where is it? And why am I not justified in saying sol outages will be fixed in next node rollout?

So I’ve been looking at putting my money into a liquidity pool, and I have read about impermanent loss. 

Now usually the TVL in the pool is greater than the volume coming into the pool, so my share of the fee is like 0.3%. So if I put liquidity in this pool would the part of my liquidity that is actually used in the transaction (so that 0.3% share) be the only amount of money effected by impermanent loss. Or is the entire amount of money I put into the pool impacted by impermanent loss ?

For example: 

If I put in $1000 worth of sol and Usdc, but only $300 is actually being used for the transaction as that’s my share of the pool, is that $300 the only thing effected by impermanent loss, or is the entire $1000 effected ?
