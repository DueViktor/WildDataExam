If you prefer my less-educated explanation it’s down here👇

Well yeah you can do that for sure, but the point of V3 is to increase the capital efficiency by concentrating the liquidity to a certain price range. You may think by doing v2 style you will capture all of the fees in every range, but actually you’d lose a lot of efficiency (i.e. less fee captured)

Let’s say you have 10 grands put in uni v3 ETH-USDC pair as v2 style. It means your 10 grands is distributed from 0 to infinity, your capital being used is much much much less than if you choose a certain price range and constantly rebalancing, then basically a lot of your capital is being used

Yes, I said totally abstract number like ‘much much much less’ and ‘a lot of’ since I don’t know what’s the exact/approx number. But if you really think though about it, if you put your 10k in 2000-4000 when eth is 3000 usdc, then rebalance to 1500-3500 when eth is 2500 usdc, and so on.

Now, you clearly got scammed, but lets face it, you have proof of it. Since the payment was done in testnet, there's no way the person who you interacted with didn't know that.  


How did this transaction played out? Do you have a contract or any documented negotiation that clearly states you were selling something for a price in ETH?   


How was the contact with the other party? Do you know the person IRL? If not, did the person give any documentation about who they are? What are they using the Instagram account for? Is it a business?   


I don't know where you are from, but if you have these informations, you could probably gather everything and seek a lawyer (or a small claims court) and see if there's way of reclaiming either the account or the money.  


But if you did this kind of transaction without any real information from the third party, I guess this is a valuable lesson, as others mentioned it.   


On any kind of transaction you should always consider how it plays out, and if there's any place where it could go wrong. And this is not even about scammers only, because eventualities happen.   


This happened to me before: I bought a car from a trustworthy friend. I wire the money on a friday and he would go get the documents notorized on monday, transfering the car to my name. Dies during the weekend.

The goal isn't too hide just to get far enough from chain analysis that you can start swapping ETH for XMR at a bunch of non-KYC exchanges in smallish amounts over time without triggering automatic blocks. The sort of sites you see on kycnot.me. Some of them even have onion sites.

Unfortunately the dark web only tumblers are btc/xmr only so that's out. Atomic swaps are a possibility but that hurts the user on the receiving end of your ETH plus like I said liquidity isn't great yet.

Once I was in XMR I'd still use output management even though it's not strictly necessary, so avoiding recombining outputs, and also avoiding sending coins back to the exchange you got them from. Then you just live off the XMR forever. You can spend it directly a good number of places, you can easily swap it for clean BTC on any number of exchanges, or for prepaid gift cards at sites like coincards.com, or you can even send it straight to Kraken to swap for fiat depending on jurisdiction.

The key at this point is just to live under the radar and not get anyone asking about where your money came from. either that or you just do some traditional money laundering and integrate the funds into your businesses cash flow over time.

I'd have to read more about the ETH/ZEC bridge before I'd try that but you have to consider that token swaps on ETH aren't private, and neither are withdrawals across the bridge, so that's all in the clear you are in the ZEC chain and in the shielded pool. Then you still need to find somewhere to spend or swap your ZEC without leaving the shielded pool. And Idk but I still wouldn't trust sending it to a KYC exchange for fiat. Not trying to get into a debate about the merits of different coins, but Monero is battle tested whereas the only darknet market that ever implemented ZEC died to the feds shortly after. the math behind ZEC is if nothing else highly experimental and unproven. XMR is unflashy but provably effective. there's a reason ZEC isn't much used in places where freedom is at stake. I definitely don't trust it to save my life. I don't trust the company behind it I don't trust the math behind it. I am interested in the tech and the most recent upgrade to Halo or whatever looks slick as hell if it performs as promised.

https://dune.com/funnyking/L2-Gas-Consumption

We’re at an inflection point where we go from very high security, expensive computation, slow settlement transactions, to high security, cheap computation. There is going to be abundance of cheap blockspace and computation and we’re going to see a lot of innovation at the application layer and new demand to use it emerge.

Take a look at on-chain gaming on Starknet (MatchboxDAO), gasless transactions on ImmutableX (recursive L2/L3 scaling) and some of the new DeFi primitives on Arbitrum and Optimism that weren’t feasible on L1 (Lyra etc).

So we’ll see lots of usage migrate to L2, but continue to burn base layer gas via eip-1559. As L1 gets cheaper, L2 gets cheaper and more people use them.
