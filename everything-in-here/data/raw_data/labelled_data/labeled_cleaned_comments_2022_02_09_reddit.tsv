The research team looked at what rollups were gonna deliver, and they basically said ""by the time we're done rolling out all these neat eth 2.0 upgrades, everyone's gonna be on a rollup doing 100k TPS, no one's gonna care about our sharded chain that offers 4k TPS"". It would have been silly to stick with the original roadmap when it became clear that it was effectively pointless to do all this effort when the scaling is gonna happen elsewhere anyway.

So they pivotted the roadmap to a rollup-centric one. Instead of trying to do it all at the base layer, the base layer is gonna help maximize scaling through rollups. It turns out that this is much simpler to implement (e.g. instead of doing complex execution shards, all you have to do is data sharding that rollups can use)

and to further reduce complexity/risks, it's gonna be rolled out in phases. First the beacon chain, then the merge, then shards. So the original vision of ""Ethereum goes from Ethereum 1.0 to Ethereum 2.0 from one instant to the next"" is not happening anymore. The ""rebrand"" is to reflect that and try to fight outdated information.

The Ethereum devs set out to build a specific set of features (called Eth2) and through research, discovered that there was a better way to build it. Doing so required inventing new concepts which made the deliverable take longer than the community originally expected - the devs were open about all of this. 

You can argue that deciding to take more time wasn’t the best approach for quickly increasing the value of Eth and capitalizing on the “cheap, fast chain” hype, but that isn’t the goal of Ethereum and the larger community would have been let down had they taken that approach. 

Having used Eth2 as a name for the final deliverable was creating confusion in the community because it combined the ideas of PoS, sharding, etc… which weren’t all going to land at the same time. This is why people still think that PoS will lower fees.

I get there's different applications you can get from a Blockchain that has faster block times. But we still need a Blockchain that maximizes decentralization and security over time to transaction finality. For some uses it's better to drive a Porsche through Solana's fast lane. But for others it's better to drive a your semi truck filled with disaster relief funds through Ethereum's highly secure and decentralized slow lanes. Ok I don't know how well my analogies are working here. At the end of the day though what really matters for Ethereum is throughout, TPS. And that is being increased drastically without doing anything for time to finality - that's true but just not sure how much it matters at least to the overall blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum needs Solana with faster time to finality and Solana needs Ethereum with slower block times, higher security, and greater decentralization.	512bac4082a71fa8d75a452134e98c1379387561	True	False					0	1644301890		0	{}	hw1vu43	False	t3_sn32ty	False	True	t3_sn32ty	/r/solana/comments/sn32ty/vitalik_buterin_ethereum_will_likely_never_be/hw1vu43/	1644301901	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]		with a 13 second block time why does it need to be faster i get there s different applications you can get from a blockchain that has faster block times but we still need a blockchain that maximizes decentralization and security over time to transaction finality for some uses it s better to drive a porsche through solana s fast lane but for others it s better to drive a your semi truck filled with disaster relief funds through ethereum s highly secure and decentralized slow lanes ok i don t know how well my analogies are working here at the end of the day though what really matters for ethereum is throughout tps and that is being increased drastically without doing anything for time to finality that s true but just not sure how much it matters at least to the overall blockchain ecosystem ethereum needs solana with faster time to finality and solana needs ethereum with slower block times higher security and greater decentralization 	0.002523093018680811	0.9888906478881836	0.37255215644836426	0.21867747604846954	0.0076767499558627605	0.12827400863170624	0.1566096395254135	8.43944690132048e-07	0.45601800084114075	0.015766814351081848
