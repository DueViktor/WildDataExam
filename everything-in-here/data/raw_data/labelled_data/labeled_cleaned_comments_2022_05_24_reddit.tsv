* In Ethereum PoS 51% is not enough to attack the network, you need 67% to do it. Otherwise you can not finalize a block and after you stop the attack the attacker's blocks can just be discarded.
* There is a queue to onboard and offboard validators. This queue exists to avoid a sudden change in validators. If I remember correctly it would take around two years to acquire 67% of the PoS validators with the current number of validators.
* Ethereum introduces slashing. This means if anybody tries so propose an invalid block or tries to cheat in the voting process, it takes just one, I repeat, just ONE honest validator to report this and the attacker loses all there ETH.
* If an attacker has more than 34% and refuses to vote to finalize blocks (more than 66% is required for this), their stake is slowly taken away by the protocol until they have less than the required 32 ETH and will be thrown out as a validator.
* In an extreme case the core devs can decide to discard malicious blocks if all of the above would not be sufficient. This means that all the clients would release a new version that says that the attacker's blocks are not part of the chain anymore. This would only ever be used in the most extreme attacks, but it is something that is possible with PoS. With PoW you cannot do that, which means that it can not be protected from a hostile takeover, if the attacker has a nearly unlimited amount of capital (= a nation state).

We were talking about prices, not about increases in prices. What does it have to do with the topic, exactly? Prices increasing everywhere don't change anything to the ecosystem. Prices are still vastly different at different places of the world. 

&gt;If people were pushing it, they would have started doing it last summer when profitability was through the roof, so you should have seen it increase then and staid steady.

Investors make decisions based on what they have at hand. They didn't know what would happen back then, you're saying it yourself. To have the surge in mining difficulty we're seeing now, it would need to be many more GPUs entering the market than what we generally see, even more so if electricity prices are even higher now than before. To me, there's something more than just people piling up GPUs. 

But I think we're forgetting one aspect of the problem: the difficulty bomb. People know about it. They know it's different from beforehand because of it. And it will impact the mining difficulty more and more over time. Maybe there's something about that too, if at least psychological regarding miners themselves.

As described above the advantage in rewards for whales is minimal. Assuming no external factors, any edge can compound over time and trend to infinity. This is true for any form of capital, depending on how it is used, the more one has the more potential to grow it proportionally to the amount owned. This is true of pow and pos, and capitalism in general. In your extreme example, yes the 32 validator actors rewards trend to infinity/100%. Issue is that the example is extreme, as it assumes no reward for having under 32 eth, when in reality that could be earning rewards at roughly 85% the rate of a validator (depending on the service +-10%), and with an extreme apy that is many orders of magnitude higher than existing rates, with an assumption apy stays the same and issuance increases proportionally, it would take hundreds of years to have any meaningful divergence in the current apy, assuming there are no external actors/stakers coming in. 

In your example for 1000 blocks, the 32 eth validator rewards diverges

But for 365 blocks (1 year if each block is a day) in this extreme case the percent of validators goes from 32% to 41.4% (i wrote a script). These 365 blocks equate to roughly 228 years of eth staking rewards, assuming a constant 5% and each block equates to a day. This divergence of network control is far less effective if the unvalidated eth rewards earn a 85% effective yield if they were staked using a decentralized staking service, which in reality is something people would do, not all but it would decrease the effect at least. Even without unstaked eth earning rewards, the percent change isn't dramatic even after 228 years.

The numbers you were previously suggestioning are not nearly as alarming as you were claiming. I did the math, but are more than happy to show my work.

You make a point of a supply side attack, which makes sense for exchanges that offer staking services if they dont actually stake, and instead use the accumulated supply to sell/manipulate the market, but this concern is always present in an ecosystem with whales and is not a concern unique to pos systems. In the case of stakers generating rewards and increasing their proportional supply, the issue is that they have to stake to maintain their increasing rate of returns which means it will take longer to pull the funds out to make an attack, as only a set rate of validators can be unstaked to be used in this attack."	3e80f748e28fc48971c5ca5a2aeb2193aad0b393	True	False					0	1653321347		0	{}	i9p2nu7	False	t3_uvqmxw	False	True	t1_i9oukc3	/r/ethereum/comments/uvqmxw/did_the_luna_crash_reveal_an_inherent_risk_in/i9p2nu7/	1653321361	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]			i run a node validator nodes dont earn rewards and dont have to wait in queue staking nodes have to wait but recieve rewards and is the main focus of your supply side attack issue right as described above the advantage in rewards for whales is minimal assuming no external factors any edge can compound over time and trend to infinity this is true for any form of capital depending on how it is used the more one has the more potential to grow it proportionally to the amount owned this is true of pow and pos and capitalism in general in your extreme example yes the 32 validator actors rewards trend to infinity 100 issue is that the example is extreme as it assumes no reward for having under 32 eth when in reality that could be earning rewards at roughly 85 the rate of a validator depending on the service 10 and with an extreme apy that is many orders of magnitude higher than existing rates with an assumption apy stays the same and issuance increases proportionally it would take hundreds of years to have any meaningful divergence in the current apy assuming there are no external actors stakers coming in in your example for 1000 blocks the 32 eth validator rewards diverges but for 365 blocks 1 year if each block is a day in this extreme case the percent of validators goes from 32 to 41 4 i wrote a script these 365 blocks equate to roughly 228 years of eth staking rewards assuming a constant 5 and each block equates to a day this divergence of network control is far less effective if the unvalidated eth rewards earn a 85 effective yield if they were staked using a decentralized staking service which in reality is something people would do not all but it would decrease the effect at least even without unstaked eth earning rewards the percent change isn t dramatic even after 228 years the numbers you were previously suggestioning are not nearly as alarming as you were claiming i did the math but are more than happy to show my work you make a point of a supply side attack which makes sense for exchanges that offer staking services if they dont actually stake and instead use the accumulated supply to sell manipulate the market but this concern is always present in an ecosystem with whales and is not a concern unique to pos systems in the case of stakers generating rewards and increasing their proportional supply the issue is that they have to stake to maintain their increasing rate of returns which means it will take longer to pull the funds out to make an attack as only a set rate of validators can be unstaked to be used in this attack 	0.002810857491567731	0.9877260327339172	0.6691233515739441	0.06427200138568878	0.008372175507247448	0.32805782556533813	0.06998084485530853	8.579881409787049e-07	0.2883278727531433	0.05134499818086624
