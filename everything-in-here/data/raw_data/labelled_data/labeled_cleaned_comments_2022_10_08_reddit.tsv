10	[]	False		Dont_Say_No_to_Panda			[]				text	t2_mp8dh	False	False	"&gt;	Every withdrawal and deposit at a bank which are most cash transactions. 

Most cash transactions? I think that is a stretch. Putting aside the accuracy of that claim (I would wager more deposit transactions are checks rather than cash) for each one of those withdrawals and deposits, there are countless other cash transactions before and after that involve no recording of serial numbers. Moreover, there are still many businesses (and even entire industries) that are largely or entirely cash. Some, such as marijuana dispensaries, don’t even engage in normal business banking. For some of these businesses this is a decision to reduce their taxable profits, and for others (weed) it is because federally insured banks will not touch their business while marijuana is still federally illegal.

Despite all of this, cash is still taxed and regulated. Is it 100% accurate? Of course not, and it will be the same for Bitcoin. 

Furthermore, you write as if you have no knowledge of blockchain analysis and all of the investigative tools at the disposal of governments in 2022, namely entities like Chainalysis &amp; TRM labs. The government has traced many Bitcoin (and shitcoin) transactions to wallets and exchanges and other places that have KYC’d and have made associations that way. They have also been successful in actually seizing coins from criminals. Not because they hacked Bitcoin, but due to good investigative work and getting their hands on the criminals’ seeds (whether they gave them up willingly or not in some cases.)

Regulation will come to Bitcoin and shitcoins (and that is a good thing.)"	487a57d4e387307b6977300c71bdd01c8e0b4933	True	False					0	1665114763		0	{}	ird8pvy	False	t3_xwq2il	False	True	t1_ircio4r	/r/Bitcoin/comments/xwq2il/fighting_fire_with_fire_california_is_giving_out/ird8pvy/	1665114779	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]			 gt every withdrawal and deposit at a bank which are most cash transactions most cash transactions i think that is a stretch putting aside the accuracy of that claim i would wager more deposit transactions are checks rather than cash for each one of those withdrawals and deposits there are countless other cash transactions before and after that involve no recording of serial numbers moreover there are still many businesses and even entire industries that are largely or entirely cash some such as marijuana dispensaries don t even engage in normal business banking for some of these businesses this is a decision to reduce their taxable profits and for others weed it is because federally insured banks will not touch their business while marijuana is still federally illegal despite all of this cash is still taxed and regulated is it 100 accurate of course not and it will be the same for bitcoin furthermore you write as if you have no knowledge of blockchain analysis and all of the investigative tools at the disposal of governments in 2022 namely entities like chainalysis amp trm labs the government has traced many bitcoin and shitcoin transactions to wallets and exchanges and other places that have kyc d and have made associations that way they have also been successful in actually seizing coins from criminals not because they hacked bitcoin but due to good investigative work and getting their hands on the criminals seeds whether they gave them up willingly or not in some cases regulation will come to bitcoin and shitcoins and that is a good thing 	0.002462689531967044	0.9894146919250488	0.8793344497680664	0.9656552076339722	0.007003775332123041	0.4428524076938629	0.07534918934106827	8.418426773459942e-07	0.3028973340988159	0.011371096596121788

Primarily what we're going to see is BTC become a reserve asset like gold used to be, and then you'll have secondary and tertiary chains that will use proof of stake. That way people who don't require BTC's level of security won't incur the risk, cost, and inconvenience associated with self custody. Only the ""banks"" will need to transact on chain. Everyday purchases can all happen off chain and be settled in one TX at the end of business, spreading the cost of the on chain TX out over millions of off chain TXs that now cost fractions of a penny each to make, and use tiny little bits of electricity.

So we're talking about a thousandth to a millionth of a kwh per TX, and that energy will be derived from normally lost gas and electric from drilling and solar farms. So for example, in the middle of the day, when the solar farm is generating most of its electricity, instead of having to store that energy in a high loss expensive system, they can just run the miners.

101	[]	False		MoneyPowerNexis			[]				text	t2_635g2	False	True	"I'm not sure about billions but for anything up to tens of millions you would just use a bitcoin exchange that has no fiat withdrawal size limit. I have sold $20 million worth of bitcoin over a couple of weeks (dividing up into 5 trades and waiting for the funds to hit my bank account before putting more funds on the exchange) $4m trades did not even move the price but you would want to be using limit orders and placing the offer between the bid and ask for the best chance of getting filled in a timely manner. 

I could see selling hundreds of millions that way, it would just take longer as you would dry up the liquidity on the other side of the order book or you would have to start offering lower prices to bring in liquidity from other exchanges. 

Billions is tricky though since offering lower prices would not get you out of the trade quickly enough and people would start to see your price as the price and not discounted. Moving the price lower to get filled faster then would form a pattern of lowering prices. Even trying your best to not move prices you would at least for a time be at risk of crashing prices. At that point I would consider an OTC trade with someone like Saylor but people with deep pockets are on exchanges too so you might just need to let them know where what exchange they can buy your bitcoin on since they probably don't want to deal with the security issues of a private sale  and don't want to be moving the market against themselves either. 

There are more creative things like selling to institutional investors through the creation of funds and listed entities but they seem like less of a way to sell the bitcoin and more of a way to generate ongoing income from it.

Why to they hate it now?  

In no particular order:  
* their television told them to hate it  
* their television did not tell them to love it  
* their social media ""friends"" make fun of it; they're afraid of being laughed at by stupid fools who are broke and will always be poor -- for some reason they feel a powerful urge to fit in with people like that  
* they have no understanding of the nature of money  nor the history of money  
* they have no idea about sound money  
* they've never had nice, long conversations with people from countries with very unsound money  
* they're afraid of it because it's new and they don't understand it  
* they're too fucking lazy to bother to find out the facts  
* they don't have any cash to buy Bitcoin  
* they can't put it on their credit card  
* they can't take out a 30 year, government backed loan to buy Bitcoin  
* so far, fiat currency seems to work for them  
* when fiat currency works against them, they believe the lies telling them that somehow their financial problems are their own fault  
* they think that cutting a pizza in half doubles their amount of pizza  
* they failed math in high school  
* they never read nonfiction books  
* they believe that everything will always be exactly as it is now
* they hate rich computer geeks, they're so jealous  
* their dad used to yell at them, ""WHY CAN'T YOU BE LIKE YOUR SMART COMPUTER GEEK FRIEND??""  
* they said it was going to zero eight years ago and its wild success makes them feel insecure  
* when investing in Bitcoin there is no instant gratification  
* they think that the government will eventually ""print"" enough fiat currency to make everybody rich  
* they're lazy  
* they're afraid  
* they feel confused all the time  
* they don't know who to turn to  
* they're too busy trying to just survive the next month - they have no time, energy, or money left to spend on learning about and buying Bitcoin"	a56a8fcbd3d9cdabf32763a17b8e398d94914b6d	True	False					0	1665106801		0	{}	irct9r0	False	t3_xxl3ex	False	True	t3_xxl3ex	/r/Bitcoin/comments/xxl3ex/btc/irct9r0/	1665106816	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]			because they hate it now the smart flexible thinkers get a chance to buy at insanely low prices why to they hate it now in no particular order their television told them to hate it their television did not tell them to love it their social media friends make fun of it they re afraid of being laughed at by stupid fools who are broke and will always be poor for some reason they feel a powerful urge to fit in with people like that they have no understanding of the nature of money nor the history of money they have no idea about sound money they ve never had nice long conversations with people from countries with very unsound money they re afraid of it because it s new and they don t understand it they re too fucking lazy to bother to find out the facts they don t have any cash to buy bitcoin they can t put it on their credit card they can t take out a 30 year government backed loan to buy bitcoin so far fiat currency seems to work for them when fiat currency works against them they believe the lies telling them that somehow their financial problems are their own fault they think that cutting a pizza in half doubles their amount of pizza they failed math in high school they never read nonfiction books they believe that everything will always be exactly as it is now they hate rich computer geeks they re so jealous their dad used to yell at them why can t you be like your smart computer geek friend they said it was going to zero eight years ago and its wild success makes them feel insecure when investing in bitcoin there is no instant gratification they think that the government will eventually print enough fiat currency to make everybody rich they re lazy they re afraid they feel confused all the time they don t know who to turn to they re too busy trying to just survive the next month they have no time energy or money left to spend on learning about and buying bitcoin	0.0007563214749097824	0.9955970644950867	0.9023848176002502	0.01434133667498827	0.0038450779393315315	0.999169111251831	0.07743634283542633	8.376821938327339e-07	0.1507990062236786	5.526417589862831e-05

**Yes credit in the way it is commonly used now is very bad,** creating a generation  of people paying off debt for depreciating items and preventing their own financial success.

**Everything would be cheaper without credit cards.**

First the goalpost keeps moving which solana native chain has never been hacked. Binance has been. That’s the original comment. 

Second nobody decides to halt. It’s I’m the inverse. Because of technical reasons, mostly due to super high demand (usually hot NFT launches), the network was unable to reach consensus because it was prepared to deal with so much activity.

Just a few ideas, which are not just copies of things you could do on other networks (like run a node, deploy a smart contract, etc, although you can do all of those things as well!.):

1. Get involved in [governance](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/democracy)
2. Read, post, and interact with others on [Subsocial](https://app.subsocial.network/)
3. See what the prediction markets are saying about future events with [Zeitgeist](https://app.zeitgeist.pm/)
4. Check out the [Kusamaverse](https://odyssey.org/) (explore Kusama in the Metaverse)
5. Control a telescope, take pictures of astronomical phenomena and NFT-ize them with [Robobomics](https://robonomics.network/blog/online-winter-school-2022-lesson-telescope/)

That's just a few things off the top of my head. You can check out the different parachains on [Polkadot](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/parachains) and [Kusama](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/parachains) and try different things out on lots of different chains, all the while using your same keypair.     


\&gt; What are some innovative ways to use DOT in a financial way that I could test out with a small amount?
