I like the way you worded this part. Right now it is kind of an opportunity, but nobody is going to be able to get utility companies on board with Bitcoin mining anytime in the near future (\~5 years). By that time, we will have better technology to solve the problem of ""excess energy"".

Energy storage is promoted as the solution to the variable availability of renewable energy. At the same time, there are more and more advocates claiming that renewable energy is now cheaper than fossil fuel fired electricity generation  

But the ""cheaper"" claim does not factor in the cost of storage. The entire discussion assumes that capital investment is free, ""My solar array provides free energy all year"", ignoring the $40k cost of the panels and $20k cost of a wall battery which drains in a few hours  

Capital investment for large-scale hydro gravity storage is about $3 billion per gigawatt, for storing about 100 hours. That's a valuable project, will serve its energy market for centuries. But someone has to stump up the billions to build it, and then wait 6 years before it's running  

One of the Texas sites has announced a battery storage facility. These are much faster to build, but grid-connected ""large-scale"" battery facilities are tiny, rarely more than 100MW for a few hours. This is equivalent to a UPS at home, provides power for long enough to perform a safe shutdown

&gt; demand response systems

We have those here. Each street-level substation has a natural gas generator to respond to local demand peaks. The neighbors are never informed that the century-old substation next door has recently started emitting gas combustion fumes

---

Bitcoin mining deals in Texas supposedly fit into the same slot as that sector of the retail market which passes high demand prices onto ""smart meter"" customers to give them the choice of shutting down their appliances when the price is temporarily $10 (or recently, $200) per kW-hour, with the benefit of a 50% rate discount during low-demand periods  

The benefit to the supplier is that they can contract demand-based pricing to large customers (Bitcoin miners) more easily than retail customers, and they can contract for the miners to agree to complete shutdown at 30 minutes notice during high demand  

The flaws?  

Discount rates only make economic sense where there's a high excess of supply over demand, as when a new generator is commissioned. It's cheaper to run the generator at minimum output and sell the supply to miners for 2 cents than it is to decommission the generator until there is sufficient demand. This was the basis of Bitcoin mining in some areas of China for about 5 years. When the market demand for power exceeds the minimum running capacity of the generator, selling to miners for 2 cents is financially negative  

You'll see claims that selling power to Bitcoin miners creates a revenue guarantee which can be used to justify funding new generation capacity. This is financially similar to the China situation, but shifts the timing. The miners are burning current supply, not underutilized newly built generators. Bitcoin mining isn't a stable future revenue source for the generation businesses, so it makes no sense to claim it will motivate new investment  

From the mining point of view, the greatest flaw is that Bitcoin mining is financially marginal, and repaying the hardware capital cost requires 24/7 operation. The shareholders in all these ventures have bought into a loss-making business  

Eventually, the Texas undersupply problem creates longer and longer downtime for the Bitcoin miners. How well do the dispute resolution procedures work?

Another important reason is that the Fed raises interest rates in response to inflation, so the return that the money managers will get on their cash increases.

To be clear, no one is actually holding actual cash because it doesn't bear interest (and it's bulky, hard to store, theft risk, etc.). When money managers refer to ""cash"", they usually mean immediate term USD assets (like savings accounts and money market funds) and short term USD assets (corporate paper, short term Treasuries, etc.). These more general forms of ""cash"" bear interest at roughly the rate that the Fed sets.

A lot of the rhetoric around here about USD inflation is seriously misleading as it assumes there lots of non-interest-bearing USD out there that are guaranteed to lose purchasing power. There really aren't: the vast majority of USD used as savings/investment do bear interest. The higher the Fed raises interest rates, the more interest these USD return. This is one of the ways the Fed controls inflation: in effect, interest rates control how attractive of an ""investment"" / ""store of value"" interest-bearing USD are."	3831d1210e3f238945d382b55697f9f216dde5d5	True	False					0	1658072219		0	{}	igj0m8a	False	t3_vy35pj	False	True	t1_ifzv92a	/r/Bitcoin/comments/vy35pj/can_someone_explain_how_after_record_inflation_is/igj0m8a/	1658072231	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]		 gt when inflation risk is high money managers want cash another important reason is that the fed raises interest rates in response to inflation so the return that the money managers will get on their cash increases to be clear no one is actually holding actual cash because it doesn t bear interest and it s bulky hard to store theft risk etc when money managers refer to cash they usually mean immediate term usd assets like savings accounts and money market funds and short term usd assets corporate paper short term treasuries etc these more general forms of cash bear interest at roughly the rate that the fed sets a lot of the rhetoric around here about usd inflation is seriously misleading as it assumes there lots of non interest bearing usd out there that are guaranteed to lose purchasing power there really aren t the vast majority of usd used as savings investment do bear interest the higher the fed raises interest rates the more interest these usd return this is one of the ways the fed controls inflation in effect interest rates control how attractive of an investment store of value interest bearing usd are 	0.002896917052567005	0.9877459406852722	0.21177470684051514	0.9535033702850342	0.008940396830439568	0.2688629925251007	0.12058016657829285	8.425550959145767e-07	0.4730639159679413	0.02538888528943062

Same can be done w refrigerated warehouses but not as quickly. Essentially the mirror of solar/wind which provide highly inconsistent generation. There are examples being developed of miners taking methane from landfills, flare gas, and whatever other locations you can drop a miner (and genset when reqd) in-line between energy supply and grid. There are some good podcasts on the ideas. Batteries are problematic IMO for stabilizing the grid outside of dense urban areas, but many smart folks are working on alternative materials all the time so time will tell.	13a84e298b1a4c7242a358551b65445fad79efca	True	False					0	1658071823		0	{}	igizqh2	False	t3_w19i32	False	True	t3_w19i32	/r/Bitcoin/comments/w19i32/bitcoin_mining_and_stabilizing_the_power_grid_is/igizqh2/	1658071835	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]		as i understand it i work in renewables the miners act as reactive loads so effectively a constant demand when energy is plentiful as you say soaking up excess supply but when the grid needs more heat wave eg they can accept your utility s scada signal to reduce their consumption same can be done w refrigerated warehouses but not as quickly essentially the mirror of solar wind which provide highly inconsistent generation there are examples being developed of miners taking methane from landfills flare gas and whatever other locations you can drop a miner and genset when reqd in line between energy supply and grid there are some good podcasts on the ideas batteries are problematic imo for stabilizing the grid outside of dense urban areas but many smart folks are working on alternative materials all the time so time will tell 	0.0029861191287636757	0.9883862137794495	0.034841444343328476	0.015653880313038826	0.008780877105891705	0.47586774826049805	0.0884152501821518	8.291104904856184e-07	0.40167853236198425	0.026889082044363022

You are correct that other businesses accept Bitcoin as well , and not just this list but many people at the multiple farmers and trade markets too.

https://maps.bitcoinjungle.app/

FYI- from the businesses I spoke to here are some facts :

1) They say that ~2-4% of their sales are in Bitcoin , which would make sense since that is similar to the global adoption. I will purposely only try to spend in bitcoin businesses and tell the shop owners that it benefits them because it encourages loyal repeat clients spending and replacing their BTC at their establishment

2) This is an attempt to replicate EL Salvador's Bitcoin beach and to encourage more adoption as bitcoin as p2p money. The creators use a multisig with the bitcoin jungle app for better security and providing support and liquidity somewhat like what HAL suggested to bootstrap businesses but can withdraw at any time. I also educate businesses about self sovereignty instead of this custodial wallet that uses btcpay as the backend for merchant processing .

3) The businesses I speak to keep their BTC , and do not sell it for fiat which is very wise especially since we are in a bear market . 

4) Merchant processing fees for visa/mastercard are much higher in this country than the USA (~%5.5 + additional fees minimum, thus it comes to ~7-8% in fees and if they Use BAC for discover and amex its higher) thus accepting lightning not only removes the risk of fraud and charge backs but many fees for local merchants. this is why local merchants often give discounts for paying ""en efectivo""

5) I know of a few homes in Costa rica that have been sold for bitcoin as well. Costa Rica is very affluent and safe these days and most of the nicer property has been sold. 

Let me know if you have any other questions.

So centralized crypto's like SOL emerged, hoping to be more customer friendly but end up missing the point with centralized control and infrastructure that cannot keep up with demand. So they crash instead of going into a gas fee war. 

As a reference, FIAT's supporting infrastructure: armored cars, printing facilities, warehouses, servers are either paid with through taxes, merchant fees (credit cards) etc vs one transaction at a time. 

Crypto needs to offer something better if it's going to be currency. People trust the US dollar 💵 despite what doom porn people say. So for now, it's best used in gaming so that players can own their assets. 

I would like to see the people running Solana take stands on political (Ukraine) and environmental issues (climate change) so they are not seen as a bunch of apathetic pricks.

However, if you stake directly with a validator, there's risk of slashing, where the validator may go offline, get hacked, or act maliciously, resulting in the SOL staked to the validator getting slashed. That's why a lot of people are recommending moving to stake pools, where your SOL gets staked across many validators to improve decentralization and decrease slashing risk. You'll also be able to withdraw easily through liquid staking, meaning that you won't need to wait 2-3 days for the delays in unstaking.

I run a stake pool called BlazeStake ([stake.solblaze.org](https://stake.solblaze.org)), it's the lowest in TVL so we're most in need of new stake.

Choosing a pool allows your risk to be spread out across several validators. The pool manager will take care of removing validators that are about to get slashed, and if you stake with a larger validator set pool such as BlazeStake with 64 validators, if one validator gets slashed and the pool manager forgets to remove them, you only lose 1/64 of what you would have lost if you staked directly.

I wouldn't say that there's ""literally no risk"" with native staking because slashing is indeed coming to Solana (I talked to Anatoly a few months ago and he confirmed that it's definitely going to happen and there's no way around it), but there is a slightly higher risk when choosing a pool. However, I wouldn't say it's that much more risk, especially if you're staking with either BlazeStake or JPool, as both of these pools use the deployment of the smart contract that is directly managed by Solana Labs/Foundation itself (meaning we don't have access to maliciously update the program) and has been heavily audited by Labs/Foundation as well as several auditing firms."	1881cb5ba69244533c75669c1239294b2ae37b12	True	False					0	1658087393		0	{}	igjzkor	False	t3_w16k16	False	True	t1_igjftz1	/r/solana/comments/w16k16/why_is_the_majority_of_sol_not_liquid_staked/igjzkor/	1658087409	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]		just so you know native staking is technically a smart contract stake11111111111111111111111111111111111111 and there s risk with native staking as well since when the developers activate slashing you could lose your sol with your validator if you aren t being cautious and doing a lot of research choosing a pool allows your risk to be spread out across several validators the pool manager will take care of removing validators that are about to get slashed and if you stake with a larger validator set pool such as blazestake with 64 validators if one validator gets slashed and the pool manager forgets to remove them you only lose 1 64 of what you would have lost if you staked directly i wouldn t say that there s literally no risk with native staking because slashing is indeed coming to solana i talked to anatoly a few months ago and he confirmed that it s definitely going to happen and there s no way around it but there is a slightly higher risk when choosing a pool however i wouldn t say it s that much more risk especially if you re staking with either blazestake or jpool as both of these pools use the deployment of the smart contract that is directly managed by solana labs foundation itself meaning we don t have access to maliciously update the program and has been heavily audited by labs foundation as well as several auditing firms 	0.003082510782405734	0.98792564868927	0.16503454744815826	0.04828251525759697	0.009630140848457813	0.20580588281154633	0.11729510128498077	8.489892024954315e-07	0.5269454717636108	0.0019951036665588617

I run one at BlazeStake ([stake.solblaze.org](https://stake.solblaze.org)) which is the smallest pool, so just as you may stake with a validator that doesn't have a lot of stake in order to increase decentralization, please consider similarly staking with a stake pool that doesn't have a lot of stake!"	a90be35f047fac9b9f7b15dda507b29a5ce0a723	True	False					0	1658086655		0	{}	igjxudm	False	t3_w16k16	False	True	t3_w16k16	/r/solana/comments/w16k16/why_is_the_majority_of_sol_not_liquid_staked/igjxudm/	1658086667	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]		that s definitely an interesting question when you look at something like steth there s been much more adoption compared to solana stake pools as soon as slashing is implemented people who aren t staking with a pool will start to lose money if they get unlucky with their validator selection so i don t understand why people don t choose a pool and get that protection from slashing in any case i think some people raised the concern about one pool getting too much control over stake that s why it s a good idea to stake with smallest pools i run one at blazestake stake solblaze org https stake solblaze org which is the smallest pool so just as you may stake with a validator that doesn t have a lot of stake in order to increase decentralization please consider similarly staking with a stake pool that doesn t have a lot of stake 	0.0022429160308092833	0.9890571236610413	0.3273264467716217	0.04336671158671379	0.99506676197052	0.3747468590736389	0.10759072750806808	8.26998075353913e-07	0.46065592765808105	0.0023310116957873106
