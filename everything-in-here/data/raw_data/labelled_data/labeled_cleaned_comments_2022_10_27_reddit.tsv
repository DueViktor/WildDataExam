Then we have $217T of real estate, of which 40-60% is attributable to monetary premium based on comparisons of the non-mortgage values since leaving the gold standard. we’re already above $450T but there’s still another $80T of public equities, where the debt-based premium needs to be removed. Let’s say 25% of that given current debt to equity ratios for another $20T. I haven’t yet counted the demonetization of gold and other precious metals adding to ~$10T…. We’ve got an upper bound of $500T and around 20m coins. So the total addressable market is indeed $25m.	70a2b39b3bda9589412b8bf485fb8fc31611a36a	True	False					0	1666755149		0	{}	ittabea	False	t3_ydl7r3	False	True	t1_itt8zwy	/r/Bitcoin/comments/ydl7r3/im_sure_this_has_been_asked_many_times_already/ittabea/	1666755161	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]			akshually there is 250t of fiat debt an additional 100t of broad fiat money so all of that 350t is worthless and can flow to bitcoin then we have 217t of real estate of which 40 60 is attributable to monetary premium based on comparisons of the non mortgage values since leaving the gold standard we re already above 450t but there s still another 80t of public equities where the debt based premium needs to be removed let s say 25 of that given current debt to equity ratios for another 20t i haven t yet counted the demonetization of gold and other precious metals adding to 10t we ve got an upper bound of 500t and around 20m coins so the total addressable market is indeed 25m 	0.0007878963951952755	0.9953091740608215	0.4132912755012512	0.12606999278068542	0.004240457434207201	0.062470920383930206	0.14972944557666779	8.407234872720437e-07	0.4457513391971588	0.0030475915409624577

Turned my back on it. Bought stocks and lost it all  close to 100k of my hard work in 3 years gambling on a few small caps.

Ignored the whole 2017 run because of this (not wanting to sell my losses

Lost job in 2020, and used inheritance to buy stocks and made money finally. Only to invest in bitcoin and move it to Celsius to earn yield. Lost that. Absolutely devastated.

Yet I somehow picked myself up. Only I am to blame for decisions. Not putting bitcoin on ledger and staying consistent all these years.

I’ve lost millions in opportunity cost in not following logic and my beliefs. The great thing is that there is always hope and tomorrow. I only buy bitcoin and put on ledger. Even at this rate of 0.3 BTC if you can keep that safe and store it you’ll always be a top 1% holder.

Because this is BTC:

Bitcoin is open source. It’s decentralized. It’s free market. It trades globally 24/7. It’s permissionless. Its distribution is fixed and predictable. It’s pseudonymous. Verifiable. It’s impairment resistant. It’s a store of value, a currency, and a central bank, in one singularity. It’s full-stack is sophisticated, impossibly simple, beautiful, and looks like something you’d expect of 20-years worth of work from the cypherpunks that gave us encryption.  
  
One of the major tenants the well read maxi's preach is that as money is separated from State, the political class gets demonetized globally. This means their ability to make war is over. The military industrial complexes collapse, and all the energy, money, and resources spent there can get redistributed. This is bitcoin's vision of wealth redistribution. The hope is borders fall a bit, and tax levies are impaired enough that only projects of value with transparent accounting get the cut. The hope is because BTC has a habit of appreciating in value, consumer's time preferences get longer, and gone is the mindless nonsense consumerism, and this combined with deflationary pressure of the asset, not only keeps consumer prices equitable, buy allows someone working even a menial job the ability to store their work energy in an asset that won't depreciate.  
  
  
So as the internet, blockchains, remote work, and the proliferation of English compose, the centers of power start getting distributed away. It's no longer a world that can even house dictators, or finance surveillance states or afford large scale corruption anymore. Lots of power gets returned to the people and maybe here we unlock our collective value.  
I'm of the belief as well, that bitcoin lengthens people's time preferences, and does away with their mindless consumerism. Saving money, and having that money maintain its value from 1-5 years or even appreciate, will completely change people's minds and discipline. It's the mindless consumerism which has destroyed the environment and leads to climate change. Nobody will admit that though? It's the mad inflating dollars promoting this. Gov't has to give away dollars in Student Loan Forgiveness, how else can our young adults have a good time? They are lost in the black stuck hole of fiscal irresponsibility. Growth, growth, growth, how else can you outpace inflation? Spend that shit the moment you get it or start losing the moment you don't.   
  
This is a crucially overlooked aspect of bitcoin. And since we run on 4-year election cycles, where the hell are you going to find the political capital to do the right thing and say party is over, we can't promote this growth and have a planet too. I can't keep spending trillions for my legacy and hand the bag off for the next President to do the same thing.  
Lastly, I'll add bitcoin mining is what will promote green energy to reduce its own liability, and capture energy waste. But mainstream talking points move in 24 hour cycles and innovation takes longer than that type of patience.  
  
If there are 21 million BTC total, that means there are 2.1 quadrillion SATS  
A hard wallet allows you (and only you) to know and have control over your private keys. This is known as a non-custodial option. Coinbase or Kraken would be known as a custodial option, because they are in custody of your keys and your coins.  
If a hard wallet is stolen, burned, lost, or the company goes out of business, it doesn't matter. There's no bitcoin inside your wallet. Your bitcoin exists on the blockchain in pieces called UTXO's (unspent transaction outputs) which are the individual amounts your wallet address received from other wallet addresses. Your private keys, are what give you the authority to do with these as you please.  
Your private keys (also called a seed phrase or BIP-39 phrase) is basically your master password. It's 12 or 24 words long and your wallet generates them the first time you set one up. Nobody can every be shown this, because they will have control of your bitcoin.  
Your hard wallet or any wallet for that matter holds only your private keys. They're encrypted so that whenever you want to make a transaction or use it, you don't have to type in 12 or 24 words each time, which would also require you to carry your private keys around, which is a security hazard. So instead you just have a pin number on the hard wallet. Fast and convenient.  
Now if you lose the wallet like we talked about above, it doesn't matter as long as you have your private keys. You can insert those into any BIP-39 compliant wallet (which is 99.9% of all of them) and recover your bitcoin.

I hope this helps! I could go on and on with more data if you wish.

Good Luck and Cheers to your future."	743a8d795c5846a573279584920afb8ff0ece3ea	True	False					0	1666750296		0	{}	itt0tie	False	t3_ydlta7	False	True	t3_ydlta7	/r/Bitcoin/comments/ydlta7/tired_of_being_broke/itt0tie/	1666750314	1	True	True	False	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	r/Bitcoin	public		0	[]

address received from other wallet addresses your private keys are what give you the authority to do with these as you please your private keys also called a seed phrase or bip 39 phrase is basically your master password it s 12 or 24 words long and your wallet generates them the first time you set one up nobody can every be shown this because they will have control of your bitcoin your hard wallet or any wallet for that matter holds only your private keys they re encrypted so that whenever you want to make a transaction or use it you don t have to type in 12 or 24 words each time which would also require you to carry your private keys around which is a security hazard so instead you just have a pin number on the hard wallet fast and convenient now if you lose the wallet like we talked about above it doesn t matter as long as you have your private keys you can insert those into any bip 39 compliant wallet which is 99 9 of all of them and recover your bitcoin i hope this helps i could go on and on with more data if you wish good luck and cheers to your future

I feel we're both singing from the same hymn sheet here to be honest. 

Regulations should target the centralized services, and should maybe restrict what they offer to the public to provide a safer environment for those who don't know what they're doing. 

Access to DeFi services through KYC means should be regulated.   
But the operations of DeFi networks should NEVER be infringed upon.   
This is (Or, at least it's meant to be) decentralized infrastructure.   
You do not have the right to regulate what isn't yours.   
It is perfectly fine to stop authorized bodies from offering access to certain products and services.   
What is not fine, is trying to stop me from accessing them myself and doing as I please. But this is EXACTLY where we are going.

For the situation of most consensus actors, it's PoS which has the best advantages because:

* it's much more sustainable long term to ensure the issuance stays relevant and worth it, since PoW requires a huge maintenance cost the network has to continuously pay for;

* it's a lot less vulnerable to consensus attacks, which ensures the chain is way more secure long term as a consensus actor; 

* it ensures you don't need either lots of funds invested in mining equipment or a pool to receive rewards frequently enough to be profitable; instead, you only need up to 32 ETH, a lot less than what's required to reasonably mine by yourself without lots of operational costs;

* it ensures you can start being part of the process with as low as ~0.01 ETH rather than requiring a solid enough graphics card or CPU as well as enough technical knowledge;

* it ensures you're not just subsidizing big mining farms through economies of scale letting them produce way more hashes than you and thus getting way more voting power to create blocks more frequently and earn rewards more frequently than you proportionately to funds invested;

* it ensures you're not easy to spot on the electrical grid even once you've got a substantial amount of consensus voting power, which means you can choose not to doxx yourself and make sure you're not subjected to the whims of any coercive group to become a malevolent consensus actor despite yourself; 

* it ensures you're not participating into a chain which has no control over its electrical consumption and risks attracting the angry focus of the mob as soon as its native token price goes so high electrical consumption starts negatively impacting consumer needs in electricity. 

As such, the only consensus actors that have an interest in PoW are the biggest consensus actors having short-term interest in mind or the malevolent ones."	14a43ab90c8f2d9f93ebd05c58a86343379d6de2	True	False					0	1666822706		0	{}	itwy4py	False	t3_ye1xnk	False	True	t3_ye1xnk	/r/ethereum/comments/ye1xnk/pow_or_pos/itwy4py/	1666822720	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]			i ll assume you were trying to mean for consensus actors which mechanism has the most advantages please clarify if that wasn t your intent as i otherwise don t understand the reference to miners in pos for the situation of most consensus actors it s pos which has the best advantages because it s much more sustainable long term to ensure the issuance stays relevant and worth it since pow requires a huge maintenance cost the network has to continuously pay for it s a lot less vulnerable to consensus attacks which ensures the chain is way more secure long term as a consensus actor it ensures you don t need either lots of funds invested in mining equipment or a pool to receive rewards frequently enough to be profitable instead you only need up to 32 eth a lot less than what s required to reasonably mine by yourself without lots of operational costs it ensures you can start being part of the process with as low as 0 01 eth rather than requiring a solid enough graphics card or cpu as well as enough technical knowledge it ensures you re not just subsidizing big mining farms through economies of scale letting them produce way more hashes than you and thus getting way more voting power to create blocks more frequently and earn rewards more frequently than you proportionately to funds invested it ensures you re not easy to spot on the electrical grid even once you ve got a substantial amount of consensus voting power which means you can choose not to doxx yourself and make sure you re not subjected to the whims of any coercive group to become a malevolent consensus actor despite yourself it ensures you re not participating into a chain which has no control over its electrical consumption and risks attracting the angry focus of the mob as soon as its native token price goes so high electrical consumption starts negatively impacting consumer needs in electricity as such the only consensus actors that have an interest in pow are the biggest consensus actors having short term interest in mind or the malevolent ones 	0.0023547078017145395	0.988502025604248	0.713649332523346	0.013866934925317764	0.00894950982183218	0.40296241641044617	0.07605768740177155	8.593385132371623e-07	0.4992533028125763	0.0053038387559354305

You can legally deploy a new instance of Tornado Cash with or without modifications. OFAC sanctioned the addresses not the software.

If you're not from or in the US you shouldn't need to comply with the sanctions. But don't get cute, for instance if you're American but you control a shell company in Aruba, it's probably not safe to transact and say the shell company did it.

The practical risk for Tornado Cash users in the free world is that if we send our money through Tornado Cash then try to deposit in a centralized exchange, they may refuse it and/or close our account.

It was always known that withdrawals would be delayed until *after* the merge. There was no scam here. This was known upfront.

Increasing energy production in itself isn't what I was talking about. Sorry if I wasn't clear enough. Because, again, the issue isn't in absolute electricity amounts. Rather, it's in costs, because it's in costs that lies security in PoW. 

&gt;I don’t know that you explicitly mentioned dropping issuance over time, but that’s part of the protocol so I will assume that you are accounting for that.

I even explicitely accounted for that. 

&gt;Most people who have spent significant time studying POW (including some supporters of POS) are significantly more concerned with the security budget being too low.

This is an appeal to authority fallacy. Where are they? Are they pretending spending trillions is even better than what we're spending now? Who are they? Why do they think spending even more is desired? 

&gt;Your stance seems to be the opposite and the onus is on you to clearly describe that position.

Which I fortunately did. Besides, my stance isn't that it's too secure at all. My stance is that security level shouldn't be dictated in any way by token price, as it otherwise means that a too high token price increase will force the market to solve that problem miners don't want to solve in ways miners won't be pleased with. 

This stance exists outside of any concern about security level being too high, too low or acceptable. Just as much as it exists outside of any concern about the environment.

But, the zkEVM will have its gas fees paid in ETH (I really like that personally). If you're curious for more info, this is a really awesome read:

It won't answer your question directly, but it is really worthwhile. It brings up some very interesting points multiple times regarding Polygon PoS and Solana- and makes a really good case for the Polygon zkEVM. 

Personally I think it will drive more eyes to the Polygon ecosystem and that will help the token, but as discussed in that Reddit post it seems like there is just a ton of sell pressure on MATIC so probably going to be a really slow growing token compared to the level of adoption it garners"	740d8b2c0f02d26c067becfcd21156d253d8c5e5	True	False					0	1666755634		0	{}	ittb7wc	False	t3_ydcu7w	False	True	t1_itsvluf	/r/ethereum/comments/ydcu7w/the_polygon_matic_pos_commit_chain_has_brought/ittb7wc/	1666755648	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]			always research on your own but i really don t know it s the defacto token representing the polyogn ecosystem and polygon has an incentive to grow it the matic will still be used for the pos network staking amp governance amp x200b but the zkevm will have its gas fees paid in eth i really like that personally if you re curious for more info this is a really awesome read https www reddit com r ethfinance comments pk57n7 why rollups data shards are the only sustainable https www reddit com r ethfinance comments pk57n7 why rollups data shards are the only sustainable amp x200b it won t answer your question directly but it is really worthwhile it brings up some very interesting points multiple times regarding polygon pos and solana and makes a really good case for the polygon zkevm personally i think it will drive more eyes to the polygon ecosystem and that will help the token but as discussed in that reddit post it seems like there is just a ton of sell pressure on matic so probably going to be a really slow growing token compared to the level of adoption it garners	0.0026112450286746025	0.988917350769043	0.5338553786277771	0.03599802777171135	0.007905346341431141	0.2729288935661316	0.09356378018856049	8.485076818942616e-07	0.2257184535264969	0.018332457169890404
