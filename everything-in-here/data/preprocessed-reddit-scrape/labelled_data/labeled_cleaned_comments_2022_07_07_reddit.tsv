The value proposition is clear. It may become in the blockchain were many transactions are settled, therefore, becoming a currency of said ecosystem. 

The monetary base of a currency is equal to the volume of transactions multiplied by the velocity of the currency. This is an economic concepto. 

Therefore the higher capacity and higher adoption, much higher number of volume of transactions. Solana is ideal for financial layer as it has the TPS and the velocity. And staking reduces the velocity.

At current fee levels, we would need to have ~100X more average TPS than today to break even on long-term inflation of SOL (if I’m remembering my calculations correctly, on mobile so don’t have my spreadsheet). This is not inconceivable, as SOL could be used for transactions in many different markets and certain transactions (I.e. minting an NFT or buying an options contract) are not single transactions on SOL and require multiple fees to be paid to complete. However, there is technical risk in scaling to this level, as network bandwidth would need to increase to support 250-300k transactions per second. The SOL team has the right technical background to accomplish this, but this is still a very real risk to consider. 

The other big unknown is how variable fee markets will impact fee revenue. There is a current proposal to create local fee markets, I.e. if everyone is trying to mint an NFT at once, then fees only increase for those trying to mint. If this works, it would increase fee revenue (and thus SOL burn) while preventing the chain from becoming globally expensive during big market events (huge problem on ETH). If the team is able to implement this successfully, this could dramatically lower the breakeven amount of transactions needed to blunt inflation.

My thought (and the reason I accumulated during this “build” market) is that a large component of SOL’s price is simply the demand to hold the coin via adoption of the underlying network (the “blockchain”).  If/as more entities adopt Solana’s network, then modern law of supply and demand suggests that people would have to pay whatever someone’s willing to sell their supply for.

E.g. If someone paid $100 per SOL back in 2021, then they may only be willing to sell their bag for $120 per SOL.  And if that’s the lowest/only price available for a SOL at an arbitrary point in time, then that’s simply what a buyer would have to pay.

E.g. (2) Likewise, if last month someone bought at $30 per SOL, and they think the future of Solana is as great as they say, then they may not be willing to sell their bag until they believe they’ve seen an ROI greater than or analogous to 2021’s value of SOL.

All other explanations aside, the cumulative impact of these types of hypothetical investors alone would drive the price of SOL up.

It’s important to remember that a newborn market like crypto will inherently be more volatile than other risk-on assets due to lack of understanding, adoption, posers, etc. and performing DD exactly as you are with this thread is all you can ask for at this time.

&gt;  
&gt;I'm personally not very interested in DeFi thus would rather participate in securing, and be part of the network. But this is exactly my point: you can't except you have a big bag of DOTs which push you up in the rank, you stake on an exchange or use other DeFi solutions like Acala/Parallel  which require more in-depth knowledge.

  
I think there's a misconception on the usage of the parachains apps when it comes to staking. You do not need to participate in any DeFi if you want to only use Liquid Staking. This action would result in you securing the same network (much like you stated), therefore achieving the ""regular Joe with 130 DOT participating in securing the network"" scenario. Actually, to be more precise, a regular Joe with 5 DOT in our case.  The only difference between this liquid staking and the direct on-chain staking would be the loss of governance participation rights (you'd be pretty much delegating your DOTs in this flow, much like any other regular DPoS network works).  

A user would only have to do more research into the specific protocol's DeFi rules and settings if they intend to participate in any of the DeFi specific activities, such as:  Lending, Borrowing, Minting, LPing for DEXs, etc. 

Until Nominating Pools are being released on Polkadot (they still have to go through Kusama phase as far as I know) however, I do agree that the current 125 DOT is a high barrier to entry for someone that wants to participate in both on-chain staking and governance.

It appears to me that Acala is using the terms that the community got most used to during 2020 and 2021, in their DeFi app.  I assume this was in order to help with adoption, ease-of-use, etc.  

For example, the usage of the term ""staking"" in their Liquid Provider Pools (Earn tab) is personally irking me very much,  but I get it to some extent. People kept calling any reward gaining ""staking"" at some point early last year, regardless if it had anything to do with protocol staking.

458	[]	False		Parking_Air7094			[]				text	t2_fslsv83a	False	False	"Most of Polkadot's parachains are fairly legit.  While they don't advertise, there appears to be alot of coordination behind the scenes that I don't think most people probably recognize on the surface.  Could be wrong.  For example, I would make the argument that the first 20 parachains are not competitors against each other at all (doubt that was by accident....lol).  They all have very specific purposes from a functionality perspective, from geographic perspective, and from a redundancy perspective.  Let me give just a few examples:

\- Acala - Located in Australia/New Zealand Area

\- Parallel Finance - Located in the United States

\- Bifrost - Located in Singapore.

Each is going to market to their respective geographic locations.  Further, all of them provide or will provide liquid staking solutions.  Some might argue that they are competing against each other in that service; however, I would make an argument that they are decentralizing, building redundancy, and ensuring no single point of failure if a black swan event occurred.  Also, Acala provides stablecoin capability and parallel finance provides crowdloan capability.  There are many, many examples like these when you start researching the projects.

Now in my own personal opinion (not investment advice), if I was going to theoretically pick one parachain that I thought would do well.  I would hands down pick Acala.  It is backed by Digital Currency Group and has hundreds of millions behind it and with good reason.  Forget about all the defi protocols that will be on it (and there will be alot).  Its stablecoin functionality by itself could make its market cap be worth a fortune long term.  

The recipe looks something like this:

\- Other blockchains will adopt the aUSD stablecoin (there is a 250M adoption program), which should create massive demand for the stablecoin (this creates downstream supply chain demand - see bullet below)

\- In order to mint the aUSD stablecoin, you need to use over collateralized assets to borrow against it (the main asset is DOT - which makes its value go up as well :)

\- The interest on borrowing is paid for in Acala USD (this is done behind the scenes with the Homa protocol).  Think of it this way, if you minted $3B of assets using total collateral of $10B, then you would need to pay about 3% on the $3B on a yearly basis in Acala, which is subsequently burned.  That is $90M in buy pressure for a $240 fully diluted market cap and that $90M is burned.  What do you think happens to the price?

\- Acala itself can be used as collateral to borrow aUSD, so you can see that this has a positive cyclical effect.

\-Unlike Luna Terra, which experienced the dreaded death sprilal, Acala has built in mechanisms to prevent this from happening beyond its over collateralization.  When the collateral starts to get liquidated because of a downtown, the liquidation penalty has to be paid for in Acala (also burned), which means upward pressure on the price.

Anyway, I stake eth, dot, atom, matic and each and every one of them has pros and cons. Using your example, ATOM, staking does not provide the network with any other benefit besides marketing. ATOM staking secures the Cosmos Hub and that's it, which is fairly centralized to begin with (hence doesn't need much decentralized security), it doesn't secure any of the Cosmos blockchains. 

Plus on Cosmos, much like any other DPoS,  governance is automatically assigned to the validator you select. This is another thing that I dislike. There are options to avoid this since you can manually override the vote done by your validator on your behalf,  but this doesn't seem like a model on which a decentralized governance can be achieved.

2x very popular validators (a lot of own stake, always online, etc) that is picked by a lot of users with over 500 DOT bonded, therefore potentially pushing you out of the top256 nominators for these validators, for the respective eras

10x validators that barely get selected in those eras, therefore miss a bunch of era rewards due to your nomination being with these  ""waiting validators""
