This is the proper response to the energy FUD. Here's how I explained it to a co-worker the other day who was concerned about bitcoins energy usage.

Bitcoin uses too little energy and it really needs to use a lot more. Since energy so important and very scarce right now we tend to fight over it. Imagine if humanity started capturing most of the worlds natural energy like solar, geo-thermal, hydro-electric, etc to mine bitcoin and secure the network. The ideal goal would be to incentivize capturing nearly all of the worlds natural energy like a massive super grid . That massive power source could be used for space exploration or any other humanitarian needs. Texas is using miners to be able to provide extra power during surges because the miners will happily turn off their rigs when needed. Roughly 95% the worlds energy could be used to mine bitcoin and the other 5% could be used to power the rest of the world with abundant clean energy. The entire world would have access to free energy to grow food, heat their homes, cooling, enjoy life, etc. and at this point you have something truly beautiful; bitcoin would essentially be decentralization backed by physics.

Let that sink in.

Property rights, rule of law, money all backed by physics. Trust in physics, math and code instead of governments. History could be written in blocks and the integrity of the data would be undeniable.

Proof of work is beautiful. Anyone against it is probably just naive and doesn't quite fully understand the ramifications of a truly decentralized consensus mechanism or they are simply a tyrant.

HODL. Rules not rulers. Not your keys, not your coins. Vires in Numeris. Freedom will prevail."

Here's how I explained it to a co-worker the other day who was concerned about bitcoins energy usage.

Bitcoin uses too little energy and it really needs to use a lot more. Since energy so important and very scarce right now we tend to fight over it. Imagine if humanity started capturing most of the worlds natural and energy like solar, geo-thermal, hydro-electric, etc to mine bitcoin and secure the network. The ideal goal would be to incentivize capturing nearly all of the worlds natural energy like a massive super grid . That massive power source could be used for space exploration or any other humanitarian needs. Texas is using miners to be able to provide extra power sources for power surge needs and because the miners will happily turn off their rigs to help people. Roughly 95% the worlds energy could be used to mine bitcoin and the other 5% could be used to power the rest of the world with abundant clean energy. The entire world would have access to free energy to grow food, heat their homes, cooling, enjoy life, etc. and at this point you have something truly beautiful; bitcoin would essentially be decentralization backed by physics. 

Let that sink in.

Property rights, rule of law, money all backed by physics. Trust in physics, math and code instead of governments. History could be written in blocks and the integrity of the data would be undeniable.

Proof of work is beautiful. Anyone against it is probably just naive and doesn't quite fully understand the ramifications of a truly decentralized consensus mechanism or they are simply a tyrant.

It’s sad to see that we can barely go a day without hearing about another NFT rug-pull, grift or crypto-scam. Web3 was founded on the idea of a new decentralized internet in which we take back control from the big players and build something of-for-and-by the people.

There are so many good ideals:

\- Privacy

\- Creators getting paid what they're worth

\- Taking back control from centralized players

\- Freedom of expression

However, this whole concept seems to just be good marketing with no real substance. It’s as if the idea of putting us in charge of our future is just good marketing to get us to buy into the next big grift.

&amp;#x200B;

**Let’s take privacy, for example:**

Web3 allows us to be anonymous by allowing anyone to create a new wallet address and start a new list of transactions. However, we're in a situation where scammers are able to run wild and create new identities each time they get exposed. There are now whole “NFT factories” doing these scams on rinse-and-repeat because it’s so easy.

Not only that, for ordinary people, an immutable blockchain address is a terrible idea for privacy. As you use the address, more and more personal information gets attached to it, and it becomes a public database of what you do. Do we really want everyone in the world to see everything we're doing? What we own? Every transaction we make? And what if someone sends a picture of our front door to our address? Or even an indecent photo? You have no recourse, no civility, no humanity at all.

When has decentralization done anything for privacy anyway? A decentralized system is not only more easy to exploit but very difficult to patch and update.

&amp;#x200B;

**Usability:**

The only thing making the blockchain usable by any ordinary person right now is centralized parties like Coinbase. Why hasn't the technology been made with usability from the ground up? Doesn't this defeat the whole purpose?

&amp;#x200B;

**An interoperable metaverse:**

I can't even begin to list issues with this, so I'm just going to send you to a video: [https://youtu.be/I5ao5AwZLZY?t=378](https://youtu.be/I5ao5AwZLZY?t=378)

I’d like to say one thing… calling your semi-functional virtual world a “Metaverse” to sell “land” is deeply disingenuous.

&amp;#x200B;

**A bad foundation:**

I get it, we're all tired of companies like Facebook doing things they shouldn't with our data, but the ideas Web3 is founded on are fundamentally flawed. Decentralization does not create either community or privacy.

We need a future that puts people in control. A future based on ideas that will have a reasonable chance against massive centralized corporate pushes and walled gardens.

&amp;#x200B;

**A different take:**

Right now I'm in decentralized game development, but I'd love to team up with people who are passionate about the \*ideals\* of Web3 and research the creation of something new.

My idea is to gather people who want to make a difference and build a centralized, bespoke, usable, foundation for the Metaverse. Namely, something that functions like Wikipedia, with similar values to open source. The end goal would be a private, people-first virtual experience.

[Audio version/TL;DR &gt;&gt;](https://www.jotform.com/app/220476173895970)

It’s sad to see that we can barely go a day without hearing about another NFT rug-pull, grift or crypto-scam. Web3 was founded on the idea of a new decentralized internet in which we take back control from the big players and build something of-for-and-by the people.

There are so many good ideals:

\- Privacy

\- Creators getting paid what they're worth

\- Taking back control from centralized players

\- Freedom of expression

However, this whole concept seems to just be good marketing with no real substance. It’s as if the idea of putting us in charge of our future is just good marketing to get us to buy into the next big grift.

&amp;#x200B;

**Let’s take privacy, for example:**

Web3 allows us to be anonymous by allowing anyone to create a new wallet address and start a new list of transactions. However, we're in a situation where scammers are able to run wild and create new identities each time they get exposed. There are now whole “NFT factories” doing these scams on rinse-and-repeat because it’s so easy.

Not only that, for ordinary people, an immutable blockchain address is a terrible idea for privacy. As you use the address, more and more personal information gets attached to it, and it becomes a public database of what you do. Do we really want everyone in the world to see everything we're doing? What we own? Every transaction we make? And what if someone sends a picture of our front door to our address? Or even an indecent photo? You have no recourse, no civility, no humanity at all.

When has decentralization done anything for privacy anyway? A decentralized system is not only more easy to exploit but very difficult to patch and update.

&amp;#x200B;

**Usability:**

The only thing making the blockchain usable by any ordinary person right now is centralized parties like Coinbase. Why hasn't the technology been made with usability from the ground up? Doesn't this defeat the whole purpose?

&amp;#x200B;

**An interoperable metaverse:**

I can't even begin to list issues with this, so I'm just going to send you to a video: [https://youtu.be/I5ao5AwZLZY?t=378](https://youtu.be/I5ao5AwZLZY?t=378)

I’d like to say one thing… calling your semi-functional virtual world a “Metaverse” to sell “land” is deeply disingenuous.

&amp;#x200B;

**A bad foundation:**

I get it, we're all tired of companies like Facebook doing things they shouldn't with our data, but the ideas Web3 is founded on are fundamentally flawed. Decentralization does not create either community or privacy.

We need a future that puts people in control. A future based on ideas that will have a reasonable chance against massive centralized corporate pushes and walled gardens.

&amp;#x200B;

**A different take:**

Right now I'm in decentralized game development, but I'd love to team up with people who are passionate about the \*ideals\* of Web3 and research the creation of something new.

My idea is to gather people who want to make a difference and build a centralized, bespoke, usable, foundation for the Metaverse. Namely, something that functions like Wikipedia, with similar values to open source. The end goal would be a private, people-first virtual experience.

When your life is on the line, tangible assets (like food, bullets, fuel, etc) will always prevail.

\-------

I see many people arguing over the relative merits of bitcoin versus fiat in times of war/crisis/etc.

Since the very unfortunate people of Ukraine are involved in the first conflict where this has come up on any real scale though, clearly no one can speak with certainty on this issue yet. 

That said, I suspect the likely answer (at this point in time) is that it would depend on the amounts in question.

Since fiat is currently more widely accepted, people are probably still wise to keep practical amounts of physical cash (1k$-$5k USD or equivalent) for desperate times. They should expect to pay much higher prices for goods though, as cash (or any intangible asset) quickly loses value in times of scarcity and bartering quickly becomes the norm. After all, neither fiat nor bitcoin (nor gold, etc) will be of much use relative to food and fuel if you're starving or freezing to death. I personally would be very hesitant to accept fiat in such circumstances as it can be both quite easily counterfeited or stolen from me by others. But that's just me and fully acknowledge the fact I'm comfortable with using bitcoin already.

So what about bitcoin during these uncertain times? Yes, there have been encouraging stories about people selling cars for bitcoin and this is what I imagine the future of such conflicts will look like once it becomes as widely accepted as fiat. But the true value is in *actual wealth* preservation. Think you're going to be able to carry your retirement accounts across the border in cash? Think you can pick up your vacation home and move it to somewhere else? Hard to carry fine art, jewelry, or gold bullion on your back when you're fleeing for your life or crossing borders riddled with guards with sticky fingers. 

This is where the real use case for bitcoin is as far as I'm concerned. Large amounts of wealth that can now easily travel with you anywhere in the world, at any time. It is truly an unbelievable invention in this regard.

Of course, it would be unreasonable to expect such a system to work if only the ""good guys"" get to use it. Indeed, bitcoin will likely be used to circumvent sanctions, buy illicit goods, etc. But so will cash. And only one system can truly claim to protect the wealth of every human on earth who cares to use it and preserve its value into the future. 

Is it volatile in the near term? Yup, so is cash. Will volatility matter when you have a gun to your head or your government turns against you?

I see many people arguing over the relative merits of bitcoin versus fiat in times of war/crisis/etc.

Since the very unfortunate people of Ukraine are involved in the first conflict where this has come up on any real scale though, clearly no one can speak with certainty on this issue yet. 

That said, I suspect the likely answer (at this point in time) is that it would depend on the amounts in question.

Since fiat is currently more widely accepted, people are probably still wise to keep practical amounts of physical cash (1k$-$5k USD or equivalent) for desperate times. They should expect to pay much higher prices for goods though, as cash (or any intangible asset) quickly loses value in times of scarcity and bartering quickly becomes the norm. After all, neither fiat nor bitcoin (nor gold, etc) will be of much use relative to food and fuel if you're starving or freezing to death. I personally would be very hesitant to accept fiat in such circumstances as it can be both quite easily counterfeited or stolen from me by others. But that's just me and fully acknowledge the fact I'm comfortable with using bitcoin already.

So what about bitcoin during these uncertain times? Yes, there have been encouraging stories about people selling cars for bitcoin and this is what I imagine the future of such conflicts will look like once it becomes as widely accepted as fiat. But the true value is in *actual wealth* preservation. Think you're going to be able to carry your retirement accounts across the border in cash? Think you can pick up your vacation home and move it to somewhere else? Hard to carry fine art, jewelry, or gold bullion on your back when you're fleeing for your life or crossing borders riddled with guards with sticky fingers. 

This is where the real use case for bitcoin is as far as I'm concerned. Large amounts of wealth that can now easily travel with you anywhere in the world, at any time. It is truly an unbelievable invention in this regard.

Of course, it would be unreasonable to expect such a system to work if only the ""good guys"" get to use it. Indeed, bitcoin will likely be used to circumvent sanctions, buy illicit goods, etc. But so will cash. And only one system can truly claim to protect the wealth of every human on earth who cares to use it and preserve its value into the future.

Ask the people of Russia or Ukraine what they think about that now."	fiat versus bitcoin during war tl dr bitcoin is great for both large and small amounts fiat is only good for small amounts when your life is on the line tangible assets like food bullets fuel etc will always prevail i see many people arguing over the relative merits of bitcoin versus fiat in times of war crisis etc since the very unfortunate people of ukraine are involved in the first conflict where this has come up on any real scale though clearly no one can speak with certainty on this issue yet that said i suspect the likely answer at this point in time is that it would depend on the amounts in question since fiat is currently more widely accepted people are probably still wise to keep practical amounts of physical cash 1k 5k usd or equivalent for desperate times they should expect to pay much higher prices for goods though as cash or any intangible asset quickly loses value in times of scarcity and bartering quickly becomes the norm after all neither fiat nor bitcoin nor gold etc will be of much use relative to food and fuel if you re starving or freezing to death i personally would be very hesitant to accept fiat in such circumstances as it can be both quite easily counterfeited or stolen from me by others but that s just me and fully acknowledge the fact i m comfortable with using bitcoin already so what about bitcoin during these uncertain times yes there have been encouraging stories about people selling cars for bitcoin and this is what i imagine the future of such conflicts will look like once it becomes as widely accepted as fiat but the true value is in actual wealth preservation think you re going to be able to carry your retirement accounts across the border in cash think you can pick up your vacation home and move it to somewhere else hard to carry fine art jewelry or gold bullion on your back when you re fleeing for your life or crossing borders riddled with guards with sticky fingers this is where the real use case for bitcoin is as far as i m concerned large amounts of wealth that can now easily travel with you anywhere in the world at any time it is truly an unbelievable invention in this regard of course it would be unreasonable to expect such a system to work if only the good guys get to use it indeed bitcoin will likely be used to circumvent sanctions buy illicit goods etc but so will cash and only one system can truly claim to protect the wealth of every human on earth who cares to use it and preserve its value into the future is it volatile in the near term yup so is cash will volatility matter when you have a gun to your head or your government turns against you ask the people of russia or ukraine what they think about that now 	0.0025813644751906395	0.9880449175834656	0.9378857612609863	0.025026638060808182	0.008692450821399689	0.43489617109298706	0.05059141665697098	8.459930995741161e-07	0.3353409171104431	0.02178298495709896
