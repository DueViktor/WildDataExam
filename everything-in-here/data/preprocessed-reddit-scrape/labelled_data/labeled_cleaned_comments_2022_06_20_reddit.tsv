They will sell you a computer for ETH, their old motorcycle, a car, anything for ETH.  We have just witnessed our government betray us, and erase more than 16% of our wages AND our lifetimes of savings by tampering with money in circulation, causing rapid inflation.  Then, they tampered again, and induced a market crash, which stole away nearly 30% of people's actual balances in their retirement accounts.  And if a recession is induced, by yet further tampering, then we'll have to pay 25% in ""income tax"" and 10% for ""tax penalties"" to gain access to our retirement savings at the most desperate times in our lives.  The point is, currencies that cannot be tampered with, that are NOT centralized, that cannot be minted anew at the will of a few rich old men, are intrinsically more stable, more trustable store of wealthy.  The ONLY reason it doesn't seem that way, yet is because the valuation of the dollar is so very rapidly fluctuating and people are still running around blindly trying to find a way to preserve their earnings and their hard earned savings.

so first I 100% agree that saving private information on central servers is a NO-GO! I even often to refer to the horrible implementation of the Indian central identity system, ""Aadhaar"". Due to corruption and system design, 1 billion people were affected by hack, making it easy to steal someone's identity, while locking the real person out of social security services. There were instances that people died of being denied access to health care. As a former development worker, this makes me still furious and why I'm a believer into web3.   
When I referred to having some data stored on a central point, I was not implying that identifiable private information should be stored there, but ONLY the transaction history between a few known government actors.  
All personal verifiable information should be only on the individuals' device.  
A reason why I also brought up the option to have central entities is, that many government officials I spoke to, either said that a certain „semi-private-network“ is a necessary step (for now).  
On the other hand, developers agreed that the current state of blockchains did not allow a solid business case to have costs that can be forecasted reliable.   
I believe that a fully decentralized identity system would be a great benefit for society so that we can fulfil a truly humanistic information &amp; data economy (I´m referring to Jaron Laniers ideas in ""Who owns the future?"").

A tumbler is designed to introduce a level of obfuscation, by having you send your funds from the source wallet into a shared pool, and then pulling your funds out of the pool using the destination wallet.

This works by both indirectly transferring funds from one wallet to another through the pool, and hiding this indirect transfer among a number of other user's transfers. This means that it's much more difficult to correlate source and destination wallets, because all you see is a number of wallets withdrawing funds from the tumbler, without any indication of who they are or what wallet those funds were deposited from.

Obviously this isn't a foolproof solution, there are a number of vulnerabilities that the authorities can exploit (and/or incompetent users can fall victim to) to correlate a user's deposits with suspicious withdrawals (especially when large sums of money are involved, as it's generally harder to move large sums through a tumbler, making them easier to track), but it is *a* solution."	5515f87fbecc944e82f0279100b185b840c3ee53	True	False					0	1655653885		0	{}	icyebd0	False	t3_vfl20r	False	True	t1_icy5jlr	/r/ethereum/comments/vfl20r/what_will_be_a_use_of_eth_that_makes_it_a_500/icyebd0/	1655653904	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		you re correct but that s not what tumblers like tornado cash are designed to break a tumbler is designed to introduce a level of obfuscation by having you send your funds from the source wallet into a shared pool and then pulling your funds out of the pool using the destination wallet this works by both indirectly transferring funds from one wallet to another through the pool and hiding this indirect transfer among a number of other user s transfers this means that it s much more difficult to correlate source and destination wallets because all you see is a number of wallets withdrawing funds from the tumbler without any indication of who they are or what wallet those funds were deposited from obviously this isn t a foolproof solution there are a number of vulnerabilities that the authorities can exploit and or incompetent users can fall victim to to correlate a user s deposits with suspicious withdrawals especially when large sums of money are involved as it s generally harder to move large sums through a tumbler making them easier to track but it is a solution 	0.002367111388593912	0.9895182251930237	0.4851053059101105	0.01882968470454216	0.007506139576435089	0.25417062640190125	0.06265214830636978	8.616707987130212e-07	0.36906492710113525	0.025419872254133224

So the cost of us having a banking system, which allows me to pay you money and you to provide me with a thing in return, the cost of our current system is the gross revenue of all the following global industries:

- Banking. Gross revenue of all banks in the world.
- securities. The gross revenue of all the stock firms, all the stock exchanges, all the hedge funds, all the Goldman Sachs etc. 
- insurance. All the administration costs, sales fees, shareholder profit, claims declined unjustly, everything beyond the premiums collected vs claims paid out. For all insurance companies in the whole world
- energy distribution. We don't need for profit utilties to own or operate the electrical grid, when I can sell you my solar electricity in a trustless, automatic manner.

- visa/MasterCard, the forex industry, the foreign workers sending money home industry, etc

I would wager the number, the surplus cost that we all pay for these things is in the trillions of dollars per year. As an example, American banks charge 12Billion  just in overdraft fees. What the fuck.

The transaction on the million dollar contract will be much higher in value, so people doing those transactions have no problem paying dozens or hundreds of dollars worth of ETH in gas since that's a tiny % of a high-value transaction. And they get secure settlement and finality out of it.

With the NFT game contract, the willingness to pay hundreds in gas fees is definitely not there since playing that game is presumably low-value. Instead that stuff gets pushed to rollups where fees are much lowers, and hundreds/thousands of similar low value transactions are aggregated into one batch on L1 that is itself a high-value transaction - the sequencer is willing pay hundreds in gas fees because that's still a net profit after summing up all the tiny fees they collected from low-value L2 transactions.

In both cases, those high fees are captured by Ethereum and burned and lowers Ether supply inflation, and the portion that's not burned goes to stakers so you need even less inflation [to attract more stakers to result in more security and more data capacity for L2s](https://i.imgur.com/CAycxbt.png).

decentralization has zero value in that case.  A centralized database   
would do just fine.

At the very minimum they would eliminate escrow fees.

On ETH a house purchase can be done in an atomic transaction (the house and the money change owner in the same transaction) thus making it impossible for the seller to run away with the money before they have transferred ownership of the house. So no more need for an escrow agent.

1. Tokenized properties, are actually not tokenized, they are incorporated into SPVs.

2. This is a costly process and reduces adoption. Furthermore, there is a public distrust in crypto, which unfortunately, latches onto blockchain.

3. The lack of properties listed, either due to cost or trust, creates a cycle of less investors, less properties and so on..

4. The lack of participation can only solved by a central authority. Land registries.

5. If a central authority intervenes, then the usability of blockchain is reduced since its foundation is based on the principle of decentralization.

I do use Polkadot js to review validators before selecting.  Network- staking- targets is the path (I think). I try to choose ones with under 256 nominators.

Inflation is 100% necessary for people to use an eco system continously.

14% staking rewards less 8% inflation means your portion of DOT is gaining 6% over the increase in supply each year. Very few other proof of stake protocols offer anywhere near this.

And due to that people aren't scared to use their dot's, like a lot of other eco systems. When was the last time a normal retail user spent a day doing 10-15 transactions on the ethereum network?
