My problem with borrowing huge amounts of money is the interest owed on the loan over time can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars, then there is the duration which is usually 15 or 30 years.

It’s not a stretch to say people with less means (excess funds) to invest *on average* likely possess less investment expertise but of course it’s wrong to make sweeping generalizations.

I saw one of these ATMs in the wild (was in a poorer area in the middle of nowhere central California FWIW.) For a 90k sats withdrawal the fee was ~18k sats. You can draw your own conclusions from that. It reminded me of predatory paycheck lenders whose profits rely on the unbanked spending inordinate %s in fees because they lack the option to avoid them. And I haven’t seen many of these ATMs in more affluent areas of LA. IME, people in more affluent areas use cash considerably less (like not at all for most people I know.) 

I think the main point was these are a ripoff.

But the reasons I hold is we already have institutional investment and adoption. In simplest terms, people/institutions already invested in Bitcoin won't let Bitcoin fail. The recent institutional selloffs were in my view shorts, meaning good, meaning they bought back in at the bottom and will never allow us to see the bottom again. Cities are mining BTC. The US federal government holds a shit ton of BTC.  


Additionally, after the next halving in 2024 bitcoin will be the rarest traded commodity on earth. There is value is rarity, literally no matter what it is.   


Finally, BTC is finally moving toward being used as actual money with all of the debit cards that use BTC transactionally. BTC may never really be used as money unless we decouple the idea it's value is derived from it's relationship to fiat money and start to charge set prices in Sats for goods, but the adoption is none the less exciting. If you can get your paycheck in BTC and spend it like money, those are great signs consumer investment outside of the speculative is on the horizon.   


There is no guarantee BTC will ever reach it's all time highs again, but it's already beyond the point you need to worry about it going to zero and staying there imo.

This is very easy to see as false since the data is publicly available.

&gt;Even with as cheap as it is, no one wants to use it. AWS, GCP, Azure etc are growing at breakneck speeds.

Baseless claim. 

&gt;If Golem was a viable alternative with meaningful benefits over centralized services, the customers would be there.

&gt;Everything you say only exists in some decentralized utopia where no one wants to make any money. In reality though there is ZERO incentive to put any meaningful resources on Golem because Golem has not proven to be of any use to companies who actually need these resources.

This is circular logic again: ""It's useless, so no one uses it, so there's nothing to see and no one should use it.""

What I notice is you completely dodged all my arguments to assert unbacked claimed and circular logic fallacies. Decentralization isn't any utopia. Utopia is believing corporations that have no interest in providing best prices will somehow do so, as if virtue was constantly expected from them. 

&gt;You say AWS not being on Golem means they can't compete. Um, no, it's the opposite. It means Golem isn't competition and thus AWS has no need to be on Golem.

I have explained how. You dodged it to just claim this without any argument.

&gt;The market doesn't lie. Golem has no demand. No one is stopping Golem from growing. No one is stopping Nvidia from adding resources to Golem. No one is stopping all these big crypto miners from moving resources to Golem.

I'll tell you one thing you seem to forget about markets: knowledge assymetry. If you were right and there was no knowledge assymetry, no one would have used Bitcoin or valued it more than a few cents simply because no one wanted to use it for years. Yet here we are. Not only has Bitcoin proven that decentralization always dynamically provides as much as demand asks for, contrary to what you claimed, but it has also shown that something that isn't yet valued as demanded value by the market can be demanded later. 

It's just as if you were not understanding what markets are at all. Do you know what you're talking about? I mean, knowledge assymetry is a pretty known property of markets. It's curious you're completely disregarding it to resort to circular logic fallacies."	2c908f19ba9e32724ae3153f8577c362d88641c3	True	False					0	1656163459		0	{}	idony7v	False	t3_vhscdb	False	True	t1_idol2o4	/r/ethereum/comments/vhscdb/i_feel_like_no_one_outside_of_our_industry/idony7v/	1656163472	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]			 gt you re just denying the reality of it golem exists and has existed for years no one uses it and no one makes any money from it even with as cheap as it is no one wants to use it this is very easy to see as false since the data is publicly available gt even with as cheap as it is no one wants to use it aws gcp azure etc are growing at breakneck speeds baseless claim gt if golem was a viable alternative with meaningful benefits over centralized services the customers would be there gt everything you say only exists in some decentralized utopia where no one wants to make any money in reality though there is zero incentive to put any meaningful resources on golem because golem has not proven to be of any use to companies who actually need these resources this is circular logic again it s useless so no one uses it so there s nothing to see and no one should use it what i notice is you completely dodged all my arguments to assert unbacked claimed and circular logic fallacies decentralization isn t any utopia utopia is believing corporations that have no interest in providing best prices will somehow do so as if virtue was constantly expected from them gt you say aws not being on golem means they can t compete um no it s the opposite it means golem isn t competition and thus aws has no need to be on golem i have explained how you dodged it to just claim this without any argument gt the market doesn t lie golem has no demand no one is stopping golem from growing no one is stopping nvidia from adding resources to golem no one is stopping all these big crypto miners from moving resources to golem i ll tell you one thing you seem to forget about markets knowledge assymetry if you were right and there was no knowledge assymetry no one would have used bitcoin or valued it more than a few cents simply because no one wanted to use it for years yet here we are not only has bitcoin proven that decentralization always dynamically provides as much as demand asks for contrary to what you claimed but it has also shown that something that isn t yet valued as demanded value by the market can be demanded later it s just as if you were not understanding what markets are at all do you know what you re talking about i mean knowledge assymetry is a pretty known property of markets it s curious you re completely disregarding it to resort to circular logic fallacies 	0.001981534995138645	0.9890331029891968	0.8659669756889343	0.027621272951364517	0.007053144741803408	0.16388972103595734	0.10020923614501953	8.611335147179489e-07	0.46141576766967773	0.0021303975954651833

Besides the centralization of pools, the elephant in the room is, 90% of ASICs were made by Bitmain. One single entity, can install a backdoor, with one flip of a switch, 90% of hash power are under their control.

Staking pools takes commission, anyone with 32 ETH will not be using pools. PoS you don't need to wait years to mine a block. Even 32 ETH minimum stakers can get reward fairly quickly. So instead of giant pools like PoW, medium pools alone with many small stakers is what we most likely gonna see. Much more decentralized than PoW.

I do realize the amount of work and funds that are spent. And I do know that it's much more than the results you get from it, because it's still a distributed network, however hard they work for it. It's necessarily sub-par to a decentralized network in terms of solution exploration and cost reductions. 

&gt;Sure, people don't care about the number of engineers, but it's not a coincidence that the companies with all those engineers offer more capable hardware and better services than people on Golem. As of right now Golem can't compete with any of those services, so clearly it doesn't work how you think.

You're again claiming they can't compete as if there was some centralized organization deciding what amount of service they'd deliver. It's not the case. It's a decentralized service. Its offer dynamically matches needs. 

It's literally just like miners dynamically matching demand for chain security. No one claims miners won't be able to provide more security whenever it's needed, because everyone knows there are way more than enough human beings world wide to provide the service nearly as soon as it's asked.

&gt;This assumes that all the AWS, Azures, a GCPs of the world are part of it. If they're not, then no, it doesn't work like that.

Nothing prevents AWS from being on Golem. If they don't, it only means that they can't compete because they can only thrive with customers paying way more.

&gt;Golem can't scale fast regardless of the demand because the providers can't afford to scale as fast. Why? Because John Doe and Joe's Render Farm can't afford to scale like the big companies. They also can't achieve the same cost efficiencies.

Go tell that to miners, then. Lol, we've got years and years of reality disproving your claims, but sure. We've got so much of it even politicians are talking worldwide about the phenomenon of miners and their costs.

&gt;And this illustrates a clear flaw in your thinking. Your hypothetical network requires Google and Amazon etc to join it.

Absolutely not. They can, but they're not needed at all.

If your intent is honest discussion, it's best to have full conviction before reaching for adversarial language.

If you don't have conviction about something, it's better to phrase your opinion as a question and see whether it leads your discussion partner into a contradiction or leads you toward a more correct understanding.

It doesn't really matter how I feel about it. I'm not here to make value judgments.

It does have unfavorable properties for transaction senders, though, and in practice it isn't as permissionless as it could be, so I encourage the work being done to minimize/democratize it.
