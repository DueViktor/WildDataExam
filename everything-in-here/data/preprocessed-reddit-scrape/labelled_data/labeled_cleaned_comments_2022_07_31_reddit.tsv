This is really an issue that requires special attention. But let's talk about it. Nowadays, on many web2 platforms, user behavior is restrained by the fear of being punished (e.g. getting banned), isn't it? But what could be the alternative? One such alternative is exactly what Solcial offers - taking care of your reputation! In other words, users' behavior can be regulated by their desire to be acknowledged by other users, because this acknowledgement can bring them profit in the direct sense of the word. But of course I admit that there will be those who just want to indulge or be harmful. I suppose the issue with such users can be solved by collective moderation, thanks to which bad content will simply be hidden.  
Anyway, only time will tell us how society is ready to use the social network without restrictions, but perhaps time will also show that society will start to become more mature because of this.

If you already have a stake account, it gets merged into the pool. Every so often, the pool rebalances the internal stake accounts in order to increase decentralization on Solana by spreading stake out across many validators.

As for staking rewards, the price of your pool token (mSOL, bSOL, etc.) will increase over time relative to staking rewards, so when you sell the token, you get more SOL back in return. That is because for every staked token, there's a staked SOL that's gaining staking rewards and increasing in value over time.

For example, BlazeStake ranks around 100th place out of around 2000 validators with an APY of around 5.5% (around 5.9% if you average across the past year, but APY has naturally decreased for everyone since then because of longer epochs), so I guess using BlazeStake gives you a higher APY than 95% of validators (although 5% of validators have a bit higher APY).

The reason stake pools can't be at the very top is that they spread stake across lots of validators, some which are higher in APY and some which are lower.

The fact that you don't mention that is a joke. You also need over 66% of stake to attack the network and even Beacon Chain will still have the same deterministic scheduling.

61	[]	False		gigabyteIO			[]				text	t2_gveaz	False	True	"Comparing Solana to Ethereum's early history is not a fair comparison. ETH never had any downtime in its entire history, unlike SOL. ETH is far from perfect but SOL's numerous red flags cannot be excused.

Starting with blatant fraud at the birth of this project:  
In early April 2020 the SOL team stated that the total circulating supply was 8.2M.  
When in reality the total circulating supply was above 20M! As questions &amp; critiques started to pile up over the following weeks, the official moderators kept insisting that there was no extra circulating supply as people grew more suspicious. Especially as SOL failed to update their Binance &amp; Coinmarketcap info.  
By the end of the month a 3rd party found a unlocked Solana wallet containing 13M tokens. Once the Solana team was fully exposed they released a medium article admitting to the fraud, explaining that these 13M tokens where loaned to a “marketmaker” while promising to get these coins back &amp; burn them within 30 days. On numerous occasions in the following weeks, the Solana team guaranteed that they would not release any new coins into the market without announcing it beforehand. Repeatedly they made this promise!  
On may 23rd the Solana team announced that they were only able to retrieve 3.3M coins out of the 11.3M they had loaned out. So instead they released 8M new SOL tokens into circulation in order meet their commitment to burn without any announcement beforehand! The total circulating supply was now 16M, double the supply promised in April!  
After this they just moved on, not even publishing this release on any of their own official announcement channels.  
This can all be verified!  
From Telegram to subtly reading between the lines of their own Medium article releases.

Now we will cover more of the lies:  
On the 15th of Sep 2021 the SOL network was brought down by a very high TX count u/Solana claimed the network was brought down by doing 400k TPS. This was a objectively false claim designed to make SOL look better then it really is. If TXs do not make it into the blockchain, you cannot claim that as the TPS limit. TXs in mempool (Gulf Stream) do not count towards TPS! TPS is a measure of network capacity, BTC can even handle higher loads on its mempool.

The reality is that SOL is not innovative at all! It is just the first major blockchain to be so reckless in their fundamental design, while pretending as if that is innovative! Most VC's just do not understand the engineering trade offs &amp; the inherent risks involved. 

Specifically Proof of History &amp; Turbine:  
A consequence of PoH is deterministic block creation. Before SOL almost all blockchains used non-deterministic block creation, as it adds to security &amp; censorship resistance as you cannot predict who will create the next block. Instead in SOL it is possible to predict &amp; therefore attack the next block producers inline. For instance attacking the next 100 validators inline instead of attacking the entire network. This attack also works regardless of scale, thereby severely reducing SOL security. SOL security is not just reduced against DDoS attacks since this attack can be combined with a 51% attack, as an attacker would not need 51% stake to carry out a 51% attack. Due to PoH an attacker could DDoS next stake holders inline &amp; thereby gain control over the network.

Combining Turbine with PoH leads to even more dire consequences:  
Turbine divides the transaction memory pool into small groupings of validators.  
This means that with PoH you can censor transactions by just attacking the specific validators in that grouping next inline!

The Sol team has consistently displayed a pattern of bad behavior.  
Prioritizing attracting ignorant investors over good blockchain design, SOL is likely purposefully tricking non-technical investors with technobabble."	0347286c8dcbec328987635bf4c948334c28414a	True	False					0	1659140345		0	{}	ii75a1h	False	t3_wa8kn6	False	True	t1_ii72t4v	/r/solana/comments/wa8kn6/is_solana_decentralized_and_stable/ii75a1h/	1659140359	1	False	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n	r/solana	public		0	[]		comparing solana to ethereum s early history is not a fair comparison eth never had any downtime in its entire history unlike sol eth is far from perfect but sol s numerous red flags cannot be excused starting with blatant fraud at the birth of this project in early april 2020 the sol team stated that the total circulating supply was 8 2m when in reality the total circulating supply was above 20m as questions amp critiques started to pile up over the following weeks the official moderators kept insisting that there was no extra circulating supply as people grew more suspicious especially as sol failed to update their binance amp coinmarketcap info by the end of the month a 3rd party found a unlocked solana wallet containing 13m tokens once the solana team was fully exposed they released a medium article admitting to the fraud explaining that these 13m tokens where loaned to a marketmaker while promising to get these coins back amp burn them within 30 days on numerous occasions in the following weeks the solana team guaranteed that they would not release any new coins into the market without announcing it beforehand repeatedly they made this promise on may 23rd the solana team announced that they were only able to retrieve 3 3m coins out of the 11 3m they had loaned out so instead they released 8m new sol tokens into circulation in order meet their commitment to burn without any announcement beforehand the total circulating supply was now 16m double the supply promised in april after this they just moved on not even publishing this release on any of their own official announcement channels this can all be verified from telegram to subtly reading between the lines of their own medium article releases links to all primary sources can be found here https web archive org web 20200701055655 https medium com coinmonks solanas snowball of lies entraps sol holders after a month long coin burn deception ce908dc0a398 https web archive org web 20200701055655 https medium com coinmonks solanas snowball of lies entraps sol holders after a month long coin burn deception ce908dc0a398 now we will cover more of the lies on the 15th of sep 2021 the sol network was brought down by a very high tx count u solana claimed the network was brought down by doing 400k tps this was a objectively false claim designed to make sol look better then it really is if txs do not make it into the blockchain you cannot claim that as the tps limit txs in mempool gulf stream do not count towards tps tps is a measure of network capacity btc can even handle higher loads on its mempool the reality is that sol is not innovative at all it is just the first major blockchain to be so reckless in their fundamental design while pretending as if that is innovative most vc s just do not understand the engineering trade offs amp the inherent risks involved specifically proof of history amp turbine a consequence of poh is deterministic block creation before sol almost all blockchains used non deterministic block creation as it adds to security amp censorship resistance as you cannot predict who will create the next block instead in sol it is possible to predict amp therefore attack the next block producers inline for instance attacking the next 100 validators inline instead of attacking the entire network this attack also works regardless of scale thereby severely reducing sol security sol security is not just reduced against ddos attacks since this attack can be combined with a 51 attack as an attacker would not need 51 stake to carry out a 51 attack due to poh an attacker could ddos next stake holders inline amp thereby gain control over the network combining turbine with poh leads to even more dire consequences turbine divides the transaction memory pool into small groupings of validators this means that with poh you can censor transactions by just attacking the specific validators in that grouping next inline the sol team has consistently displayed a pattern of bad behavior prioritizing attracting ignorant investors over good blockchain design sol is likely purposefully tricking non technical investors with technobabble 	0.002633247757330537	0.9880325794219971	0.8296666741371155	0.03507654368877411	0.993952214717865	0.4071711301803589	0.16210578382015228	8.453012014797423e-07	0.48782843351364136	0.0032611426431685686
