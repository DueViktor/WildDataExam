Unfortunately for the Cantillionaires, 90% of all bitcoin has already been mined, the majority of which is in the hands of individuals like you and I. The last 10% will take over 100 years to mine, the majority of which will wind up in the hands of individuals (yes individuals), companies, and governments that are all mining right now. The reason for this is simple: exponential deflation. The BTC inflation adjustment happens every 4 years (every 210k blocks) and is called the halving, where the coinbase (block reward) halves. It's currently 6.25 BTC per block. That means in 2024, it'll take 3-5 times the investment of what it costs currently, to make the same amount of BTC now, because of:

* halving
* average hashpower increase
* increasing informational scarcity per transaction
* the Lightning Network (although this could be offset with both volume and DLC's)

So the only way governments can acquire it more or less is the same way they acquired gold: confiscation schemes. That's why the clowns of Bitfinex hack fame who kept 2000 unencrypted seeds in the cloud are detrimental; it's why people that keep their coins on exchanges are fools; it's why anybody that trades bitcoin (especially with leverage) is a gambling junkie masquerading as an investor; it's why civil forfeiture and three-letter agencies are developing crypto-specific enforcement groups. This is how they plan on funding they're future surveillance and enforcement apparati. Governments can't print to acquire bitcoin anymore because that would moon the price of BTC and inadvertently put even more pressure on their central banks and require exponential printing; as BTC is the most free market and hard asset in mankind's 200k year history, it will margin call and suck the value of everything pegged to, or purchasable by it. So realistically, only one or two nation states could dump their gold on the open market for BTC before the price of gold cratered and is demonetized down to its utility value. Hedging to the downside wouldn't even work because gold derivative premiums would put a green candle through heaven's floorboards. Game theory would favor the first 1-2 movers (sellers) there, before irreparably damaging the 99% of the countries foolish enough to hold it."

I recently found an old [wallet.dat](https://wallet.data) file on one of my old harddrives from 2014. Pretty sure it won't have anything in it but just want to make sure I'm not missing something.

The thumbdrive had Bitcoin-Qt 0.8.5 on it as well so I opened it up, closed it, moved the wallet.dat file into appdata and then opened the app again. I grabbed the recieve address from the GUI and looked up the address in a blockchain explorer - shows nothing (bummer).

Is there any reason at this point to sync the whole chain at this point or does what I've done conclusively indicate the wallet is empty? Been a few years since I've done anything with crypto so just getting my head around the state of things.

""Bitcoin fixes this"" is a phrase that gets thrown around quite often. I will admit bitcoin does not fix everything neither does it intend to. What it does 'best' is why it is a solution to many issues. A decentralized immutable global monetary network secured by the consensus.

Recently we saw GoFundMe censor user's funds being sent to the cause of their choice! Over $8m of funds were withheld from being donated and now users are given until Feb 19th to request a refund. At first hand we are seeing centralized organizations censor user's funds. 

In retaliation to the censored funds, we saw protesters organize donations to be sent via Tallycoin app which is built on top of the bitcoin network. Donators had the ability to send satoshi's through an immutable network knowing first hand they will not be censored 

The Canadian Government's dystopian response to this was to freeze funds of all connected users for both currencies and digital assets. this kind of widespread censorship to tax-paying citizens is that of an authoritarian response, but don't forget, this could happen anywhere. 

[\(If you're not familiar, Referring to the authoritarian regime from \\""V For Vendetta\)](https://preview.redd.it/6s4libv4rpi81.png?width=726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=174640f93d56ac91811f29a25edbf52e95345df1)

Societies are highly complex in their structure but at the foundation of all societies are hard working individuals. One would assume individuals would be able to spend their money as they see fit, sadly this is not the case in the world we live in. Not in it's current state. 

Questions are now arising such as 

""What are true property rights?"" 

""How do we combat censorship?""

""Why can't they stop bitcoin transactions?"" 

""If I'm not in control who is?""

""What is money?"" 

These are the questions that eventually lead one to Bitcoin.

One of Bitcoin's most crucial utilities comes from it's design. It is truly decentralized which makes it both highly secure and highly immutable due to their not being a central authority to make all the decisions. These 'decisions' are engraved in code. 

These 'decisions' are written in code only to be executed when predefined conditions are met, this allows for full inclusivity to a global monetary network. This allows an honest network where users can stay fully anonymous, all due to trust guarantees not trust assumptions. 

I think it's about time people start waking up to the philosophical aspect of bitcoin which leads to quite a paradigm shift in thought. No longer are we forced to trust third parties, governments, and central banks. We now have an immutable global network at our disposal.

Bitcoin's total hashrate is 214 Exa Hash per second right now. That is 214\*10\^18 hash rate. [Source](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate).

As an example, an RTX 3090 has a hash rate of 121 Mega Hash per second. That is 121\*10\^6 hash rate.

So (214\*10\^18) / (121\*10\^6) = 1.76\*10\^12 or in other words: The equivalent of 1,760,000,000,000 RTX 3090s are mining Bitcoin right now.

This is why you had to be in bitcoin. The Ukrainian hryvnia will completely collapse to zero with an invasion. There is no other option for most people without international bank accounts unless you hold your wealth in physical \[foreign\] dollars or gold, both of which present huge risks if you have to move through blockades and borders.

Now the story...  
🪙  This year I started to learn about crypto (I know it's been out there for over a decade now, haha), and then I made some investments using the  Coinbase marketplace.

💡About a week ago I had the idea that I  could create a tiny website targeted at existing Coinbase users as well as potential new users to share or use Coinbase Referral Links (because both parties win at the end of the day - one of those win-win situations  🤝).

🚢 A week passed by, and the project has been launched! I'm definitely not a designer (I prob spent half of my time figuring out a UI), but I'm very happy with how it turned out 👌.

I’m struggling a bit to find the best method that will work for me. 

- Issue with the Ledger or any hardware wallets is that it becomes a single point of failure? If I lose it or it breaks or it goes through the dryer, I am shit-out-of-luck? If I really needed to, I could do this but it doesn’t seem like a convenient option. The code also isn’t open source, so I’m effectively trusting another 3rd party?

- paper wallets actually seem the easiest because I can be creative about where I save my private keys in various locations and have no reliance on a single piece of hardware. Issue is that there’s this weird need to generate a new address every time I spend less than my full balance? Weird, but if I just plan to save my BTC for many years, I could go this route

- Digital wallet like BlueWallet. Open source and I can hold custody of my coins and private keys. Downside is they could theoretically be hacked because it’s digital? Is this a real risk - I guess I’d be more worried about censorship than hackers of open source system.

If you head over to their subreddit Reddit you will see many people complaining that their Staked Solanium (SLIM) is being automatically restaked without them doing anything.

On top of that - after the lockup period, you will get something like the below (pending withdrawal) when you try to remove any of your staked tokens, with no ability to do anything else. Mine has been pending for 3 days.

Contacting their Telegram and questioning anything on there will get your removed instantly. They have no Discord and are completely anonymous. Reaching out to them via Twitter and online support will get you no response. I have tried several times as well as a few friends. Many people on the subreddit have suffered the same fate and lost their staked tokens.

Would appreciate anyone who has read this to give it an upvote for exposure. I don't expect my money back at this point, but I'm truly baffled as to why Solanium still functions as a reputable launchpad after basically taking stakers money that isn't theirs.

So the idea is about distributed insurance, let's say we have 3 roles the insured the insurer and the validator/approver. The insured creates insurance opportunities on the platform making them available for the insurers to find and make insurance offers. This could be anything like asking for a smartphone insurance plan. Multiple insurers would then evaluate the opportunity and make an offer, for example $9.99 every month. Then the insured would accept one of the offers. A smart contract would be established that governs the rules specified in the offer and the insurer would provide USDC as collateral. When there is a claim, a group of validators take a look at the proof and vote for the acceptance or refusal of the claim. The validators would receive a fee from the insured such that all the party member are rewarded. I would like to ask for your opinion, do you think that people would be willing to use such a platform?
