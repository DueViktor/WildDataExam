FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

143	[]	False		Silarous			[]				text	t2_12igg3	False	False	"&gt;Yes that‚Äôs because of inflation. The inflation forces them to invest in companies and take risks as opposed to sitting back and enjoying risk free deflation.

&gt;It‚Äôs much better for the economy that their money goes into the economy rather then sitting in their banks for example.


You're implying the common narrative that a little inflation is needed to keep people from sitting on their money to stimulate the economy.  People will always buy things when they need them or when they want them, regardless of what their price may be in the future.  Investors will also still exist regardless if their capital appreciates over time.  There will still be the desire to make MORE money buy purchasing assets that produce cash flow vs sticking all their money in the bank waiting for appreciation from deflation (that may not necessarily happen).  

No one should be forced to invest their money in risky investments just to try and protect their purchasing power.  That is the problem not the solution.  


&gt;Agreed! But you are missing one critical detail; the poor have debt. Their car, their house are big debts and they pay them off 2% yearly just because of inflation

Disagree.  Much of the poor have little to no debt due to bad credit history, no assets to provide as collateral, and low wages.  These are the people whom are stuck renting, living paycheck to paycheck just trying to make ends meet while the little wealth they have (their paycheck) is stolen from them via inflation.  Many of these people don't even realise the problem at hand and make little steps to try and protect themselves.  

Again, this cheap debt is a benefit that the rich enjoy.  Why liquidate assets that are producing for them when they can use them as collateral to buy more?
