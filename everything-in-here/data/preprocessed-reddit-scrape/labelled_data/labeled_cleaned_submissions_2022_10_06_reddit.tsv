I'm currently struggling to pay my rent and other general living expenses like food and transportation. I came to Japan with high hopes and dreams, but I've struggled to make ends meet since I ran out of money. My family does not financially support me, so I am entirely self-dependant on my part-time. I attempted to seek financial assistance in Japan but was informed that there is no program for international students. I have a part-time job (I'm not allowed to work full time due to restrictions), but as of now I don't have the money to get to work which takes about 1200 Yen round trip every day; hence I might get fired soon. I usually am very hesitant to ask for money, but I realized I have run out of options. With the $1500, I can buy food and pay for my transportation to work; with the money from my part-time, I can hopefully pay my rent. Please help me survive in Japan for this month at least. I'd be forever grateful for the help, and hopefully, I can help others in the future as well. EVEN $1 WOULD HELP! Thank you so much to anyone willing to help me out.

I had missed the 2017 pump and did not want to repeat the mistake. Toward the end of 2018, I purchased 20BTC for approximately $80k (approximately $3.9k per coin), which resulted in me burning through all of my savings. Then there was 2021. This year was a good one for me because my investment finally paid off. I sold all of my coins in the summer of 2021 for approximately $1.1 million. I didn't want to take the risk back then, and I was content with the profit I made. In July 2021, I repurchased Bitcoin with all of my profits, resulting in approximately 31.8BTC, which I sold for $1.96M near the end of 2021. I've only taken out about 460k since then, with the remaining $1.5M still in my crypto wallet, waiting for the right opportunity to invest. Since then, I've done a lot of research, reached out to old friends who are completely into crypto and have built a livelihood around it and have finally come up with a strategy. I was considering investing a portion of my profit in Hosted Bitcoin Mining (due to the high returns) and the remainder in bitcoin and other altcoins. What are your thoughts on my strategy? Do you think I should prioritize one over the other? If you have any coins/tokens in mind, please mention them as well as why they would be a good investment. Thank you in advance.

**Why Bitcoin’s Energy Consumption Is An Optimised Design By Nature**

Bitcoin’s energy consumption has been widely criticised. People claim that it is an outdated feature and newer, more modern blockchains have overcome that problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin is open source. It’s decentralized. It’s free market. It trades globally 24/7. It’s permissionless. Its distribution is fixed and predictable. It’s pseudonymous. Verifiable. It’s impairment resistant. It’s a store of value, a currency, and a central bank, in one singularity. It’s full-stack is sophisticated, impossibly simple, beautiful. We can thank the 20 years of work from the cypherpunks that gave us encryption.

One of the major tenants the well read maxi's preach is that as money is separated from State, the political class gets demonetized globally. This means their ability to make war is over. The military industrial complexes collapse, and all the energy, money, and resources spent there can get redistributed. This is bitcoin's vision of wealth redistribution. The hope is borders fall a bit, and tax levies are impaired enough that only projects of value with transparent accounting get the cut. The hope is because BTC has a habit of appreciating in value, consumer's time preferences get longer, and gone is the mindless nonsense consumerism, and this combined with deflationary pressure of the asset, not only keeps consumer prices equitable, buy allows someone working even a menial job the ability to store their work energy in an asset that won't depreciate.

So as the internet, blockchains, remote work, and the proliferation of English compose, the centers of power start getting distributed away. It's no longer a world that can even house dictators, or finance surveillance states or afford large scale corruption anymore. Lots of power gets returned to the people and maybe here we unlock our collective value.

I'm of the belief as well, that bitcoin lengthens people's time preferences, and does away with their mindless consumerism. Saving money, and having that money maintain its value from 1-5 years or even appreciate, will completely change people's minds and discipline. It's the mindless consumerism which has destroyed the environment and leads to climate change. Nobody will admit that though? It's the mad inflating dollars promoting this. Gov't has to give away dollars in Student Loan Forgiveness, how else can our young adults have a good time? They are lost in the black stuck hole of fiscal irresponsibility. Growth, growth, growth, how else can you outpace inflation? Spend that shit the moment you get it or start losing the moment you don't. 

This is a crucially overlooked aspect of bitcoin. And since we run on 4-year election cycles, where the hell are you going to find the political capital to do the right thing and say party is over, we can't promote this growth and have a planet too. I can't keep spending trillions for my legacy and hand the bag off for the next President to do the same thing 

Lastly, bitcoin mining is what will promote green energy to reduce its own liability, and capture energy waste. But mainstream talking points move in 24 hour cycles and innovation takes longer than that type of patience.

i'm starting to think this spooky non linear regression based on the mandelbrot set and the bifurcation diagram can be used to predict the bitcoin peaks and bottoms. 

I did this research or **Due Diligence** (DD) on the future behaviour of BTC.

What's your opionion on this?

I hope the resolution is high enough for you to be able to read everything.

With the anticipation of recession, more investors are opting to add bitcoin to their investment portfolios than gold today. However, [CNN's article](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/01/perspectives/cryptocurrency-government-regulation/index.html.) by Parker reports that the currency plunged more than 70% from its all-time peak the year before. Additionally, Forbes magazine highlights that [Bitcoin rose to approximately $20,000 in late 2017 before plummeting to around $3,000 a year later](https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2020/08/11/move-over-facebook-apple-google-and-amazon-bitcoin-is-suddenly-behaving-like-a-tech-stock/?sh=6bcc83ae6534.). Bitcoins fluctuation makes it an unfavourable investment decision compared to gold. Gold investments are more stable as they have cross-functional utility and are appropriately regulated in all countries. Therefore, gold investments are more suitable than bitcoin investments for investors.

The city is quickly becoming a hotspot for crypto acceptance in Western Europe.  


A local media outlet posted a one-minute video on Twitter (October 3) of ordering meals at a McDonald's digital kiosk and then paying for it at the regular register using a smartphone app. The Tether (USDT) logo was noticed next to the Bitcoin sign on the credit cash machine, which is not surprising given that the city of Lugano stated in March 2022 that it will accept Bitcoin, Tether, and the LVGA token as legal tender.

On March 3, 2022, the city signed an MoU with Tether Operations Limited, initiating the so-called ""Plan B."" Tether has established two funds, the first of which is a $106 million, or 100 million Swiss francs, investment pool for crypto entrepreneurs. The second one is roughly $3 million, or 3 million Swiss francs, attempting to stimulate the use of crypto for shops and enterprises around the city.

In addition to allowing Lugano residents to pay their taxes using **cryptocurrency**, the initiative will also accept payments for parking fines, public services, and student tuition expenses. More than 200 local stores and companies are also anticipated to accept cryptocurrency payments for products and services.

Speaking to sources in June, Paolo Ardoino, chief technical officer of Tether and Bitfinex, stated in June that Plan B is ""doing wonderfully,"" promising a two-week educational event on blockchain and cryptocurrencies in the city.

In September 2021, El Salvador became the first country in the world to accept **Bitcoin as a legal tender**.

The US debt is massive, they're not going to pay for it with tax cuts, they are going to pay for it with printing. If you hold fiat, if you have contracts that promise to pay you later in fiat (e.g. bonds) then you will pay for that debt in proportion to that fiat exposure. It will be intentionally, by design, not clear the exact moments when that inflation takes place (e.g. when the printing happens, when financial assets show price increase, when land shows price increase, when bread does). If everyone knew exactly when fiat loses it's value, they'd dodge those losses. 

You can debate the morality of who racked up that debt, who should pay for it, what all that money bought, etc. But the facts are that you will pay it off and more in proportion to your fiat exposure and it will be hard to predict. Bitcoin isn't a good asset to speculate on and jump back to the 'safety' of fiat. Fiat is a ship guaranteed to sink, it just sinks slow since it's so big. Bitcoin is a non-sinking ship.

In furtherance of this scheme his company just published code for directing the seizure of third party coins in the BSV blockchain.  BSV is a scammy bitcoin knockoff that is proprietary software controlled exclusive by Wright and his agents. Users of BSV are only permitted to run the software he approves so they're able to foist their coin stealing code onto their users which would be impossible for legitimate cryptocurrencies.

Because of this I believe any user of the BSV altcoin is in serious risk of exposure to network consensus instability or outright having their assets frozen or stolen out from under them.

This would be of no direct relevance to Bitcoin users except some Bitcoin exchanges support BSV and so far whenever an exchange has gone insolvent they've pooled assets from all users in the bankruptcy.   This means that if an exchange becomes insolvent due to Wright stealing or freezing BSV out from under it users Bitcoin balances may be used to make BSV customers whole.

While it's never a good idea to leave Bitcoins you aren't actively trading on exchange I'd strongly recommend getting your funds off the following exchanges ASAP (non-exhaustive list):

* Robinhood
* Bitfinex
* Bittrex
* Hitbtc
* Huobi Global
* Kucoin
* Bithumb
* Gate.io
* Poloniex
* CoinW
* Indoex
* OKX
* CoinDCX
* Pionex
* Upbit
* Bibox
* Bkex
* Yobit
* Deepcoin
* Mexo Exchange
* Wazirx
* CoinEx

Of course, since the BSV ecosystem has been engaging in non-stop harassment of Bitcoiners including multibillion dollar lawsuits against Bitcoin developers and non-BSV supporting exchanges it's probably prudent to not to business with exchanges still supporting this ecosystem to begin with, if you care about the vale of your Bitcoins'.

I'd expect that I'd have to transfer my ERC-20 token to the L1 bridge contract address (let's call it 0xAAA).   


Probably, there's some relayer watching for ""Transfer"" events that are targeted to 0xAAA, so it knows something relevant happened. It waits until this txn is final in L1 just to be sure.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this relayer would send a tx to the L2 bridge contract to confirm that this ERC-20 is fine to be created in the L2; and here is where my questions appear:  
Q1) Can the L2 bridge contract do some extra verification that the relayer isn't lying? Unless the L2 bridge has a way of knowing the TxnReceipt root and accepts a Merkle Proof of the relayer, then I don't think it's possible?  
Q2) How is this ERC-20 in L2 created? The underlying smart-contract of the ERC-20 in L1 might not exist in L1. How are these ERC-20 in L2 represented? Maybe the relayer also deployed the underlying smart-contract bytecode?

#                                                  The Story📜

[2016 - 2020](https://preview.redd.it/5qh5bhdt2yr91.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f02ca23597ca9e8ae4707844fbf50fc0378dc662)

&gt;The beginning of the work of the closed town “Arkham”, quickly and confidently, the best specialists of DPOIPAC worked to create a virus for the benefit of the state. This was the reason for the increased repression in 2017 against the “Keriks” group (criminals and mentally ill people). In the two years of 2016–2018, about 30,000 people were brought into Arkham without trial or investigation, of which about 28,000 were killed in the same time period, more were shot due to unsuitability. In just 4 years of work, about 50,000 “Keriks” became prisoners of “Arkham”. After the creation of the Kerik-1 virus (2018), research did not stop, but the number of victims decreased by 13,000 (2018–2020). For 4 years of operation of the enterprise, scientists have achieved great achievements in science and medicine.

**2020 - 2032**

&gt;During World War 3, the Arkham enterprise was released from DPOIPAC (2020), and transferred to the authority of the new Dreambayd state (2021). During the year, the Dreambayd authorities, under the supervision of AOFN, decided what to do with Arkham, but due to the pandemic (2022–2032) they decided to mothball the project until better times. Due to unsuitability, having exterminated 8659 Arkham prisoners and 390 camp workers, the Dreambayd authorities left only 3951 people and classified the find (2022). During the isolation of Arkham, the enterprise did not suffer any special changes, the guards also mocked the prisoners and increased their authority, the prisoners themselves did not rebel, but were grateful for the abolition of the death penalty in Arkham. In general, in the period from 2022 to 2032, a lot has changed, despite the global pandemic, Arkham was very well supplied with food and medicine, new televisions, radios, and other things, although this all did not fall into the hands of the prisoners because of the guards. In general, it is worth saying that at first the prisoners were not even notified about the isolation of Arkham, but over 4 years even the prisoners became aware of the situation. The prisoners did not accept the rebellion attempt, and it was difficult to do it while sitting in a 2 by 2 meter cell. After 6 years of being in isolation, Arkham lost about 10–20 guards and 100–150 prisoners, but this information is approximate, since no one kept a census. After 7 years, despite the fact that Arkham and all the people in it were isolated, they still got a way to communicate with the outside world, but only some representatives of the general table had such an opportunity. Between 2028 and 2031, cases began to occur inside Arkham. Diseases of the unexpectedly spreading pathogen kerik-1, in most cases, did not lead to deaths (about 300 victims) or serious consequences, but what happened in 2032 could not bypass anyone !!!

**2032**

&gt;The year 2032 was a turning point, it was in this year that a prisoner from cell 32 once again fell ill with a mutated version of kerik-1, but no one paid due attention to this, since everyone who lived in Arkham had been ill with different mutations of this virus 1–2 times, and all the Arkham medics did was ban all contact with the prisoner for 2 weeks. It was a fatal mistake, because the mutations that occurred with the virus inside this prisoner became completely new and never seen before in science. It is not known what happened to this prisoner, but after his quarantine period ended, and they began to contact him, a new outbreak of the virus began, which was called (Kerik2032), which covered the entire Arkham in a month! Only during this month, scientists concluded that this virus was incurable, after which the entire staff of scientists had been ill with this virus, which made them psychokerics, not scientists! As a result, all the people who lived in Arkham turned into PsychoKeriks!

#                                                  ROADMAP 1.0📍

* **PsychoKeriks PROLOG Collection (SOL);**
* **Secret Airdrop HOLDERS;**
* **PsychoKeriks ORIGINAL Collection (ETH);**
* **SOCIAL NETWORK for the NFT's segment.**

**The first stage of our project is related to the development and acceptance of a strong audience into our project on Solana Blockchain.**

&gt;Our goal is to build buzz around the project and get a stronger footing in the industry, including creating a community of like-minded people.   
&gt;  
&gt;We chose this direction understanding the highly developed level of the network and the ability to write all the possible contracts that will be required for our start-up and in the future environment.

**Integrating our community into a new network and creating a community there.**

&gt;We are well aware that these are SOL and ETH, the two most promising development markets. And we want to unite them and show a bullish level in all the environments available to us.  
&gt;  
&gt;It will also give a necessary boost to the promotion of our social network. When a collection does not stand still and has a successful project behind it, it gives a high level of support among the audience.  
&gt;  
&gt;We are not going to leave out the members of our SOL community. Throughout all phases of the project we will support them. First of all with Staking and active sharing, both for real prizes and bonuses within our social network. Secondly, every holder of our NFT on SOL will be able to exchange their coins for free access to minting in the ETH network.

**To attract new people to this structure and to successfully show that we are something big.**

&gt;That we are all something more than just pictures and everyone can develop their own brand. Our face and our profile.  
&gt;  
&gt;We want to offer a substitution for social networks which you can see now and make a separate ecosystem, expanding functionality for project creators and Web 3.0 participants.  
&gt;  
&gt;In our project and development path we will be ready to take everyone from the bottom to the top of our project. Even if you have the lowest level of knowledge in Web 3.0 we will support you and give you the necessary level. And we will not stop on this.

#                                                  The Story📜

[2016 - 2020](https://preview.redd.it/5qh5bhdt2yr91.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f02ca23597ca9e8ae4707844fbf50fc0378dc662)

&gt;The beginning of the work of the closed town “Arkham”, quickly and confidently, the best specialists of DPOIPAC worked to create a virus for the benefit of the state. This was the reason for the increased repression in 2017 against the “Keriks” group (criminals and mentally ill people). In the two years of 2016–2018, about 30,000 people were brought into Arkham without trial or investigation, of which about 28,000 were killed in the same time period, more were shot due to unsuitability. In just 4 years of work, about 50,000 “Keriks” became prisoners of “Arkham”. After the creation of the Kerik-1 virus (2018), research did not stop, but the number of victims decreased by 13,000 (2018–2020). For 4 years of operation of the enterprise, scientists have achieved great achievements in science and medicine.

**2020 - 2032**

&gt;During World War 3, the Arkham enterprise was released from DPOIPAC (2020), and transferred to the authority of the new Dreambayd state (2021). During the year, the Dreambayd authorities, under the supervision of AOFN, decided what to do with Arkham, but due to the pandemic (2022–2032) they decided to mothball the project until better times. Due to unsuitability, having exterminated 8659 Arkham prisoners and 390 camp workers, the Dreambayd authorities left only 3951 people and classified the find (2022). During the isolation of Arkham, the enterprise did not suffer any special changes, the guards also mocked the prisoners and increased their authority, the prisoners themselves did not rebel, but were grateful for the abolition of the death penalty in Arkham. In general, in the period from 2022 to 2032, a lot has changed, despite the global pandemic, Arkham was very well supplied with food and medicine, new televisions, radios, and other things, although this all did not fall into the hands of the prisoners because of the guards. In general, it is worth saying that at first the prisoners were not even notified about the isolation of Arkham, but over 4 years even the prisoners became aware of the situation. The prisoners did not accept the rebellion attempt, and it was difficult to do it while sitting in a 2 by 2 meter cell. After 6 years of being in isolation, Arkham lost about 10–20 guards and 100–150 prisoners, but this information is approximate, since no one kept a census. After 7 years, despite the fact that Arkham and all the people in it were isolated, they still got a way to communicate with the outside world, but only some representatives of the general table had such an opportunity. Between 2028 and 2031, cases began to occur inside Arkham. Diseases of the unexpectedly spreading pathogen kerik-1, in most cases, did not lead to deaths (about 300 victims) or serious consequences, but what happened in 2032 could not bypass anyone !!!

**2032**

&gt;The year 2032 was a turning point, it was in this year that a prisoner from cell 32 once again fell ill with a mutated version of kerik-1, but no one paid due attention to this, since everyone who lived in Arkham had been ill with different mutations of this virus 1–2 times, and all the Arkham medics did was ban all contact with the prisoner for 2 weeks. It was a fatal mistake, because the mutations that occurred with the virus inside this prisoner became completely new and never seen before in science. It is not known what happened to this prisoner, but after his quarantine period ended, and they began to contact him, a new outbreak of the virus began, which was called (Kerik2032), which covered the entire Arkham in a month! Only during this month, scientists concluded that this virus was incurable, after which the entire staff of scientists had been ill with this virus, which made them psychokerics, not scientists! As a result, all the people who lived in Arkham turned into PsychoKeriks!

* **PsychoKeriks PROLOG Collection (SOL);**
* **Secret Airdrop HOLDERS;**
* **PsychoKeriks ORIGINAL Collection (ETH);**
* **SOCIAL NETWORK for the NFT's segment.**

**The first stage of our project is related to the development and acceptance of a strong audience into our project on Solana Blockchain.**

&gt;Our goal is to build buzz around the project and get a stronger footing in the industry, including creating a community of like-minded people.   
&gt;  
&gt;We chose this direction understanding the highly developed level of the network and the ability to write all the possible contracts that will be required for our start-up and in the future environment.

**Integrating our community into a new network and creating a community there.**

&gt;We are well aware that these are SOL and ETH, the two most promising development markets. And we want to unite them and show a bullish level in all the environments available to us.  
&gt;  
&gt;It will also give a necessary boost to the promotion of our social network. When a collection does not stand still and has a successful project behind it, it gives a high level of support among the audience.  
&gt;  
&gt;We are not going to leave out the members of our SOL community. Throughout all phases of the project we will support them. First of all with Staking and active sharing, both for real prizes and bonuses within our social network. Secondly, every holder of our NFT on SOL will be able to exchange their coins for free access to minting in the ETH network.

**To attract new people to this structure and to successfully show that we are something big.**

&gt;That we are all something more than just pictures and everyone can develop their own brand. Our face and our profile.  
&gt;  
&gt;We want to offer a substitution for social networks which you can see now and make a separate ecosystem, expanding functionality for project creators and Web 3.0 participants.  
&gt;  
&gt;In our project and development path we will be ready to take everyone from the bottom to the top of our project. Even if you have the lowest level of knowledge in Web 3.0 we will support you and give you the necessary level. And we will not stop on this.

A couple of weeks ago I was asking about how one might verify that a program on chain really did come from the code that the developer claims (i.e. a particular git repo etc).  I got some responses back in the form of the anchor verified builds, but from what I could tell this requires the developer use anchor (i don't currently..).  


I decided to try to throw together my own program for verifying solana programs, which you can find at [https://www.daoplays.org/verified](https://www.daoplays.org/verified).    


A developer can put in the address of the program (on test/dev/main net) along with the build environment (rust/solana/anchor versions, blank if not used), and the location of the code (a git repo, or a compressed archive accessible via wget), and the backend will create a docker with the requested specs, get the code, deploy it, compare it to the program data on chain, and then set the verified state on that programs data account:  


1 = verification failed  
2 = verification succeeded but program is mutable so may be updated  
3 = verification succeeded and program is immutable  


the data account for that program stores the code location, git hash (if it was a git repo) or a hash of the archive file, and the verification state so that anyone can easily check the verification status of a program (eg an explorer).  As an example you can enter CNd6wN4en9Xvbf2e1ubb2YyCkC7J1BbbuhAGhqcdHFbi (the address of the verification program) and hit check status to see :  


Program verified and immutable!  
[https://github.com/daoplays/sol\_verify/archive/refs/heads/main.zip](https://github.com/daoplays/sol_verify/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)  
fc01d2dd3cf09a3655d705cd30cbd1afb5bdf018169204a89f31e78360aba267  
sol\_verify-main/program  


where the last entry is the sub directory of the archive that contains the code.  


It supports rust (with/without anchor) and C/C++ programs.. though the latter is only tested with the hello world example from Solana, and in principle can easily support any other frameworks/languages in the future.  


At the moment the backend is running on a free level azure VM, so it takes about 15-20minutes to complete a verification, though youll get status updates as it progresses.  Most of that time comes from docker downloading/building things that it builds every time.. so probably that is just me not knowing how to best use docker (i dont).  


I dont really know how useful anyone else will find this, i'll be writing up how it works as a blog post and will post on our twitter account [https://twitter.com/dao\_plays](https://twitter.com/dao_plays) if you are interested.

A couple of weeks ago I was asking about how one might verify that a program on chain really did come from the code that the developer claims (i.e. a particular git repo etc).  I got some responses back in the form of the anchor verified builds, but from what I could tell this requires the developer use anchor (i don't currently..).  


I decided to try to throw together my own program for verifying solana programs, which you can find at [https://www.daoplays.org/verified](https://www.daoplays.org/verified).    


A developer can put in the address of the program (on test/dev/main net) along with the build environment (rust/solana/anchor versions, blank if not used), and the location of the code (a git repo, or a compressed archive accessible via wget), and the backend will create a docker with the requested specs, get the code, deploy it, compare it to the program data on chain, and then set the verified state on that programs data account:  


1 = verification failed  
2 = verification succeeded but program is mutable so may be updated  
3 = verification succeeded and program is immutable  


the data account for that program stores the code location, git hash (if it was a git repo) or a hash of the archive file, and the verification state so that anyone can easily check the verification status of a program (eg an explorer).  As an example you can enter CNd6wN4en9Xvbf2e1ubb2YyCkC7J1BbbuhAGhqcdHFbi (the address of the verification program) and hit check status to see :  


Program verified and immutable!  
[https://github.com/daoplays/sol\_verify/archive/refs/heads/main.zip](https://github.com/daoplays/sol_verify/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)  
fc01d2dd3cf09a3655d705cd30cbd1afb5bdf018169204a89f31e78360aba267  
sol\_verify-main/program  


where the last entry is the sub directory of the archive that contains the code.  


It supports rust (with/without anchor) and C/C++ programs.. though the latter is only tested with the hello world example from Solana, and in principle can easily support any other frameworks/languages in the future.  


At the moment the backend is running on a free level azure VM, so it takes about 15-20minutes to complete a verification, though youll get status updates as it progresses.  Most of that time comes from docker downloading/building things that it builds every time.. so probably that is just me not knowing how to best use docker (i dont).  


I dont really know how useful anyone else will find this, i'll be writing up how it works as a blog post and will post on our twitter account [https://twitter.com/dao\_plays](https://twitter.com/dao_plays) if you are interested.
