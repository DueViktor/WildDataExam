19	[]		black_diamonds2			[]				text	t2_qk5o9zf	False	False	[]	"1. Someone should own bitcoin if they want to purchase something/send money to someone else and they can’t or don’t want to via traditional methods like wire transfer. This can be for a lot of reasons like sending money to relatives in a different country.

2. Vendors do not need to accept bitcoin for the network to operate, and if you want to pay them for their product using bitcoin you can always convert your bitcoin into a gift card and buy it that way. Vendor acceptance doesn’t have anything to do with network decentralization, the distributed part is referring to the technical side of how bitcoin itself is unstoppable, not on who is accepting it.

3. It absolutely would inflate the usd price of bitcoin, but you can send fractions of a bitcoin, so you can still send money to whoever you want regardless of the USD evaluation. 

4. An open market will determine the price, and basic math can give you the price of any fraction of bitcoin at any given price point.

5. The goal of bitcoin is well documented in the bitcoin white paper, but to sum it up the goal is to provide a digital cash system that allows anyone in the world to send money whenever they want. This digital cash doesn’t rely on any authority granting you the right to send money, and it has no biases or corruptions. It’s a fair game.

6. No one here knows, many think he’s dead. Maybe he thinks it’s best that bitcoin doesn’t have a human face to it. Maybe satoshi has moved on from bitcoin to something else he finds more worth while whether it be another cryptocurrency, or anything really.

7. This explanation could go on forever and requires a pretty complex understanding of computers, the internet, and cryptography. All you really need to know is that the smartest people in the world right now can’t hack it, and if you want to learn more research it yourself because like I said, the explanation goes on forever. 

8. It is corruption, and it happens every day. The problem however isn’t a problem that pertains to bitcoin only. If you hold cash and you get mugged it’s not the cash’s fault, it’s yours and the person who stole it. However I believe with bitcoin(especially when it’s portrayed as a store of value which I don’t believe) the stakes are dangerously higher than they ever have been before. Once a transaction is made it can not be reversed.
