There's no argument, it's a simple fact. Various materials come and go, nations rise and fall. The only currency that holds sway is land. It has been that way since the dawn of civilization and it doesn't look like it will change any time soon.

&gt; it‚Äôs not perfectly scarce as more land is always being developed, it‚Äôs got expensive upkeep, it‚Äôs entirely non-portable, it‚Äôs non-divisible.

I think you're having a different discussion, one where the merits of investment in a particular source of value are weighed. That's a fine discussion, but not the one I was addressing. Real estate is, as the above commenter said, ""the number one store of value."" No car, no metal, no collection of bits compares to land in terms of its store of value. Even the value we place in something like gold is mediated by land. It's the mines that are the source of that value, and that land can be bought or sold.

This is the difference. Every generation has been screwed and lied to by the 0.01% richest.  Every generation has fought like hell to survive and build a tiny nest egg before requirement... until Gen Z.

&gt; Micah Zoltu: ""Many people are shooting for Shanghai,""

means the goal is to get withdrawals in for Shanghai.

&gt; Micah: ""...the core devs haven‚Äôt yet discussed what will actually be included‚Ä¶""

This is referring to the situation I explained above. Maybe you're unfamiliar with Ethereum development cycles, but generally after an update/fork has wrapped up successfully and any necessary analysis is complete, the devs will begin to discuss which EIPs to target for inclusion in the next fork. Eventually they'll put together a formal list of EIPs which goes through some revisions and eventually gets finalized. Dev work then proceeds to get the EIPs implemented and tested, and once they're closing in on being ready, a fork date will be set.

As of a month ago when the article was posted, there had not been a formal list of Shanghai EIPs drafted. The core devs hadn't met to discuss that yet. As I mentioned, Maurius had put together an informal list--**which does include withdrawals**--but that's all we have so far. If, based on that, your interpretation is that withdrawals are not going to be included in Shanghai, then that same logic would mean that *no EIPs* are going to make it into Shanghai.

----

My final paragraph in the previous post is pretty much the current state of things, to answer your question. Withdrawals are present on the most official EIP list we have and we know dev work is underway. There would have been an All Core Devs meeting last Thursday, in which they probably would have started talking about Shanghai EIPs. But it was canceled since everyone is at Devcon anyway. Next ACD call should be on October 27th. I would highly encourage you to listen in: they should be starting to talk Shanghai and I think you'll be surprised at how transparent the process is."	ba9586c2c177fb35b642700a1386adcd6199028d	True	False					0	1665891854		0	{}	isi30ev	False	t3_y52poo	False	True	t1_ishz6th	/r/ethereum/comments/y52poo/ethereum_developer_confirms_shanghai_upgrade_will/isi30ev/	1665891870	1	False	True	False	ethereum	t5_2zf9m	r/ethereum	public		0	[]		[]	text	t2_ib0b	False	False	that is not what i mean and it s hard for me to understand how you could come to that conclusion gt micah zoltu many people are shooting for shanghai means the goal is to get withdrawals in for shanghai gt micah the core devs haven t yet discussed what will actually be included this is referring to the situation i explained above maybe you re unfamiliar with ethereum development cycles but generally after an update fork has wrapped up successfully and any necessary analysis is complete the devs will begin to discuss which eips to target for inclusion in the next fork eventually they ll put together a formal list of eips which goes through some revisions and eventually gets finalized dev work then proceeds to get the eips implemented and tested and once they re closing in on being ready a fork date will be set as of a month ago when the article was posted there had not been a formal list of shanghai eips drafted the core devs hadn t met to discuss that yet as i mentioned maurius had put together an informal list which does include withdrawals but that s all we have so far if based on that your interpretation is that withdrawals are not going to be included in shanghai then that same logic would mean that no eips are going to make it into shanghai my final paragraph in the previous post is pretty much the current state of things to answer your question withdrawals are present on the most official eip list we have and we know dev work is underway there would have been an all core devs meeting last thursday in which they probably would have started talking about shanghai eips but it was canceled since everyone is at devcon anyway next acd call should be on october 27th i would highly encourage you to listen in they should be starting to talk shanghai and i think you ll be surprised at how transparent the process is 	0.003169770585373044	0.9880621433258057	0.2989690899848938	0.028211114928126335	0.008812624961137772	0.2646310329437256	0.0638744905591011	8.509192639394314e-07	0.22737106680870056	0.01725873537361622

236	[]	False		austonst						"I've seen this article before; it's about 4 weeks old. Not sure why it's being posted here again now, makes me kind of skeptical about whether this was posted in good faith. In the first place, it's a terrible piece of reporting. Here's the main excerpt:

&gt; Zoltu told CryptoSlate that there is no agreed-upon timeline for withdrawals to be activated at present.

&gt; ‚ÄúMany people are shooting for Shanghai, but the core devs haven‚Äôt yet discussed what will actually be included‚Ä¶‚Äù

&gt; With that, the dev confirmed that the Ethereum website is incorrect, explaining the hick-up as a consequence of ‚Äúeverything being decentralized.‚Äù

This is a *clear misinterpretation* of what Micah was saying. The article was posted September 20th, right after the merge. Developers had just finished the Bellatrix+Paris forks, and they had simply not yet sat down together to discuss exactly what EIPs would be considered for Shanghai. So while everyone is on board for trying to get withdrawals into Shanghai, there hadn't even been an agreed-upon list of Shanghai EIPs yet.

If you find the [original source](https://cryptoslate.com/ethereum-developer-confirms-shanghai-upgrade-will-not-unlock-staked-tokens/), you will see it was edited to make a correction, which they posted in [another article](https://cryptoslate.com/developer-consensus-supports-ethereum-withdrawals-in-upcoming-shanghai-upgrade/). In the followup, they explain the same clarification I made above.

----

Since then (well, actually slightly before they article was posted, so shame on the writer for missing it), there has been a rough draft of a [Shanghai tracking issue on the geth github](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/25820). This list *does* contain an EIP for beacon chain withdrawals: [EIP-4895](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4895). Maurius van der Wijden has continued working on specs for withdrawals, with an [update as recently as yesterday](https://twitter.com/vdWijden/status/1580948992581861376).

275	[]	False		thomas_m_k						"Well, when there was the Ethereum Classic split in 2016, all transactions were replayed (I don't think we ever found out why). Which means that whenever you made some transaction on ETH, the same transaction was happening on ETC as well, *if* it was possible. So, under those circumstances, if you transfer your ETH to a new address, the ETC would be transferred to the corresponding address on the ETC chain. So, nothing was gained by this; your ETH and ETC are still both at the same address (though a different address from before). You didn't lose anything from this, because your private key from the ETH chain will also work on the ETC chain, but you also didn't gain anything.


So, how is it possible at all to split up your ETH and ETC so that they are in different addresses? You have to make a transaction that can only succeed on the ETH chain but not on the ETC chain. That's not easy to do, but it's possible by interacting with The DAO contract that was the original reason for the split into ETH and ETC. Due to the hardfork of ETH, the contract was in a different state to the one on the ETC chain. And with this, it was possible to split your coins.

I like Mark Zuckerberg's enthusiasm for the improved efficiency possibilities that come from virtual reality.

I'm assuming that as a last ditch attempt to save his platform, he will continue to remove barriers as meta platforms is forced to realize that you can't own the virtual reality. I will still be very interested to see what they do with facebook &amp; instagram.

I believe that they will do quite well regardless of the negativity because of the insane amount of information they have. I know people hate this tracking but the government uses it to catch the bad guys. It's all connected and the governments love instagram and facebook for very good purposes. As we know based off of the recent guy who went around killing people while livestreaming it to facebook, it's clear that no one is really paying attention to everything you do like a creep. It's sold though. That's the sad part. You're tracked everywhere. But now you're tracked in 3D. They can see everything you do with a virtual reality headset to mimic what you see. Your room at minimum will be mapped. Lots of new information to give off.
