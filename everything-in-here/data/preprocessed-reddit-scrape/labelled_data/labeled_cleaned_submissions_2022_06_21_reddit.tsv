There are explicit taxes that impact me and my earning potential such as income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes, state and local taxes. There are also implicit taxes that affect me in ways that are a bit more difficult to quantify like inflation (an invisible tax that diminishes the purchasing power for the dollars I keep) and corporate taxes (revenue that could have all or in part gone into employee salaries). 

Months prior I listened to a podcast with Robert Breedlove where he discussed the idea that one’s effective tax rate is a representation of how much a slave one is to the state. A statement I felt was bold, but the argument was interesting: what is slavery if not a 100% tax on your time and energy? 

I decided to take the challenge and determine how much a ""slave"" I really am. I reviewed my paycheck, my property tax bill, my monthly purchases and my state tax rate. The result surprised me to say the least. 

Here are the numbers represented as a percentage of my gross income: 

* Federal Income Tax: 26.16% 
* State Income Tax: 10.66% 
* Medicare Tax: 2.16% 
* Disability Tax: 1.64% 
* Social Security Tax: 9.25% 
* Property Tax: 4.94% 
* Monthly Expense Sales Tax (@ 7.75% rate): 2.71% 
* **Total Tax: 57.52%** 

And that’s just explicit taxes. The latest Consumer Price Inflation print for June 2022 was 8.6%. Simply adding the CPI figure into the sum puts me at a 66.12% total tax rate. 

For every 3 hours of work, the value created by 2 is taken from me and given to the government.

But a lot of new entrants get worried over investing and even panic sell to ""save"" their losses. 

Thankfully with some right knowledge, it is quite possible to convince them not to give in to the price fall and actually use this opportunity to buy. Sharing some pointers here:

**Historical data:** 

One of the best ways to assess bitcoin's performance is to look at its historical data.  Looking at the logarithmic regression of the bitcoin price *\[also known as the rainbow chart\]*, which takes the historical data of bitcoin price and charts the future trajectory of its price movement, shows a clear **upward trend** in the coming years.

**Adoption:**

Another great indicator of any asset's success is its adoption by the mainstream audience.  Bitcoin is seeing an exponential adoption within the mainstream with the **number of active addresses** seeing a clear upward trend in the past years. 

The same trend is seen for the **number of transactions per day** recorded on the bitcoin blockchain. 

**Volatility:**

Bitcoin's current price of $20,500 is almost a 70% price decrease from its all-time high of $69,000 back in November 2021.

But these price drops are also a great opportunity for new investors to enter the market and buy some bitcoin.

**Technology:**

There is no argument that bitcoin technology is truly revolutionary and is set to disrupt multiple industries, the biggest one of course being financial. 

In a matter of 10 years, blockchain has become a multi-billion dollar industry and is only expected to grow as its ecosystem expands.

I started to wonder some questions..

First off, im a big believer in bitcoin to replace traditional banking. To stop inflation and too powerful banks.

I always thought that when people (miners) wanted a hard fork with the doubled blocksize because of the increased mining rewards. But that the full nodes refused to update because the higher blockchain size. But then there is the whole Blocksteam story that core devs had other intrest because they also work at Blocksteam. if thats true, Isn't that a threat to decentralization? Or how much power do the core devs hold?

(if im confused i go to reddit sorry that why i have reddit lol)

First off, im a big believer in bitcoin to replace traditional banking. To stop inflation and too powerful banks.

I always thought that when people (miners) wanted a hard fork with the doubled blocksize because of the increased mining rewards. But that the full nodes refused to update because the higher blockchain size. But then there is the whole Blocksteam story that core devs had other intrest because they also work at Blocksteam. if thats true, Isn't that a threat to decentralization? Or how much power do the core devs hold?

(if im confused i go to reddit sorry that why i have reddit lol)

Fortunately, a millionaire full of money arrives and enters the only small hotel on town and asks for a room. He puts a $100 bill on the receptionist's desk and goes to see the room.

- The hotel manager grabs the note and rushes off to pay his debts with the butcher.

- The butcher grabs the note and rushes off to pay his debt with the pig farmer.

- The pig farmer rushes out to pay his debt to the miller who provides food for the animals.

- The miller takes the note and goes running to settle his debt with the street prostitute (in times of crisis, in that small town where everybody knows each other, she offers services on credit...

- The prostitute goes to the small hotel, where she had brought her clients the last few times and still hadn't paid. She hands over the note to the owner of the hotel.

At this moment the millionaire comes down, who has just seen the rooms, says that he is not convinced by any of them, and takes the note back.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

currently, I have seen loads of videos online warning retail investors to not invest and stack cash instead. however, for my situation i feel it might be a good time to continue DCA and i might even be able to attain another ETH which would

1. bring down my average price per ETH i own
2. have 1 ETH on hodlnaut earning interest while i slowly DCA into ETH attain one more and then transfer to a cold wallet. Because at the end of the day ... not your keys, not your coins.

Wanna hear what ya'll think. Which would be a better option?

1. Stack cash during these volatile times in the market (considering we're heading into recession.)
2. DCA into ETH on exchange which brings my overall spent on ETH down at the same time upon achieving my second ETH after DCA. Leaving the current ETH in hodlnaut while upon achieving the next ETH through DCA transfer into a cold wallet.

the Self::generate\_random(u64) that turns the u64 -&gt;  f64 in the range 0 ..1 is common  to all RNGMethods, but looping over this one 15  times costs about  150k compute units, whereas other methods can be run hundreds of times and only cost a few 10s of k's.
