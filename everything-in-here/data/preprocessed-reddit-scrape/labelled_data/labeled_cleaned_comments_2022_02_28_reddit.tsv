Congestion in Jan and the wormhole hack(although just a smart-contract issue) has shaken investors, TVL is at its lowest $ level in since Sept 2021.  I like to look at SOL/BTC which has been holding fairly well all things considered in current market conditions. Without any news to change the trend it will likely continue to follow BTC. Solana's time will likely come again with massive developer levels and improvements around congestion, but we might be waiting awhile as it is no longer the hottest coin.				1645947173	{}	hymauzl	False	t3_t29bzm	False	True	t1_hym86ec	/r/solana/comments/t29bzm/solana_overtaken_by_terra_in_market_cap/hymauzl/	1655117794.0	3	True	False	solana	t5_hcs2n		0	[]															in an overall down market solana has been hit with issues congestion in jan and the wormhole hack although just a smart contract issue has shaken investors tvl is at its lowest level in since sept 2021 i like to look at sol btc which has been holding fairly well all things considered in current market conditions without any news to change the trend it will likely continue to follow btc solana s time will likely come again with massive developer levels and improvements around congestion but we might be waiting awhile as it is no longer the hottest coin 	0.0026721276808530092	0.9879697561264038	0.4726978838443756	0.946423351764679	0.009133332408964634	0.5931597948074341	0.08596654236316681	8.584063948546827e-07	0.2873995304107666	0.015636131167411804

That said, I'll provide a contrarian view to others in this thread.

Improving your ability in Solidity won't directly translate to Solana dev, this is true. However, there are fundamental concepts that transcend chains (e.g. accounts, transactions, consensus, randomness, and time). Understanding fundamentals is a lot easier when you don't have to first understand references/borrowing and the many other nuanced language features of Rust.

I'd argue this is true even if you're a seasoned engineer. Moreover, learning with Solidity and going through the many many... many pains also provides perspective. Solana is built differently and places immense engineering effect on optimisations.

lol.

The Terra ecosystem is trying to solve something entirely different to Solana, they're not competitors. Moreover, both Do and Anatoly are openly collaborating together^[1]. If a co-existing chain flipping SOL's mcap is making you unhappy then perhaps like others have said, try diversifying. Over the last few weeks TFL released some incredible news (LFG^[2], exclusive partnership with MLB^[3], and raising $1B^[4] to purchase BTC to back the UST peg among other things). Conversely, Solana hasn't exactly seen positive news (Wormhole, network congestion, others?). It's no surprise SOL's price action isn't exciting and LUNA's.

Both chains are fantastic.
